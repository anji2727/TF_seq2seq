all right . 
but then i started school again , 
um , so i don't exercise as much as i'd like . 
but , i do enjoy , um , going to a gym and working out , 
or just like , i do sit ups sometimes before i go to bed or when i wake up , 
and i ride a exercise bike a lot . 
well , i try to do it at night before i go to bed . 
um , it's really weird , 
because i'll get down on the floor , 
and i'll holler and tell my cat nikki , 
and she can be upstairs in the bedroom , 
and i don't know . 
she knows what i'm talking about . 
you know , pretty soon , here she comes . 
so , i lay out there in the living room floor and do my exercises , you know . 
uh , i had a problem with my back , 
so , when i went to physical therapy 
so , i just try to keep that up , because it seems like if i don't , then my back gives me a problem again . 
so i try to do it every night , 
 and uh . 
 oh , that's good . 
it seems like it's , you know , 
i can tell when i do it and when i don't do it 
so you know it's got to be good for you . 
but , um , a long time ago i belonged to a gym 
 but , uh , now i notice that a gym that just opened up here about a month ago . 
so , i was kind of thinking about joining it , 
but i haven't even gone down there and talked to them yet . 
but , uh , it does really make you feel good , 
and i like to bicycle , too . 
oh , yeah . 
so , that gives you , you know , lots of exercise . 
it does . 
i enjoy that a lot . 
i , um , bike in the summer . 
i belong to a biking club here in kenosha . 
and , um , we go like fifty to a hundred miles every sunday . 
oh , my goodness . 
so  , i try to keep up in the winter with the exercise bike , so , i , you know , can be in shape   .
he exercises a lot more than i do , though . 
oh , really ? 
oh , yeah , 
but , i'm not that energetic .
i get lazy sometimes . 
well , like i say , i just do it at night , you know , 
and , um . 
try to get my stomach muscles toned up . 
oh , yeah , 
you know , because , boy , they seem like they really get out of shape , 
and once you get out of shape it's hard to get back into shape 
 so , i try to do it every night 
like i say , i'd rather do that than watch television anyhow 
so it's just kind of nice , and especially when i have my cat that comes down and joins me . 
oh , yeah , 
that is neat .
you know , so . well , i guess that's about all i can tell you about my exercising . 
i wish i knew how to swim , 
but i don't , 
so i don't go swimming . 
um , i don't swim much , neither . 
but they do say that swimming is really , really good for you 
so i wished i did know how to do that . 
if they had a pool here in patterson i'd probably , you know , put my bathing suit on and go down there , 
but they don't have a pool in this small city , either . 
oh . um . 
 so . well , listen then , 
it's been nice talking to you . 
okay then . 
um , bye . 
okay . 
do you , uh , do any woodworking ? 
and i really love it . um . 
oh , um , what do you do , 
for a hobby or for , 
 and i have my own equipment , 
and i have a jig saw and a scroll saw and , uh , in the process of getting a router 
 and so , i like to cut out my wood , and then tole paint on the items that i cut out . 
what kind of things do you like to do with wood ? 
 but , uh , he likes using the little band saws and jig saws 
 and then , uh , he's got a router , 
but now he wants a plunge router . 
but anyhow , he cuts them out , 
and then i took a tole 
and what we want to do is , you know , make them , and then maybe take them to these craft shows or 
but , uh , i really like it so far . 
oh , that is fun . 
and then my neighbor had a little doll made out of wood 
 so i took a pattern off of that , 
and then it's just a wooden doll with a painted face 
 and then you make the dress for it , 
and you drill holes around the top of the head 
and you stick in 
the twine . 
those are so cute . 
it looked really cute , you know . 
so i've got a couple of those started . 
they are really cute . 
uh , but as far as wood work , that's all we've been doing right now . 
oh , that sounds really fun . 
  well , they have a really fancy boutique out here in ogden , utah 
 and i just got back from that today , 
so if you could get your projects into boutiques , oh , they are wonderful . 
you could make a lot of money from those . 
what do you do ? 
i wonder how you , 
they buy them from you , 
or you just given them to them on consignment or something ? 
like that boutique , um , they take , oh what was it , twenty percent of the sell price . 
you would put your sell price 
 uh , and then they would take twenty percent off of that 
um , i see . 
and so then at the end of the boutique , which usually runs for a week , then they give you what you earned .
so , you have to decide what your price is going to be 
so if the customers are willing to pay it , then you get a profit . 
oh , these little things are so cute , though , you know . 
they are . 
 i have seen those . 
those are darling . 
i went through some of the books down here at the craft shop , you know 
 and , uh , there's a lots of little things you can get to cut out . 
in fact , i just sent to shop smith 
oh , that's what i want , is a shop smith .
that's my ul . 
oh , does he ? 
oh , that's my ultimate dream .
so anyhow . 
oh , you're lucky . 
well , uh , he's retired now 
 and , uh , i'm kind of semi retired . 
my company went bankruptcy , 
so i'm drawing my pension from them , 
but i'm still looking for a part time 
but , uh , he has all day long that 
how fun . 
and he's got a lot of tools , 
oh , how nice . 
i'm jealous . 
but , um , these little wooden things , they seem to sell really good . 
um , i know a lot of people that have gotten them , you know . 
my next door neighbor , every time she sees something , she thinks it's so cute she wants to buy it , you know .
so , i'm just hoping you know , that we can get some cut out and painted , you know , before summer starts 
but , uh . 
well , how is the market for things like that in california ? 
it seems like they go real good , you know . 
i mean , the country , anyhow , out here 
 and i live out in the valley 
 and country seems to be the in thing out here 
everybody wants little country pieces . 
so anything that looks like it might be country is what they want , you know . 
and , uh , this little rabbit that i made in , uh , tole painting class , you know , is like a welcome . 
it's going to have little wooden hearts holding it , in its hands 
i worked for a large corporation in the past 
and i think large corporations can give better benefits than small corporations because , right now i'm working for a very small corporation where the owner is right there 
and , uh , there is a lot of profit that's coming in 
but when it comes to , uh , small corporations they seem to pocket it a little bit quickly , or whatever , or however you want to say it 
we've got this amount of money , 
let's put into this plan , this plan , 
you got four oh one k plans . 
you have , uh , better vacation plans , uh , 
you have , just in general , maternity leave plans 
big corporations are able to do that versus small corporations , uh , you know , 
they just don't have the money or just feel that there isn't the need for it . 
so , i've worked for both big and small 
so i've had a chance to kind of take a look at , uh , the pros and cons of both . 
uh , well i worked for h and r block here in massachusetts 
and the only , 
they even hate to give out unemployment 
 and now i work for the framingham school system because i'm a teacher . 
and , uh , we have much better benefits , you know , in the system . 
we have a good pension plan . 
uh , let me see , we have a profit sharing plan to a degree . 
that's pretty good for , you know , being a school district type program . 
and we have the eye glasses , the health care 
that's extremely good . 
there's no type of , uh , savings of any sort that the company will reimburse you for . 
there's really , 
i think you're allowed a year . 
it's not accumulative , type of sick leave 
so i've been looking at big corporations and saying , the big corporation that i've worked for in the past had the pension plans , had the big health care , uh , 
you had your insurance 
and you didn't have to pay in as much as if you go to a very small place . 
uh , they don't have as good as insurance packages as big corporations . 
and  , 
the only trouble we've had here in massachusetts is the town and state employees 
my father's retired from the town of framingham 
 and he said that they haven't gotten a cost of living raise 
 and he said that's the only thing that really stinks as far as being retired 
and it's , hopefully 
but , uh , you know , i think the schools are at , where the schools isn't just the school system 
they took in the whole town plus all you know , 
is it a union ? 
but the town of framingham pays the benefits 
oh , that's pretty good . 
 and where it's a very large town , 
it's actually , should be a city 
but they kept it a town . 
uh , where it's extremely large , they were able to offer a little bit more which was 
i know what you mean 
and that's true . 
i mean , it does end up being quite a bit when you have to hire somebody for that position , sure . 
 because you know , the town employees , as far as , uh , electoral positions , are parttime . 
so it works out good because we 
 uh , but as far as shopping for a job , i'd rather shop for the benefits than the salary . 
well , that's it , you know , 
and i've kind of looked around , uh , at that , uh , too . 
because , uh , salary wise i don't think i'm making as much with a big corporation because i think when you look at big corps or large , 
i'm talking like hugh companies like three m , uh , uh , honeywell , uh , texas instruments 
i know people benefits that i wouldn't even dream of in a small corporation . 
you bring it up to the owner 
and it's like come on , you know . 
partly it's because the owner wants to keep getting richer and richer . 
and , of course , when it's a small corporation , it also wants to expand 
so that money is spent  , 
i don't know if you feel the same 
but , uh , when it comes to telling kids that they have to do , uh , two or three years of service into some kind of community , i don't know if that's appropriate for a government to suggest that and say , you know , you have to do two years of community service before you can be a citizen 
or , you know , in the aspect that we're telling kids that this is what is suggested for you to do . 
and , uh , uh , sociology course 
 but to tell them that they had to do two years thereafter , post high school , of community service , i'm not quite sure if that's appropriate for anybody to be telling somebody they have to do . 
um . well , that's a good idea to have it as a study program for school where it be more on a voluntary basis 
i kind of agree with that . 
uh , i don't think , 
you know , they should have the same rights as anyone else 
uh , anything shouldn't be mandatory , other than , i guess , like , uh , when you come to paying taxes or something like that . 
uh , or if it's beneficial in some kind of way then maybe 
and doing it for a purpose that they want . 
the other thing is this , 
i have thought about this on many times when you get these , uh , young troubled teenagers that , uh , don't have like the perspective uh , uh , of the community , a sense of community or perhaps the sense that they may have problems 
but there are other people out in the community that may have problems . 
then i can see it as like maybe a probationary type of thing . 
you have to do so much as far as in 
if they were , you know , abusive type of situation perhaps then they would have to work with the victims of abuse . 
or if , uh , they destroyed some property around the , uh , area , then they would have uh , to restore it and perhaps , uh , work , uh , for the community to beautify it or whatever 
and i think they have done that 
you may end up having to do some kind of community service 
so i could see that as something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled , 
so  , 
uh , that's a good idea . 
uh , i think they should have more programs like that . 
and i think , uh , us being taxpayers , we pay for , uh , people that's in jail or 
we sure do . 
 so they should be programs set up by the government that could utilize those forms in different areas .
yeah . 
but , uh , the thing is is that's not enough of that kind of stuff going on , uh 
 because like you say , is a lot of crimes and stuff or misdemeanors 
 so why have someone in jail for a year or two for a misdemeanor . 
and sometimes , you know , putting them in jail doesn't really help 
 and then when they get out , they , 
because they have this stigmatism of being in jail . 
and there's a lot of anger , sure . you know , especially if they haven't went through treatment 
and they dealt with other people in the , uh , system of prisons which , uh , you always deal with somebody that's a little bit worse than yourself next to you or whatever . 
i would say the crimes would probably be , you know , 
if you went in for a certain crime , there might somebody that has done a crime even worse than what you have , 
so you're dealing with people , uh , that may , uh , be an influence later on 
but i didn't get any rehabilitation 
 uh , you know . but then again , those that have physically assaulted somebody , uh , that's extremely tough to put them into some kind of program out in 
uh , i don't know about you , 
but , uh , i work outside the home 
and , uh , in fact , uh , i'll be leaving very shortly to go to work 
and i work different shifts so are pretty much a later shift to where i don't have the family time . 
uh , when my husband gets home , he's home with my daughter alone 
and then a couple of hours later i'm home . 
uh , i don't know , 
i'm finding that more and more people that i talk to , there's less and less family time available to them . 
and , uh , it seems that or your employers seem to be taking more and more time away from the family . 
so , you know , if you do have any time , it's kind of like on a rush cycle that you have to get so many other things done , uh , plus try to have that relationship with your children , 
and it's a very hard juggling act . 
i agree .
and , you know , i look at my daughter 
and she's now , uh , going to be four 
and she's growing fast 
i know that i have three children . 
and , uh , i stay home . 
i don't work . 
and , uh , i know that and also your children . 
because i know my husband , if i were gone as much as he is 
 and i also notice that the children that come over here to play 
they don't want to play around adults . 
they don't want to be around you . 
they don't want you to tell them what to do . 
they want to do their own thing . 
and they're the very same age as my children . 
 and i'm finding as i volunteer up at the school , i just , being , uh , 
i'm not educated at all in , uh , really detecting this 
but i can talk to the teacher and tell them , on a pretty good basis , after i've worked up at the school for a couple of weeks 
and you can just tell in their personalities and how they respond to the adults are home and the ones even that are at home that are getting the love and attention that they need . 
not that the kids that go out aren't getting that 
it's just a different , 
they are more use to being with their own age kids 
they're not use to being with adults and to responding 
i    , 
 uh , i think the trend in the united states , 
i feel really bad that it's turned so much 
i think so too . 
in fact , uh , i spent the first three years at home with my daughter , 
so i guess i felt fairly fortunate that i was able to do that . 
and i did notice the difference between those of infants being placed in daycare 
whatever the employer says you have to be back at work is basically when you have to be back at work , whether it be six weeks or three or four . 
but how these women must feel to place their children into care 
you need this job . 
it's a little bit financial type thing 
because , uh , if you look all over in the other countries , like europe and that , uh , their standards of living are a lot less than what ours are 
got a parttime job 
i'll have the car 
and really past generation women have done it to women of this day and age too , uh , 
because our financial situations are as , it almost takes two people to bring in an income to support a family now 
it's hard . 
it really is hard . 
i know that my husband and i have to do a lot of sacrificing 
i did it 
 and , uh , 
and , uh , it cost us a lot of financial problems doing it 
and you're not getting any further , you know , along 
 and you have to make that decision to go back to work parttime or go back to work fulltime 
and you have to make that decision 
and it's a tough one . 
i think 
 and i , 
i think with working moms , if you can get the bosses to give you almost like a rotation like they're going to do with yearround school where you work , 
okay . 
so , what do you think about it ? 
um , i like you put , you know , 
when people got to the point where they were debilitated and couldn't take care of themselves 
 and there was no other choice . 
you couldn't take them in your own home , 
then they went into a nursing home . 
you know , maybe you lived too far away to care for them , 
or your daily job or whatever prevented it . 
but , um , i like the choices you have now , where they can go into an apartment type setting and basically have a independent lifestyle , but assisted care . 
and then if things deteriorate , they can go to a second level which is , you know , like , where they prepare their meals for them 
 and they still live somewhat independently 
but they have people checking on them and making sure they have hot meals . 
and then where the same community a lot of times will also have the third level , which is full care , you know , where they're in a wheelchair or where they're in a bed , 
and they can't get around 
but then they have full care . 
but i really like those options now , 
they're very active right now , 
but they're seventyfive and seventytwo . 
so , that comes up somewhat more often in my thoughts as i see these things 
um , it's funny 
because , um , i know people that are in all three , and people that work , you know , 
i know someone that works in all three different stages like you said . 
and i have known , you know , people close to me that have been in all three , 
and i have seen them like go from where they're in an apartment building , 
we call it , um , 
well , we have high rises , 
and it's just for elderly people , you know , 
or one of their spouses has already passed away . 
and it's really nice for them because then they're with people their own age , and people that have gone through things exactly what they have gone through . 
and , it's really nice to go and see them , you know , where they can still get around and everything , 
and they still , you know , do their own thing , 
but it's really nice to see them because , 
i mean sometimes , 
like i had a great aunt , 
she lived with us for , um , three months , because she's starting to get alzheimer's disease . 
and i know i have a bunch of younger brothers and sisters , 
and i know it was hard for me as well as it was for them to actually sit down , because she doesn't like doing things that the younger kids like doing . 
and to actually sit , 
so it's really nice to see that . 
that's some of the things i would find important before is like you're saying , a good mix of people who have the same interests . 
uh , and the programs , 
uh , besides just different levels within the same program , they have different types of programs . 
they have several areas . 
they have one area in town where the people , 
i guess a lot of it comes with money . 
this one area is a bit more expensive , 
and the people who probably are living there have had more money in their life . 
but things that people where they have similar interests . 
like you're saying , 
and the programs that they have , where some of them will have dances once a week 
 and some of them sponsor different crafts , 
and they go to the arboretum to see things , 
and they make sure that if they want to go to church , there's a bus there . 
you know , maybe it's thirty minutes away , 
because you know , dallas area is a big metropolitan area . 
but a lot of these places have individual transportation . 
that's something i'd look for , something that would make me happy personally if i had to live there . 
because even in the nice ones , and even in the ones where they can live fairly independently , they really don't necessarily like it 
so i think those kinds of things , to make it more homelike and to make it more , um , enjoyable for them . that'd be one thing i'd look for , along with the , uh , health care aspects 
um , i'm in college , 
and i'm only twentyone 
but i had a speech class last semester , 
and there was a girl in my class who did a speech on home care of the elderly . 
and i was so surprised to hear how many people , 
like whenever they're in , you know , the older people , they're like , um , fastened to their beds so they can't get out just because you know , they wander the halls .
and so many of them , you know , are , 
are overmedicated , too . 
and you know , what some of these people really went through . 
and i forget the percentage of people you know , that she had said , 
and i mean , she did research on it and everything . 
that's one of the things the money that it now requires to , uh , be in one of these places . 
because some of these people that are just on social security , 
and if they don't have any living relatives , 
perhaps they never had children 
or if their children , you know , passed away before they did 
or minimal care 
and are paid at a minimum wage , 
and they don't care as much . 
the caretakers in some cases are trying to make easy on themselves to the point where they're putting people in bed or overmedicating them so they'll stay in one spot and not do anything . 
that certainly would be something to watch for . 
because some of these places can even be two and three thousand dollars a month to stay in ,   .
i know , 
and sometimes they share a room , 
and it's just a little cubbyhole , 
and they share it with another person , 
and they're still paying that much . 
oh , yeah , 
so you've , 
it just sometimes , it just seems ridiculous . 
you've got to really strike a balance in unfortunately what you can afford at the same time . 
um , i've been lucky , 
well , my mom's , um , parents , they're both in their , uh , eighties , 
and i was just home for spring break 
stay in the house as long as you can . 
well , like there are other communities , too , that aren't necessarily a nursing home . 
i had an aunt who lived in a small town in texas that , um , was in a , 
it was a housing division . 
each person had their own little bitty house 
and it was , um , supplemented , 
most of them were on social security , 
and they got some kind of supplemental aid besides from the state government . 
but it was this little bitty one bedroom house , 
but it was a separate house , 
and they had a living room , and a bedroom and a kitchen ,
all these houses , 
were like fifteen or twenty of them all right together kind of like on one block . 
and they had a supervisory , um , 
wasn't a house , really , 
it was more like , um , a headquarters 
it sounds like , uh , an apartment or som , 
and someone ,
and they always cooked , 
then they had the choice , you know , 
they lived in their own little house . 
they had their own possessions still in there , you know , some of them . 
and they could make their own breakfast if they wanted to , and their own dinner , 
and they always had somebody come in for lunch . 
but you know , they didn't have to mess with the yard . 
they had people who did the yard , 
and they had a maid uh , uh , service that came in and cleaned everybody's house . 
so they didn't have to worry about that . 
oh , yeah . 
and it was really a nice compromise , especially , because she felt like she was still living in her own house . 
and she still had her own couch , and her own bed , 
and it really helped a lot , 
and she was a lot more comfortable , 
and she didn't resent   like having to be in a situation , because she still had a lot of her own possessions . 
oh , really ? 
see , now we've run into a lot of problems where our relatives were , 
well , i've lived here for thirty years , 
and this is our home , 
and we have nothing else to show for our lives , 
and we don't want to leave . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , we've run into a lot of that . 
it would be hard to . 
that's why this , 
she felt that way , too , 
but it helped that she got to still be in a house and still have some of her own stuff . 
and i guess that , 
it was a pilot program i think , where she lived , 
so it's probably not widely available . 
that's what like , 
well , um , now i know we have an ol , 
we call it an old folks home , 
but it's basically a nursing home too , 
but everyone has basically their own room . 
and you know , th , 
none of them have cars because they can't drive . 
but if someone would come to get them , you know , they're allowed to leave with them , 
and there's a staff there that makes supper for them , 
and each person has a chore , 
like maybe wednesday night it's george's turn to set all the tables . 
and it's really nice because that keeps them going , too , rather than just sitting around . 
and i know , um , our youth group goes over 
and we play bingo with them and , you know , like , 
that's good . 
everybody needs some sense of responsibility . 
an even if it's just a little bit . 
just to keep them going . 
so , to set the table , like you're saying , or whatever 
that would be nice . 
but i think before i , 
like you , 
i don't think it's right to just put someone in it . 
i think they would have to agree to go in it . 
unless they're at a point where they're mentally 
well , yeah . 
like you're saying with alzheimer's and stuff , they're going to be some people who have to be there 
and that's when it's important to really check out the medical aspects of it , when you're in something like that ,
okay . 
um , but anyway , so , so as far as , 
we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v 
and we just don't want that . 
we want more communication and interaction , you know , amongst us as a family . 
and we both like sports , 
so we figured , well what better way to get out and , you know , be together as a family 
and plus , we both like to cook , 
so , you know , that's something we spend time together too , is , you know , cooking and , uh , preparing meals and stuff . 
that's about all we've discussed as far as for family . 
well see , i'm the third oldest of twelve children . 
oh my gosh . 
so like i said , i , 
and i'm only twentyone . 
i'll be twentytwo next month . 
so there's nine that are younger than me . 
my youngest sister is five . 
oh yeah . 
and like i sa , i don't have any children . 
i'm just engaged , 
and i'm getting married in october , 
and we haven't discussed this at all . m . 
long way down the road , right . 
but , um , now i've noticed that like , while i'm at college , and when i go home , you know , my , 
i'm really close to the younger ones , 
and , um , like , like when i do go home they enjoy just laying around me , you know , 
like if we do watch t v at night , they just like enjoy just , like laying on top of me or something . 
they like that . 
but , um , as far as that goes , like we play games , 
i play like old maid and fish with them , 
and we play board games , 
and when it's ni , 
like i'm from pennsylvania , 
so when it's nice out , we go outside , 
and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff . 
and in the summer like , i think there's like seven of us still at home , 
and all seven are in a sport , 
like also   the girls are in softball 
and the boys are in baseball . 
so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports , 
that's it , you know . 
well do you , 
so if you're , if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers' 
well , that's good , too , i mean , as far as entering , 
i mean , you're , you're participating , 
but you're not , you know . 
i mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff 
and that's , 
because , um , even if our kids , you know , get into sports that we're really not interested in , i want them , you know , to know that we're still there 
well , it's funny because , um , well , my mom and dad both were kind of athletic . 
they both grew up on a farm , 
but although , you know , it wasn't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such , my mom and dad got into it more than i did . 
i mean , they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling , you know , 
cheering you on and stuff . 
a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as the kids , 
and i found , like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff , it was really funny because the crowds would like you know , get into fights , who can scream louder , and you know , everything . 
so it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it , 
and they're not really even participating . 
well , that would be fun . 
boy , so and do things together ,
but it's 
so , if you're not , 
what if , 
do people go off in their own little groups with that many ? 
i mean , did like some people go to their rooms and    , 
it's , um , 
but , um , like i say , you know , i'll be twentytwo next month , 
and i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age . 
and i think ,
and the younger kids are at home , 
and i like to spend time with them . 
but when you were growing up and the younger ones weren't around , what did you do ? 
oh , i see . 
but now that they've all sort of moved off , 
so , do you think , even , 
i mean , what did you do when you were younger , 
did you go do the board games and stuff , 
you still did what you do now . 
oh , yeah . 
and we would make , 
like in the winter when it wa , 
we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff 
 uh , clear out our basement , 
and we would like , do , just , even stupid things , 
like we try hurtling our couches and stuff . you know , and . 
hurling . 
oh , hurtle , 
oh , okay . 
to see who could jump over , you know . 
we just made up our own stupid little games . 
and like hide and seek , 
well , we have a bigger house than a lot , you know , 
our house isn't the average small one . 
so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that . 
so you had a lot of games and things you played 
well see , like we're all pretty close together . 
like , my sister that's closest to me , we're only fourteen months apart . 
so there was never just one alone , you know . 
not real spread in age . 
so we were all pretty close where we always had a buddy to play with ,
gosh , twelve , 
is that pretty common up there , uh , in , 
oh , okay . 
i mean , i don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more . 
i mean 
but , i mean , that's his mother 
and , i mean that's , 
well , yeah , 
i'm catholic .
well that's it then , i think , 
probably maybe that . 
but , see , um , when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five . 
well , i've even cut that down now , 
um , but to me five wasn't even a lot , because i was just so used to twelve . 
you know . 
 but it's so expensive , man . 
but , yeah , 
it would be really hard now to have twelve children . 
i would think for your parents it would still be hard even nowadays , i mean , just to raise twelve kids . 
would be , shoosh . 
and he put himself through college , 
and , um , there's a sister older than me , 
she's still living at home , 
but she works 
and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit , you know , of rent money . 
and i'm putting myself through college , 
and like i'm getting married in october , 
and my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding . 
and then my brother right behind me , he moved out , 
and he has an apartment , 
and he works , 
and then the next one down is in the marines , 
and he's out of the house . 
so , it's kind of like they don't , you know . 
well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though , you know . 
i mean 
i think they do . 
 so you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself ,
like , uh , well , i find it a lot when i'm up here at college because i've always had a bank account , 
i've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade . 
you know , i would work in the summer , 
and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or , you know , 
like my roommate's laughing you know , at me , you know , because their schooling's paid for . 
or manage money or know , 
know , you know , how to even go about getting money . 
you know , how to get a job or you know , just when you get a job , what your responsibility is . 
are you going to blow all that money , 
how easy it is to blow money you earn . 
see , and then , my mom and dad , like whenever , like we would go out and we would get a summer job , 
and then we would start blowing money , 
so from high school ,
like i'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because i'm still in school , 
but i have my own policy , too . 
so i had a poli , 
you know , my mom and dad got it set up , you know , you know , helped me to get it and everything , 
and i have my own policy , 
and then i pay for my own life insurance too . 
and then 
because my mom said , that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it , 
if we were in a wreck , you know , you can be sued for anything now . 
and she said that's really not fair to the younger kids . 
if we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued 
and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad , 
and the little kids would have nothing . 
and i agree with her . 
you know , i don't know . 
so you know , if we want to drive , we pay our own insurance , 
so really , i think , sometimes there's an advantage , 
i mean , sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent . 
it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted 
so , um , i don't know , 
but now , it is hard , i can imagine , on your parents , you know  . . . 
so you watch david letterman ? 
well , see our favorite t v show , 
i live in a dorm 
 and our favorite t v show is cheers . 
oh , really , 
that's pretty awesome , too . 
i watch it every now and then . 
that's hilarious . 
well , we try , 
like here they show it , like , every day . 
oh , serious .
and then , like , on thursdays is the night where the new ones come on . 
oh , that's cool . 
but we watch it like every day . 
but like , late night , we don't watch , uh , 
what we do is , we stay up till around one thirty , 
and then they show the twilight zone at one thirty , 
and so we just stay and watch that . 
twilight zone rules , man . 
the what ? 
that's all . 
i used to live in the house that the guy owned . 
are you serious ? 
and we didn't have enough books to fill it up 
that's psychedelic . 
oh , he just , like , totally sarcastic and hilarious 
and , i don't know , 
i'm a lot like him in a way , 
so the , 
and so do i 
oh , do you watch saturday night live ? 
he's got what ? 
curly hair 
and so do i , 
so hey .
hey i got long hair , 
how long is it ? 
uh , i don't know , 
but people , 
the other day i went into a bar 
and this guy asked me to dance . 
all he saw was my hair 
you better be . 
that's hilarious . 
do you watch saturday night live yesterday ? 
with the , uh , 
who was on , the music people , 
wasn't that fishbone . 
yeah 
i saw that , 
it was awesome . 
but i didn't see the rest of it . 
oh , you missed wayne's world . 
are you serious ? 
wayne's world was pretty cool . 
they're awesome . 
so , uh , let's see , 
what else . 
uh , see , like , like , every time we walk in the room we turn on the t v 
oh , really ? 
that sucks . 
so all we do is turn , 
like , like , when i was in high school i used to do , like , my homework in front of the t v set ,
uh , kind of annoying 
but that's cool . 
kind of annoying like , in front of t v , like trying to do homework , you know . 
trying to write an essay , you start talking about , you know , like , in living color or something , 
i don't know . 
well , i just bogused on all my homework 
so it really didn't matter .
b s 
that's the way to do it . 
i know , 
and i did that all through college 
and it worked .
works for me . 
so , uh , let's see , 
what else . 
like , the news we don't watch ,
i watched through the war , you know , 
there's only one . 
especially the war , 
i know , 
i guess they think that people don't watch t v , 
but i mean if you watch it for , like , five minutes , then it repeats everything over and over and over . 
i know . 
and in north c , 
see they just give you like local news , okay . 
like , a house burned down in this little town . 
and were here , 
it's like , you know , even though two hundred and fifty thousand people died somewhere else , they're not going to tell you , you know , 
they're going to spend more time on doing on a cross guard who's a hundred and five years old ,
but , uh , let's see , 
what else . 
oh , we watch , like for example , uh , 
do you watch star trek ? 
but i used to . 
well i used to hate star trek . 
i thought , 
like , like , when i was , like , in high school and junior high school , i used to hate it 
 but then we started watching it . 
and , like , the new ones are pretty cool because , 
oh , really , 
that's cool . 
because what happened is , like they have this hologram right ,
and you can program 
and everything looks real 
and you can touch everything and stuff . 
are you serious ? 
oh , man . 
but it's only a program 
and it's really great because sometimes like the hologram makes up all these things 
and , uh , i mean sometimes it's funny , 
sometimes it's not , 
but , uh , you know , 
that's cool . 
sound like   .
and then we watch football . 
uh , yeah , 
basketball's cool , 
but football kind of after a while , 
which basketball ? 
it's more spirited   .
we got two teams of the a c c going there . 
oh , yeah ? 
we got duke and north carolina . 
but , i mean there's nothing to do , 
you know , it's like we just woke up , 
we had a hangover and everything , you know . 
and so we just woke up 
and , uh , we're watching t v , 
today we're just going to dedicate  ourself  to watching golf 
you know , i was , 
like , a whole golf tournament , it's , 
like , for example , baseball , 
i hate baseball , 
i mean , 
oh , me , too . 
and the actual play time that there is 
because the play time is 
that's true . 
and that's , like , you know , five seconds for the whole play 
that's true . 
 and that's it . 
i mean , maybe a home run could last a little bit longer because the guy has to run around all the bases , you know . 
but i mean , it's , it's like that , 
i mean it's just , 
but when i went home that's all , like , they had on t v 
ooh , really ? 
 so i watched entire games of baseball 
and t v in argentina's really bad . 
oh , really . 
from argentina , why'd you come over here ? 
uh , because , uh , i wanted to go to school here . 
oh , that's cool . 
how long did you live there ? 
they have better computer science up here than they do down there . 
uh , my father works for i b m , 
and we came up here , 
well , we came to the united states in nineteen seventysix , 
then we moved back . 
that's cool . 
so i did my undergraduate in two years . 
oh , really ? 
it's just , you know , 
that's cool . 
and , uh , well , tell your dad that now he owes you five bucks . 
no doubt . 
all right , 
nice talking to you . 
you , too . 
hi , kay . 
i , uh , was thinking about salaries and benefits and 
well , um , we just recently graduated from rice university , 
and , uh , we were going through a lot of job interviews and things , 
and some of the things that were important to me , uh , when my husband was looking for his job , was , um , hours , you know , 
he'd been in graduate school so i was used to his not being home at all .
so i you know , didn't want him to have a job that would make him kind of be on call all the time , and have to go in at any time , and 
so that was important to me , and also insurance for our family 
i don't ever want to have to worry about that . 
that's real important to me . 
um , you know we have that aetna 
that's the insurance that we have right now . 
us , too . 
when we were in colorado , they had , um , a different type of h m o there that i really liked a lot . 
it was , um , not that kind of h m o s where you have to go to their sort of like clinics , you know 
 but this was just an h m o where you could go to private practice doctors and to the regular hospitals and all that , 
but it was with a certain list of doctors that , you know , participated 
and , um 
well , that's nice . 
for us it was a five dollar copayment every time you went to the doctor , and , uh , three dollars for the prescriptions . 
that's good . 
and , uh , i especially liked the prescription , especially since my children tend to have ear infections all the time .
those prescriptions can be very expensive . 
oh , i know . 
we just went through that ourselves . 
we just , you know , are like fifty dollars for this series of antibiotics and things . 
oh , i know , 
especially if you get , what is it , seclor i think that 
it's pretty bad . 
well , yeah , 
and um , we were interested in having dental insurance , too , 
because , um , having been in school , we kind of put things off 
we have , um , you know 
we're at aetna with an , uh , ex , 
we have like the dental insurance is separate . 
is that what you mean ? 
i don't think it's the basic , 
i think it's the other one . 
the one that's like you get additional , 
they'll pay a little bit more 
we just have the basic right now , 
and for most things it tends to cover it .
we don't too many major , um , expenses at this point , 
but we have been able to find dentists that will accept pretty much whatever the basic plan pays . 
a couple of times we've had to pay , oh i don't know , three to five dollars but 
that's great . 
we need to go shopping for dentists and things like that too . 
and , let's see , 
besides insurance , other things that we looked at , um , 
well , my husband does not like to commute 
and we don't like him to be , you know , having to drive an hour to work or something .
we don't like that either .
so we kind of looked for uh , his office would be located 
is his office in plano ? 
oh , that's not bad . 
um , especially when they finish all the construction out here 
 and we didn't want him you know , to , 
like we had some job offers in the new york area , 
and we thought , well , you know , he would be really commuting 
oh , yes , 
you're not kidding . 
 and not only is it , you know , trouble to have to drive , but it takes time away from your home and your family when you're out driving . 
that's right . 
and , um , so , that was something that was important to us , 
and , because , like i say , we kind of felt deprived that he had been in school and been away from us for so long  , 
we were anxious to do everything we could to have , you know , made us be more together , 
and what other , 
can you think of another thing that you guys looked at 
well , those are some of the things that are very important to us too . 
um , we'd like , you know , other benefits that are provided , um , 
the athletic facilities that you sometimes take advantage of 
but i have to say that since we've come here we haven't done it too much though , 
we haven't enrolled in too many of the classes or any of that . 
but that's a nice benefit to have . 
that's true . 
that's really important . 
um , also , what , um , opportunities there would be for advancement , i think , we looked at besides just , you know , what salary you would be having now . 
but when could , uh , your salary increase 
 um , was there somewhere to go . 
that's one of , i think , the hard things right now , 
i mean they're going through some tough times 
i know many of us are thankful that he still has a 
that we can make our mortgage payments 
and , yeah , 
that's really true . 
um , if an employee is especially exemplary , i think it's often , 
in a smaller company it's a little bit easier for them to say , hey , you know , this person did a wonderful job , give him a big bonus kind of thing . 
a lot of times 
 and you have to have guidelines , you know , for salary increases , and things like that , 
that's one of the things when you're dealing with a large company . 
but , we also were interested in , um , you know , being sure that he felt like he liked the people that he would be working with 
but , so that's something that was important to him , in thinking he could work under . 
oh , just since last summer . 
it's only been , not even a year yet , 
well , i was going to say  , it sounds like uh , to choose in a position and have a lot of thought put into it . 
in a big company , though , you also get moved around a lot .
yes , well . 
he may be having to drive over here to lewisville some time . 
oh , yeah . 
or we may be having to drive to plano , 
you never know . 
you never know , 
we're hoping that that won't be the case .
i think one of the most deciding factors of why we chose , um , this area is that , um , my husband was raised in irving 
 and so we have a lot of family here , his side of the family . 
and being , 
when we were down in houston , we were isolated , 
i mean , it's not that far , but , people would ha , 
we didn't have anyone in town that was our family . 
and although we had really good friends and we had church and school support and things , um , we were anxious to move close to family members , just because we wanted our children to know their grandparents and things like that . 
we're very , 
so , that really made a big difference , i think , in why we chose t i , and chose to move this way . 
we're very far from our families , 
and it's really hard . 
i have little children , 
and , um , they were the only grandchildren , 
and so , are really far away . 
in fact , this is a little off the topic , but yesterday , my mother happened to be on a train going from phoenix back to chicago 
 and it stopped in dallas for half an hour , so i loaded the kids in the car , 
and we went downtown , and met her train for half an hour , and brought her a little snack and an easter basket 
oh , that's nice . 
and i think it is important to , you know , want to be close to your family 
and it's hard , 
i mean , just for us to snatch a half hour like that 
so , um , 
that's the same ,
it's nice . 
we're really enjoying it . 
i wonder what it would be like , 
i mean , i wanted to be close to family , but i also thought it would be harder to be close to family . 
sometimes it can be . 
 but it's turned out really good , 
and i think that , you know , we're really satisfied with that choice , 
and we , you know , kind of felt like , um , it was worth it 
that's good . 
well , my children just ran out the door , so i need to go check on them .
well i've really enjoyed the conversation . 
well , i have too . 
and , uh , nice to have met you , 
and you have a good day . 
you too . 
if you want to go first , go ahead . 
oh , i think that a woman's role has come a long way . 
we have gone more into the business aspect like i say , of , i don't know , working more , 
and i think we've even gone into more the labor aspect of it also .
i feel that , uh , we've missed as far as the top jobs go .
because if you look at most corporations , there isn't a woman , you know , that's on the board of directors , or that type of thing , 
they are mostly all men . 
there may be a few , but very incidental . 
 and i really think that it will be a long time , probably , before we see that . 
in one sense , i'm an older person , in my fifties , so i feel that we've lost some things in the sense that women have to work today .
it's mostly , you know , 
even if you want to say home , you really can't . 
 and a lot of times you can't , 
you know , it's gotten to be a two income family to just survive today between taxes and the cost of living , 
and i don't think raises have kept up with , you know , a lot of the stuff , you know , as far as your medical insurance and just groceries and gasoline and all , you know . 
so i think that we did come a long way in the sense that you know , like you say , we're out in the labor force , but i think we've lost something too . 
my mom , she's a housewife , 
and , well , there is twelve kids in my family , 
so my mom never could really work , you know , because she was kind of pregnant from day one . 
she never really had a chance to work . 
she worked before she got married , 
but , uh , uh , she doesn't believe in , 
she's very old fashioned . 
she doesn't believe in the woman working unless she has to . 
that's what i mean , 
if you are not going to have a family , then that's fine , 
then , you know , a career is a smart choice . 
and i think it's great , but if you have a family , i think you owe the family a responsibility . 
and to have children and just get a day care or someone to take care of it , and not really have the bonding process that takes place with babies and stuff , you know 
and i think that's why there is so many problems 
because they don't have the family roots anymore . 
you know , i'm not saying that it's totally gone , but it's nothing like what it used to be .
and also like my mom thinks , 
i mean she's kind of right with it , 
when both partners of the marriage work , she feels that that's taking more away , 
that's increasing more unemployment for people that need to work .
oh , definitely . 
you know , she feels if there is women out there just because they want to do it , she said , you know , they could stay at home , 
that's right , 
they don't want to take care of the kids .
that's very true , but then they shouldn't have a family . 
that's what i'm saying , you know , 
i think it's great that women have a choice today .
like basically there's contraceptives and 
there is no need to have children if you don't want them . 
what do you think about that , 
do you think that , uh , 
what do you think about the women that are not having families because they want to continue their business ? 
that's fine , 
that's the freedom of choice . 
and i agree with that , 
because anyone who has children that doesn't really want them isn't going to be a good parent . 
well , i shouldn't say they are not going to be a good parent . 
they won't be a caring parent . 
like they won't have that , 
or they won't be as good as they could be . 
that's what i mean , 
they'll feel like it's a job . 
it's not like something that they really wanted . 
like i had three children , 
and i mean i wanted every one of them . 
i'm not sorry i had any of them , 
and i worked third shift for a good part of my life just so i would be home with them . 
you know , i had to work , but i tried to make it as painless as possible . 
in fact , at one time i worked as a second shift , 
and one saturday morning we were all sitting at the breakfast table , 
and the kids were talking , daddy this , daddy that , daddy this , daddy that , 
and i was sitting there . 
it was like i didn't belong anymore . 
and it was because i had worked for about nine months , 
and when they were coming home i was going to work . 
and i wasn't there at supper time or bed time , 
or they couldn't tell me what went on at school because they would be coming in the door , 
i would be going out . 
so we were , 
i felt i was losing my family . 
and that's why i said that's it , 
i either have to quit or , you know , try something else , 
so i went on third shift . 
and i worked that shift for eleven years . 
oh , my . 
just so that my kids would have me at home . 
you know , and i feel that's very important , 
it really is , 
and it's too bad because mothers miss out on so much too . 
so i mean in the sense that we've come a long way , 
but we've sacrificed a lot to get there . 
i agree . 
and , uh , i really think that uh , like after the second world war when women went to work in factories and all that , that was like out of necessity , because the men weren't here anymore . 
but then it got to be a point where they got some independence . 
and they just enjoyed the income , the extra . 
a man can afford the necessities , a woman affords the luxuries . 
and i notice today kids , you know , 
like we had apartments before we had homes . 
and we had to walk before we had a car . 
and now kids at sixteen years old , they have their birthday , 
what do they get , 
they get a car . 
oh , i know .
and to me , it's like we've lost our values in this country . 
we really have , 
and unless you earn something and you've worked for it , and you have a sense of pride about it , 
because while i did this you know , no one gave it to me . 
you will take better care of that , 
and you will prize that possession .
and it's just like college too , 
i think that if a kid goes to college , and you can help them , fine , but i don't think you should pay the whole way . 
see , yeah , 
see , now , my parents , there is no way they could afford to send twelve kids to college . 
of course . 
and so far there is only two of us that have gone , 
and my older brother has paid his entire way , 
and i'm on my , 
i have six weeks left 
and you know , i'll graduate , 
and i paid my entire way , 
and that's the way it'll go down the line , 
and like i don't have a car because i'm paying for college , 
and if i want a car , 
my parents always said if we wanted a car , we paid for the car , and we paid for our own insurance , 
and i think that's right 
but i'll bet your values are a lot higher , you know , and your self esteem and the way you , uh , you know , think about things is probably 
like i've had my , you know , 
like i know kids up here that have their own cars 
and money is just given to them , 
like they still get their allowance , 
they are twenty years old and they still get an allowance . 
well , i have held a summer job , you know , since you know , i was in the eleventh grade , 
and i have had to take care of my own money , 
have my own checking account , 
i pay for my own life insurance , 
and i know a lot of kids that don't even know , 
i mean i tell them i pay for my own life insurance and their mouths just drop to the floor , you know . 
they probably don't even have any . 
well , if they do , they don't know it , you know .
and that's what i say , you'll be so much better off for it as you get older , 
because , you know , a lot of kids resent things that parents tell them and stuff , 
but it's because you've been there .
oh , i know . 
 you know , you are going to find out for yourself , 
but i mean i don't think you should just not listen to advice , even if you don't take it , just listen . 
you know , there is no harm in that , whereas sometimes you can't even get that from a kid , you know . 
but really , uh , 
what do you feel the changes in the future , like with the abortions and that type of thing , women in politics and 
actually i think abortion is going to take a turn where there is not going to be as many , 
because i think contraceptives are going to be more popular . 
i mean i realize that they are popular now , 
but i think , i really think people are going to start using more contraceptives 
and with the abortion , i don't think there is going to be as many abortions , but i don't know what women will do when they get into politics , you know , about abortion . 
i think it will be freedom of choice . 
well , i still think people have a choice . 
you know , if you can live with it , and you know , your conscience is clear 
exactly , yeah . 
i don't know . 
i mean no one has said for sure , you know . 
which i mean i think it should be anyway . 
i do . 
i'm catholic , 
and we are not supposed to , you know , say that that's okay , but i really feel that it's freedom of choice . 
because i mean you as an individual , what you do , that to me is your business . 
and , uh , 
and different circumstances call for different things . 
that's  . . . 
well , i haven't , uh , you know , 
when the war was on i watched c n n and , uh , nightline 
but when , uh , 
lately , like the last week or two i guess with easter  ,
have you been keeping up ? 
i guess , you know , the thing really isn't over . 
 uh , i don't know if you call it standout or whatever 
but anyway they stopped and waited to see if iraq would accept a permanent cease fire situation though . 
as i understand it , from the iraqi point of view this current cease fire thing that the u n , uh , had set up , you know , the iraqis are probably not going to go for at all ,
so , i guess , from what i understand the thing could just 
start up . 
there's no official document signed or anything ? 
well , i , um , 
i couldn't remember things that i had studied in the past in school and all 
so i got out like my encyclopedias and tried to read about the history . 
and it was really , what i felt was kind of cynical 
because it 
there just hasn't been any peace over there ever .
i don't know ,
that's right . 
and it's just not people 
and it's not , uh , you know , 
there isn't any real arab coalition because they do fight among themselves . 
and they fight with each other 
and they have such hatred for , uh , israel 
uh , the thing that's kind of interesting about this , 
my sons in the air force . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , he came within a quarter of an inch of going , uh , to saudi , 
he ended up in korea instead because of the way they split a transportation group out in lubbock . 
so he ended up going to korea 
and his buddies ended up going to saudi . 
well , he's still in korea and his buddies home now .
that he could have gone home . 
and got it over with . 
well , i just , 
there's just no way for us to be involved over there and hope that there will be much peace . 
and , um , with , 
and i'm afraid that we would have to stay . 
the country of kuwait was just , you know , somebody's uh , 
you go back to world war i when the , uh , ottoman empire broke up 
and they split things along , um , geographical lines but they didn't take any kind of consideration into , uh , social or cultural things at all . 
so , the country of , 
it's like any other country , you know , 
for whatever reason it's , it's actually there . 
well , iraq has had , uh , designs on that place since nineteen twentytwo 
so , you know , it wasn't like something that just suddenly popped up . 
and it's just that this was an excuse , you know , to make some noise .
now , something that i read in the paper the other day that i thought was kind of interesting was that uh , uh , their version or vision or whatever the united states , now , is somewhat changed in that we won , you know . 
uh , a legitimate player ,
i don't think we can really understand their attitude because there cultures are just so much different . 
but , uh , we are now a legitimate player you know we defeated , 
you know iran couldn't do it in seven years 
and we went in and did in seven days what iran couldn't do in seven years , you know . 
that kind of ups our stock in there just a little bit . 
it makes us more legitimate . 
so , now what they're saying is that , well , since we won whatever we say goes because it's , uh , a kind of a might make strike sort of attitude about it 
and , you know , we've got the power .
because they'd go in and they'd win something . 
you know 
well , i just , uh , 
i'm not interested in keeping big military over there and having to go and call the shots like you say . 
and i just would prefer that , i mean sometimes we've said we're not interested in what other countries do . 
and then other times we jump in and do things 
and while i'm glad that they , 
uh , i , 
it was important demilitarize that area because of all the build up armaments . 
i don't ,   .
i hope we don't try to keep , uh , in there and try to keep our fingers in the pot and try to ,
because we just don't want to send our people there and make them stay . 
that's the big thing , you know , 
we still got a little bit of the old , you know , vietnam , um , problem , you know , in the back of our minds . 
we're used to wars where you can get in do the job and get out . 
vietnam we never did get out , you know , never did get the job done because they were too  ham strung  .
uh , this thing 
told them to go do it and they did it . you know , 
i'm not sure , 
uh , the shiites of all people , you know , in the southern part of the country and also the kurds 
because these people evidently are , you know , being killed off by the thousands . 
and whether the united nations , 
i don't think the u . s . will do it on their own 
but whether the united nations comes around and says , hey , wait a minute we know this thing isn't , uh , all that much over , we've got to go back in there and be sure that this large population isn't just wiped out . 
seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment . 
i noticed that . 
but , um , you know , 
well , i don't think there's much hope for a lasting peace over there like they ,
there never will be . 
i mean , uh , uh , the only way that you're going to have peace over there , if we determine that we want to go in and wipe out every last one of them , 
you know , until we make a decision to do that there won't be peace but i don't think we want to make that decision either . 
so that's a little rough , you know , 
we're not quite up to that sort of thing . 
well , i guess i better go 
i have a repairman just came ,
oh , well , that's , 
well , i enjoyed the topic . 
i hope you have a good day . 
you too . 
i love to do , uh , all kinds of crafts and sewing , 
i find that's my one release  , 
um , i like to do like physical things like sports . 
um , i really enjoy softball 
and my favorite is volleyball , 
but , i'm at school , 
i'm in , you know , 
i live up at the college ,
so i just , like sometimes , 
i like , just to get away , 
i go to my room and i like walk in , turn the radio on , or , you know , just kind of like veg out or something . 
well i have two small kids 
to go places and play sports , you know , 
i have to do something where i can do it at home . 
so , uh , i just love to sew 
and , uh , you know , i make a lot of my christmas presents , 
and i love to do all kinds of crafts and stuff like that . 
i like to do that stuff , but like when i'm at school , i don't have time to do it or even time to learn how to do it . 
i remember when i was in college , 
i didn't have time to do that stuff either . 
it was really , 
but you know , i don't have a whole lot of time now but i have more time than i did , 
and a lot of my sewing i kind of do out of necessity , you know , 
you know , i've got two kids to put clothes on , 
like , um , i come from a family of twelve children , 
and when i'm up here , i really miss my younger brothers and sisters , 
so you know , that's a change , because there's nine of them that are younger than me . 
  like when i know my mom and dad aren't home , i'll call home just to talk to my little brothers and sisters . 
i really miss them a lot 
so i don't , 
i guess talking on the phone is one of my hobbies too . 
i just , uh , have , you know , one brother and he's married , 
and , you know , they have a couple kids , 
so uh , you know , i don't get on the phone too much . 
most of my stuff is just going pla , 
you know i enjoy going places with my kids 
and i do like sports , but you know , i don't have a lot of time for them . 
i like volleyball . 
of all sports , i think that would be my favorite , because i hate basketball 
well , i'm not much of a basketball fan either . 
i enjoy playing volleyball but i don't have a lot of time to do it , 
it's maybe once a year or something 
and then i , you know , used to play it a lot when i was in school , 
but now that i'm married and stuff like , i'm really bad . 
nobody would want me on their team . 
so to speak , 
but , yeah , 
i enjoy , um , you know , just , 
you know , i have varied interests and stuff 
and yeah , 
um , not that i like reading , but i do do a lot of reading while i'm here at school . 
do you like reading as a hobby ? 
as far as fun reading , you know , i maybe get to read the sunday paper , but , that's about it , you know , 
i don't have a lot of time to read . 
yeah , i remember in college , i did a lot of reading , most of it text books , 
and , just , 
you know keeping busy with everything else going on , 
so . but yeah , 
i like to do , uh , 
i've made stuffed cows , you know , dress , you know , dolls , 
they're like dolls , 
you know , you make clothes for them and everything like that . 
those have been real popular with my family . 
if i had more time , i'd probably do it and sell the stuff 
but , you know , i don't have enough time to do it to really , you know , take orders on it , 
you know , it's like i can only do it when i have time . 
i have a whole stack of material and patterns to sew up as it is , 
do you , um , 
i know one thing that's pretty popular with the girls up here at college , and i make them also , is the padded covered photo albums ? 
oh yeah , 
i've done those too , before , 
those are real , 
several of those that i've made like as wedding gifts , you know . 
i made them out of all lace and satin , you know , and made them as wedding gifts and stuff like that , 
those are real popular , 
in fact , i got some of those for my wedding , 
i know they're real popular here at school , also . 
those are fun to do , 
and just little things , you know , 
i didn't have a lot of , 
when i was in college you know , 
like if somebody needed a bridesmaids , maids dress made , i'd make that , 
but that's about all the sewing i did , 
i never had time you know , to sew myself a new dress or anything like that 
but , yeah . 
i just kind of sew for my kids 
and that's about it , 
i'm not too much , uh , you know , 
i don't have a lot of hobbies , 
mine are just mostly , you know things i just do out of necessity . 
well , it's been nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you too . 
good luck in school . 
bye , bye .
do you do garden work ? 
i'm a college student 
 so if i do any garden work , it's only when i go home in the summer . 
oh , where do you go to college ? 
where's that ? 
it's about two hours north of pittsburgh . 
oh , okay . 
well , you know , do you do gardening at home ? 
well , we have a large family , 
there's twelve kids in my family . 
oh my goodness . 
so , like almost all our vegetables and everything is from the garden . 
so we have a pretty good size garden .
well i guess you glad you got to go to college so you'd get some rest 
 but we have like a lot , 
like my mom likes flowers , so we have a lot of flowers too . 
i had a whole bunch of flowers and things . 
well , i don't have as many now . 
we lived in the country 
and i had a whole bunch . 
but now , i work and i live in the city so , that sort a kind of hung it up . 
i have a few flowers , but most of mine are like in barrels and things like that . 
and this year i decided that , 
well my husband made a little garden out there with some tomatoes and stuff in it , 
but i decided that i don't like grass , 
i don't like to have to have to pull grass 
 so i decided that i would plant me a tomato plant in a flower pot 
you know , i've seen a lot of people that do that . 
i've seen , you know , like elderly people 
like we , 
i have a great aunt that lives in a , 
it's just like , uh , a high rise for elderly people . 
and , you know , she does her own thing and everything , 
but she has , 
it's like a little apartment building . 
and she has a tomato plant year round . 
because she , you know , 
they keep it warm for all the older people , 
and she keeps it year round . 
i had never thought about that . 
i could probably plant one and bring it in , just like i bring my plants in every year . 
that'd be neat . 
well , i got a patio , 
and i tried to talk my husband into just buying a whole bunch of pots .
he was going to plant in the earth , you know , like he always has , 
because he's always had a garden out in the country . 
and i think he kind of misses it a little bit , you know , since we moved to the city . 
but , um , i went ahead and planted one , and mine looks better than his .
it does , 
and then i like , um , 
you know what day lilies are ? 
pardon me ? 
are they , well , 
do they just come out in the morning then go 
   but we call them morning glories up here . 
these look like a lily . 
well , they really look like an orchid when they come out . 
oh really . 
that what the look like , 
but they only bloom for one day . 
they'll , um , 
you'll have a bud the evening before , 
and then the next morning as soon as the sun hits it , it starts opening up 
and then when it gets dark , it closes 
and that's it . 
it only blooms for one day . 
and then it's done , completely done . 
but , um , they look like orchids , is what they look like , 
but they look like different color ones , 
like i have , uh , yellow ones , 
and i have red ones , 
and then they have like , you know , the real velvety looking stuff inside 
oh , yeah . 
it looks just like orchids in different colors . 
that's what they look like . 
oh ,   really pretty . 
they're beautiful . 
uh , i have a friend when i lived out in the country , 
and she had belonged to this kind of society that like every year , you know , or every so many months they would send you different bulbs that they came out with . 
and i mean they were real expensive . 
they were like , well , 
the most expensive one that she gave me a bulb for was like thirtytwo fifty for one bulb . 
oh , my gosh . 
so what she would do is she would plant them , and they multiplied . 
so the next year when she , you know , weeded them out 
and , i mean , i have some of the most beautiful day lilies that you've ever seen . 
so , when we decided to move , it was really funny because , like i said , i had a whole bunch of different kinds of things , 
can we leave the grass ? 
   take the whole grass , the whole yard . 
you know , i mean , every time we went outside , he'd look at something that was humongous , you know , 
we're not taking that . 
i think we will leave that . 
 that'd be funny . 
but , i brought , 
my kids , when they were little they had given me some azaleas 
and you know , i brought as much as i could bring 
but , just like , um , you know , 
the people that um , i knew that they would , you know , 
if i left like one bulb of each one of them , by this year they'd have ten bulbs of each one of them . 
so , it wasn't like it was going to be this big raw place or something , you know , 
it would cover it right up . 
but , i just couldn't see it , you know , going off and leaving everything like that . 
because this house , i really liked it and everything , but the yard was a lot to be desired . 
these people , 
we have one ugly pine tree . 
i mean , and it is ugly . 
i even tried making it look nicer , you know , 
i tied the yellow ribbon around it , 
and it was so ugly . 
oh , it did not help , let me tell you . 
i took it off and put it on my door . 
i did not want to call attention . 
 i mean , it was terrible . 
so really the plants that i brought over and put out here are just about all . 
i don't do any of the mowing or , you know , edging and all that 
my husband does all that stuff . 
but that's because i'm allergic to the grass . 
oh , that'd be awful . 
i love going out in the summer in the grass . 
now i like to go to the beach where the sand is , 
because then it doesn't make me ill .
and , um , well even up here at school , you know , it gets hot , and we have the windows open , 
well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning . 
and just to smell the grass , it's just , 
i just love the smell of freshly cut grass . 
i used to until i got so allergic to it . 
i don't know if it's all , well , 
i went and had some tests run and just about all the kinds i was allergic to . 
but it's not as bad here , 
like saint augustine , i think , is what we have . 
and it's not as bad as it was when we were out in the country . 
but out in the country , i mean , 
if i went outside while he was mowing the grass , i was going to have a gigantic attack . 
oh my gosh . 
so , um , i get shots for it now , too . 
that helps a whole bunch . 
but , one good thing about it , see i don't have to mow the grass 
i mean , that's really nice . 
you said that you had a garden . 
what all things do you plant in it , 
well , the first thing we always plant is tomatoes 
every year . 
i don't care if we don't have anything else , 
we're going to have tomatoes . 
and then we plant cucumbers 
do your cucumbers come good ? 
oh yeah . 
sometimes when my dad has , like , 
that's the one thing no one is allowed to touch except my dad . 
he takes care of all the cucumbers , 
because he said the vines are just so , 
at our house , as soon as you touch a vine , it's like it completely dies . 
it must be the , uh , 
sometimes we have really good luck with them , 
but then there'll be like maybe two years in a row that we can't get anything . 
now i mean , that's something that grows like a weed here . 
oh , wow . 
we have to allow extra room for those , you know , i mean extra space ,
because they take up a lot . 
but i mean , we usually get , 
holy smoke . 
we usually give them to everybody . 
anybody that wants a cucumber can have it . 
but we tried it , too , where you run it up a fence 
 and , um , we had some weird cucumbers because they grew inside the fence . 
i mean like the little thing would be half on one side and half on the other . 
oh my gosh . 
i mean , it was , 
but they're so heavy , you know , 
they get so heavy they kind of weigh it down . 
but , i mean , cucumbers here grow like crazy . 
of course it's real hot here too . 
well , see , tomatoes grow like crazy at our house . 
like we have a section of tomatoes , 
and we put the tomatoes there every year , in the same section . 
and i swear we get tomatoes six rows up . 
now if we have any , like the birds will pick or something , you know , 
and some of the seeds drop . 
have you ever had them just come up in different places ? 
i know , we do that , too , you know , 
and at the first year , 
because i was from the city when we got married , 
and the first year that we planted , i couldn't figure out , i mean , the , 
well , the first year after 
but the first year , you know , after we'd had a crop 
we had cucumbers coming up , you know , in the middle of our okra , 
and i thought , how did this get here 
i know i didn't put that seed there . 
and it was weird , but the birds had , you know , evidently just deposited them for us . 
well , sometimes , too , when we take out our garbage , 
and you know , we just dump it in the middle of the garden , you know , after your garden's basically done 
 and we're finding out , 
like we have peach trees in the middle of our garden now , because we took peach seeds and dump them there , whenever the garden , 
like in the fall , 
now we have peach trees coming up , 
do you want to start out ? 
well , it'll be real easy for us , 
because my husband and i are vegetarians . 
oh , are you really ? 
so , yeah . 
are you strict vegetarians ? 
we're ovolacto . 
we do eat , uh , eggs and milk products . 
i used to be a complete vegan vegetarian ,
but , um , it's really difficult in the area if you don't have , you know , the products that you can get . 
and if you go out to dinner , you know , there's not a whole lot of things you can get . 
there's very few places i'll bet that you could , uh , 
i think maybe if you were somewhere like california , where they have a lot more vegetarian restaurants 
but here , basically , you go to an italian restaurant or you go to a mexican restaurant ,
and you 
and some . 
you have to watch that too . 
you know , some of the restaurants here they will , you know , l , 
you can ask them and they'll tell you whether or not they use like lard or ,
so , but , so that 
we don't really eat out too much . 
we tend to eat at home . 
and actually , you know , i think we have a healthier diet than the average person . 
how long have you been doing this ? 
um , i've been a vegetarian for , uh , two years now . 
my husband has been one for , oh , just over a year now . 
and , uh , so , 
do you feel that it has improved the way you feel ? 
do you think ? 
and it makes you more aware of what you're eating . 
because you have to be . 
i mean , you k , 
i think you balance the foods , uh , you know , 
you're more aware of what nutrient , you know , value each thing has ,
and you're just more aware of food for energy , 
i always thought it would be hard to figure what to eat if you were a vegetarian . 
well , that's just it , 
you do have to figure it out .
and when i was a vegan , it's , you know , 
you have to consider calcium and iron and 
your egg products .
because you don't eat any of those things . 
but actually you can get everything you need through vegetables . 
i mean , there are , 
you actually you can get more calcium through leafy green vegetables than you can get through milk products . 
is that right ? 
a lot of people don't know that . 
well , the thing is that milk products , 
our bodies uh , don't , uh , 
the lactose , 
that kind of milk , it doesn't , 
we tend to , uh , 
what's it called ? 
we don't synthesize the calcium the 
we throw more of it off 
we slough some of it , 
our body doesn't accept some of it . 
so we're , 
it gets rid of some of the calcium .
you utili , 
your body accepts 
all that's in it . 
so , it's like , 
your body just doesn't accept vitamins 
 you know . so , 
that's interesting . 
but we both feel much healthier ,
and i couldn't consider going back to eating , 
after you have been on this . 
well , now i changed for ethical reasons . 
and my husband has changed . 
he feels more ethically about it . 
but he in the beginning , began for health reasons . 
but , um , now he feels like i do . 
he looks at the things that he eats 
and he realizes what they are 
and he ,
he thinks more about them , then . 
plus he eats , 
i thought more of about it as far as what it was i was eating , you know , 
and now we both think a lot of well , what is it we're eating in relation to what it's going to give to our bodies . 
so you kind of have a combination . 
well see , i live in a farming community .
well , we do too . 
i mean , i was raised in , um , 
we're in cattle country . 
and people here buy a half a cow 
 oh , yeah , 
 you know . and that's the way i , 
and i , 
believe you me it wasn't easy to give up  , 
was a good steak or a hamburger . 
but , you know , i suppose if you really believe in something 
you get adjusted to the taste . 
 because your mind . 
inside yourself it's not right . 
but , um , 
so you would have a little more trouble when you were looking for a dining area than what most 
now we wouldn't have that problem , because we're not vegetarians . 
so what do you look for when you , 
uh , i think the main thing that i look for is , uh , cleanliness , uh , you know , in the appearance of the people that work there .
oh , we try new places 
but when we , 
a lot of times we do eat where we know . 
what the quality , 
because a lot of them are the same no matter where you stop . 
and , uh , we do , do that a lot . 
and i guess i'm getting older , 
i like to sit down and have my , uh , order taken . 
as opposed to like a cafeteria 
so , i suppose you'd say i , 
well i don't know whether it's age or what it is . 
but i have , 
well no , 
i don't think so . 
i think it's just your , 
because i prefer to be waited on too . 
i just , 
if you're going to go out to eat , why not have the whole service ,
why not get the whole , 
i guess because we don't go out that much , 
i feel like it's a treat . 
you should have a treat . 
and i like the light meals . 
not all restaurants have light meals on their menu ,
and i , 
light menu , you mean like cooked light or , 
uh , l i t e , like , uh , uh , things that aren't as heavy a meal . 
oh , i see . 
 you get more , uh , fruit and maybe cottage cheese or a chicken breast or things that aren't as , uh , 
they're not breaded 
and they're not fried 
and they're not , 
not a lot of gravy 
uh , but it's not 
you know , i , 
i like those too , because , uh , you order a meal , you order their dinner meal , and it's like they're trying to find out how much you can eat . 
i know 
 or  , 
it's too much , 
or like evidently people go in there and they're not satisfied that they'd been given enough and they complain 
i don't know what it is . 
but , now for instance , we had a scout dinner last night we went to . 
and it's 
uh , well they'll serve you at your seat 
and usually the salad bar is included , 
so you have to get up for that . 
but they have so much food that not matter how hard you try to restrain yourself , you end up eating much more than you need . 
and i think that's a shame . 
i mean , i must admit , sometimes i do like a buffet . 
you say , oh , well , i've have got all i can eat 
 or , you know , it's one of these situations where nobody's going to restrain what you eat ,
and i think that we just tend to eat , overeat . 
you can eat 
uh , a lot of times the foods , 
like , uh ,  haas's  carry a bread bar that is just out of this world .
and , you know , 
and soup 
and , uh , they just , 
and fruit and vegetables 
and they just , 
i don't know . 
i know i always overeat no matter . 
i go with good intentions , 
 but i , 
somehow along the way , when i come back to my seat , i have too much . 
and i eat it because it's so good . 
well at least it's fruit and stuff there .
maybe it's not too bad . 
and i like reasonable prices of course , too . 
i don't like to , you know , go to anything that's real expensive . 
i think that's a waste of my money . 
just for food ,
but , uh , 
uh , we do like international food , 
so we take , 
do you ? 
i like cu , 
we like indian food , 
 and , uh , i love italian food , 
 and , uh , 
chinese ? 
we've got a good chinese restaurant in town . 
i really like eating there 
and you don't get stuffed on their food it seems . 
you know , you can eat a whole big plate of their food , and you really don't feel like you've eaten too much . 
you're full , you know , 
you're satisfied , 
 but you don't feel stuffed and miserable . 
that's one thing that i wish we had more of , uh . 
because where we're from , it's pretty limited , 
and it's , 
most of the restaurants oh , they tend to be , you know , american style food . 
and we don't have too many , w , 
you have to go all the way to dallas . 
and so it really is a treat , 
 uh , yeah . 
 because , uh , 
 you know , we don't make a you know , sixtyfive to eighty miles . depending how far in dallas it is . 
so what movies have you seen ? 
uh , well , i have , uh , seen dances with wolves , which is probably the best movie that i have seen lately . 
uh , i do not go out to films very often .
so we do get a lot of videos that we bring in , 
uh , and i see some that way . 
but , uh , i am not real current on films . 
how about you ? 
i saw dances with wolves and , uh , home alone 
i hear that is really good , but i have not seen it yet . 
it is . 
it is about a little kid that his parents go off to paris . 
and they forget all about him . 
they take a head count and the oldest daughter counts one of the neighbor kids instead of , 
oh , cute . 
and he is up in the attic asleep because he got in trouble . 
oh , dear . 
so she made him go sleep upstairs . 
and there is , 
and , uh , 
oh , and he hears them or something 
and he sets up traps for them all over the house . 
who wins ? 
uh , he does . 
oh , great , 
i had heard people talk about it , 
and they say it was really cute , but i had not seen it . 
uh , we usually wait 
and eventually it comes out on video , 
and then we get it and see it that way . 
and that is , it , 
movies are very expensive . 
uh , movie theatres here , they are six dollars , uh , for evening performances . 
and that is kind of steep , 
i think . 
i don't know . 
how much is it in dallas ? 
well , it is six dollars , 
but you get , um , matinee prices . 
you can do that , but it is difficult if you , if you work or , you know , 
uh , that is taking the middle of the afternoon . 
and if i am looking for entertainment usually i , have more , uh , time in the evening than i do in the middle of the day to , uh , see things . 
what do you think of movies in general ? 
as far as the trends ? 
well , i think they are a lot better than they were , 
well , like , um , in the early eighties or like the smokey and the bandit era . 
when it was , 
i do not think they were very good during that time . 
at least 
the quality i think maybe has improved in that respect . 
uh , the only thing that disturbs me is that now they think they have to add just a little bit of sex and violence in order to get that , you know , it will be more enticing to the , to the public . 
and a lot of times it is added for no real , uh , valid reason . 
uh , which does not make , 
and i think smokey and the bandit was a little bit like that . 
uh , but dances with wolves did not seem to have anything added . 
it was just all legitimate kind of , uh , film . 
and that is where reason why i suppose it won so many oscars , uh , 
because it really was good even though it is such a long movie . 
and it was shocking at the end too . 
oh , oh , yeah . 
uh , but much more true to life 
and i think that is the point . 
that is right . 
uh , they do not have to keep making up stuff if they want to make something good . 
i hate sequels too . 
i hate these , uh , you know , number one , two , three , four . 
usually if a movie is good , once is enough .
especially jaws . 
that was on prime time television here , uh , recently at seven thirty in the evening . 
and , uh , it was kind of shocking because that is a scary movie . and children , young children could have seen that movie ,
and i thought , you know , that would not have been the sort of thing i would have wanted my children to see at that age , uh , i mean when they were young . 
and here it was quite easily seen by anybody that turned on the t v . 
uh , which was a , 
it was a good movie . 
i mean it was well done but , uh , that is one reason why it was scary . 
so , but i do not know that i have seen any of the , uh , sequels to that . 
i think one is enough . 
just more of the same . 
that is what people say . 
in one of them they have a mother shark , uh , destroy a whole , uh , marina and aquarium .
just a touch . 
well , the whole movie is kind of far fetched . 
but , i mean the whole idea behind it is far fetched . 
they hardly ever play music when a shark attacks somebody . 
not too often .
that has gotten to be a whole camp idea now though , you know . 
if you hear that music , you know , everybody knows what you are talking about . 
it's funny . 
well , it sounds like neither one of us are real movie buffs . 
well , uh , every once in a while , i go , but it has to be like somebody that i like 
you know . i did not go see field of dreams when it was in the theatre because i did not know it was any good . 
and then i found out it was kevin costner when it was on , um , i guess a b c the other week , 
then i , 
and then i really liked it . 
it was good . 
it was very good . 
but , uh , um , uh , see i have , uh , teenagers in my house . 
and of course sometimes they rent movies and , you know , have friends over or something . 
and sometimes movies are here that i am not even aware that i could have seen , you know . 
because my family tells me that it had been actually in the house before .
but i had missed it . 
but i did see it on t v , 
and i thought it was good . 
it was really , 
and then , and then , uh , shoeless joe jackson really was a player . 
i thought they made him up , and then i found out , you know , after i saw the movie that , they started talking about that scandal 
oh , really ? 
that was around the time of anniversary , you know . 
no kidding . 
and then 
oh , i did not realize that . 
uh , you know , the character that , uh , james earle jones played ? 
uh , uh , i teach in school , 
and we are doing a book called invisible man by ralph ellison . 
and i wondered if maybe he was patterned after him . 
uh , i do not know , 
i had not heard anybody talk about it . 
but , uh , he certainly could have been . uh , which was kind of interesting . 
so , uh , it was kind of fun . 
and i wondered who it was too . 
i do not know for sure , 
but there are certain , uh , qualities that suggest it could be he . 
because uh , they were suggesting that this ben was something of a recluse . 
that he had stopped writing and had stopped , you know , 
and that is true for ellison . 
he wrote that one book and a few essays and that is about it .
but he is still alive 
and you know , that is what makes it so interesting . 
and that book , have you ever read that book ?
uh , i d , 
what is that ? 
invisible man ? 
invisible man by ralph ellison . 
uh , no . 
it is an incredible book . 
it , uh , really is very interesting . 
i highly recommend it . 
uh , did they make the movies after that 
uh , the , 
the movie , 
field of dreams came out after , uh , that novel . 
so it could easily have been patterned after him . 
but with the story that i am talking about . 
i just thought the , uh , author could have been patterned after that , uh , 
i mean that character could have been patterned after him or someone like him , certainly . 
sort of interesting , 
oh , yeah . 
it was n , 
very good . 
it was nice talking to you . 
are you in the market for a car recently ? 
oh , what did you get ? 
i got a nineteen ninetythree cavalier station wagon . 
what convinced you to get that one ? 
well , a friend of my father's , he'd driven it all over the country 
oh , incredible , 
how many miles on it ? 
like , it has a hundred and fiftythree thousand . 
and it's still running real well . 
oh , great , 
uh , right now we have two cars , uh , 
i have , my husband and myself and we have two sons who are drivers 
and then we have , um , 
about a year ago , we picked up a second hand , uh , uh , audi 
 and , uh , that was you know , a sedan , 
and , uh , we got that .   
the major things , 
the reason why we got that is we had had a nova , 
and a , 
my son was driving , 
and someone came into his lane and hit him , 
and fortunately he was able to , 
i mean he was out of the hospital by that night , but the car was completely totalled 
 and my two sons had been a passenger in a car about a year and a half before that , which was hit by another car . 
so i mean , i was getting really nervous , 
so i finally said , i want a really solid car . 
so we found the audi second hand . 
i guess right now my criteria for cars is , uh , being solid , able to take an impact 
 and , uh , so , uh , in the near future for any new car . 
but the things that i would want would be a solid car . 
another thing i'd definitely want would be antilock brakes . 
uh , a delight to drive , does not have , 
i think the brakes on the plymouth van are terrible . 
if the road is at all wet , and i'm , 
and i don't go all that fast , but it just doesn't hold . 
it doesn't hold well at all . 
so , i definitely want to get anti lock brakes . 
so , i don't know , 
do you have any particular things that are priorities on your list . 
well , it's , 
i didn't really need power windows , but it has power , you know , windows 
and uh . 
oh , yeah . 
 and , um , he's told me it gets fortytwo miles to the gallon . 
that's incredible . 
uh , on highways , can get about twentyeight . 
the audi does not have good mileage . 
that's the one drawback . 
it's a powerful car .
i mean , i'm lucky . 
maybe sometimes i've gotten twentytwo . 
it comes out around the eighteen or nineteen local driving 
 and that's to me is a real drawback . 
i wish you know , i could settle for twentyeight , 
but , uh , uh , the frills on that car are nice , but they're not necessary , for me 
uh , in washington d c area , it gets hot and humid . 
it's really humid . 
uh , so air conditioning is uh , definitely a necessity for us through two or three months in the summer . 
um , but i don't need , uh , you know , 
power windows are nice , but i don't need them .
it's real nice for that window to zip down and zip up , instead of having to crank it . 
or , you know , if you want to have open windows , to be able to op , 
if you're alone in the car 
you don't have to stretch . 
but you know , i've lived all these years without them , 
i probably could have lived a little longer .
that's true . 
uh , one of the things that this used car has it , is a sun roof 
 and those are really nice in good weather . 
that's right . 
anti lock brakes , 
i'd love to get an air bag 
i guess that those are my major criteria . 
everything else is , you know , a luxury , 
and they ,
so , uh , if you were to buy a brand new car , what would you look for ? 
um , like you said , antilock brakes and air bag , 
and , uh , i'd really like to have a car that's dependable 
isn't that true . 
it's funny , um , uh , that you use , 
the audi's german , and i have to say , it has been pretty dependable . 
sometimes , one advantage of an american made car , is if you get stuck anywhere , most local garages can fix you up . 
they have parts , 
but once you get something fancy , you get stuck somewhere off of the main area 
and i know the audi parts are terribly expensive . 
i mean , it jus , 
i shudder . 
i would not get the audi again , just for that reason . 
but i would love , i wish that , you know , engineering would make something as solid as a german car . 
you know , we 
but , it's amazing , 
when we bought this audi , 
i mean , everything is more solid in it . 
uh , if , 
you don't feel you've got any of the flabby plastic 
 and i know , 
and and i'm willing to give up a little bit in the mileage for a solid car . 
i don't think i have to give up as much as i'm giving up . 
but , do you need air conditioning down there ? 
 because even today it's supposed to get up into the nineties . 
oh , we've had eleven days in a row over ninety . 
they've in fact had to excuse school down here because of that . 
well , listen , 
i enjoyed talking with you . 
and enjoy your car . 
have a nice summer . 
thank you , 
you too , 
it's going to be a hot one . 
do you have any ? 
i'm trying to think offhand 
i have one , 
  and it's a real pet peeve of mine . 
it seems i do work during the day 
and when i'm home , uh , you know i'm either cooking or running doing ,
and i hate when the phone rings and it turns out to be a telephone salesman . 
and it's real , 
the two pet peeves that , 
number one , i really feel that that's you know , my own home . 
and i ha , 
and if i want something , i will get it . 
i will go out and get it myself . 
and i never buy anything from a telephone ,
oh , i wouldn't ,
so , i really feel they're invading my time and my space 
and i , 
it really bothers me . 
um , it's a little bit like junk mail except you can't , you know , ignore it , uh , quite as easily . 
and i try to be polite , 
but at the same point , 
that doesn't always work . 
well , i just say thank you very much for calling but i'm not interested , 
and then i hang up before they can say anything . 
oh , really ? 
because you don't hear , you know how , 
they can say anything they want 
it's just , 
but i just feel that's my thing on invasion of privacy . 
and , um , uh , i sort of have a sort like 
you can prevent yourself from getting junk mail by getting yourself off of mailing lists . 
i wish that there were a way that you could , um , you know , submit your telephone number to the phone company and have a penalty for anyone who calls you to sell things ,
well , how do you get your name off the junk mailing list ? 
uh , you do that by , uh , um , 
the postal service has some information which you fill out and they send , 
it's for every company , 
i mean you can't do it for any compan , 
you know , but you can then send it 
and they can pro , 
they tell , 
that company is not allowed to sent you any junk mail . 
oh , really ? 
if you get junk mail on a regular basis from any particular company you can , 
oh , i didn't even know that . 
you have to go to the post office and ask them for the form that you fill out not to get , you know , junk mail from specific companies . 
oh , wow . 
and i wish there were something like that where you can call the telephone company 
 and you could your number put in a registry . 
and then anyone making these calls have to check that registry for that area 
so that would be one way of doing it . 
i can't really think of anything that invades my privacy , 
but one of my pet peeves , you came up with the telephone is , when you have an answering machine and they hang up before they leave a message . 
i can't stand that . 
i think that is so stupid , you know , 
oh , i'm guilty of that sometimes 
because i've called and there really wasn't any significant message 
and i wasn't going to be available to be called back . 
and it was sort of like , oh , the hell , 
i'm not going to spend the time giving , 
and , uh , i'll call later ,
the other thing you use your credit card and then they ask for a telephone number . 
well , legally now they're not allowed , 
they're n , 
you do not have to give a telephone number . 
oh , really ? 
and i don't really like announcing in public 
 you know , when you're sitting there , 
my telephone and i don't like the way telephone numbers can be used . 
we once had a situation where someone was using a credit card number of ours and he actually had our phone number , 
but it turned out  it had to have been  my husband's office phone number . 
and , uh , to  discard  the charges . 
um , but it was , 
i don't like how they a , 
i realize that this is your identification 
but i worked with someone that got hold of his ,
same with my husband . 
it was the charge card and social security number . 
and , you know , ever get anything over the phone because i don't want to give my social security number out . 
well , you should never give the social security number . 
uh , sometimes , if you charge , 
sometimes i charge theater tickets 
and then , you know , because they pick them up at the box office we'll call . 
but , um , that's the only thing i would ever have ever used it for the phone 
and that was because i initiated it . 
uh , and occasionally i do order things from catalogs 
but again i initiate it not the company . 
the other thing is though you do not have to , 
if you're buying something in a store and you pay for it by charge and they ask you for your telephone number , you do not have to give it . 
that's a law that went into effect , i don't know a year or two ago . 
oh , i never even knew that . 
and , uh , you can just say uh , i'm not required to give that by law 
and then they won't , 
a lot of stores will still ask . 
but , uh , the credit card company , you know , accepts the charges . 
i mean it , 
a rea , 
the credit cards company's responsibility . 
well , is there any ,
so wha ,  in this   , 
oh , okay . 
and i guess , uh , that's probably my biggest one in terms of invasion of privacy . for people outside the family , of course , 
i've got little pet peeves , you know , with my family . 
 you know . but of course , th , 
i guess that just comes uh , with the territory with a family that 
 does a mother can do  some privacy . 
 i really ,
but , uh , 
nothing that you felt that , you know , 
any experiences you've had at work ? 
i , you know , othe , 
i really can't say anything that would really bother me . 
so many things i think over the years have been , um , accepted , i mean uh , that are no longer done . 
i mean i can remember when i was very young , much younger and i applied for a job 
well , i mean , that's none of their business . 
but of course , now by law they  can't  ask that . 
so i mean there has been i think a lot done to protect privacy . 
especially between women and , 
how do you feel , 
they've gotten a lot with , uh , 
applications and stuff and aren't allowed to ask . 
that's right . 
i think it's for the better of like i , 
you mean like for working and stuff ? 
they're looking out for everyone . 
they're not , 
you know , i think it's more safety than anything else . 
i feel that way too . 
i sometimes feel you know , sometimes individual rights including the right to privacy have to be sacrificed for a greater benefit . 
because i know , 
you know , for example airline pilots . 
i mean i do want my pilot to be sober .
because i know , 
i worked at a still mill in this summer . 
and i know ,
and it's dangerous . 
i don't even like having them around . 
i kind of do their work for them because they make it more hazardous than what it is without them , you know . 
that's right . 
i know i , 
you know , i think some of the people that oppose , you know , mandatory drug testing for certain areas say , well , it's not , 
i forgot 
do you have any children ? 
i just graduated from college . 
oh , did you ? 
where did you go ? 
i went to clarion . 
huh , uh , i mean , if you had children , would you want them to go to a certain place 
um , i would want them to make that decision 
and i would , you know , 
uh , i pretty much made my decision on my own and my older brother , likewise . 
and , uh , you know , we were both pretty much happy with what we did . 
so , i think , i would not push them towards any one place . 
i know , 
i kind of feel the same way 
i just finished college a couple years ago 
and i , uh , you know , 
it was while i had my family and everything and it was a lot harder , 
but , uh , you know , i went to a college that was fairly local 
and i feel like my education , you know , 
you get out of it what you put into it , i think . 
but , you know , i know , 
some people are real adamant about , you know , going to a certain school or whatever . 
i do not know , 
i guess a lot of it would depend on maybe what your major was or something , 
i do not know . 
i think one of the first things kids ought to look for is , first of all , they have to decide what they want to major in .
is that why you picked the school you did 
so you lived there at school then ? 
you lived there at school . 
uh , another reason was , uh , i paid for my entire education .
you know , and , uh , oh , it was roughly around six thousand a year . 
and that was for tuition 
that was for everything . 
and now , i did not go out a lot 
and i did not order out a lot , 
and you know , i did not spend money on myself . 
but , uh , then again , i was there for school 
uh , and then another reason was i was not sure , you know , 
i always wanted to go to school for nursing , and then at the last minute , i changed my mind . 
and i knew that clarion was known , you know ,   for two things , 
actually , for their , 
they are known as a teacher's school 
so , that's what i ended up going for is for business . 
for business . 
so , uh , are you working somewhere then 
i am moving shortly , 
so i am not looking around here . 
oh , i see , 
where are you going to move to ? 
uh , maryland . 
oh , are you ? 
do you have friends there 
my fiancee is down there .
oh , i see . 
so , does he work for a company down there ? 
oh , i see . 
oh , the big company . 
so , yeah , 
i have been working for t i for about twelve years , i guess . 
but i am originally from illinois , but , you know , i have gone to college , i guess a few different places , 
but i think , you know , what i have put into it . 
i think that's most of it personally , 
but that's why you know , with my kids , i think that , you know , i am just going to encourage them to go . 
and i am going to try to help them financially 
but , uh , i think , you know , financially , i am , 
there's only so much i can do for them , 
you can either , you know , go a couple of years locally and , you know , then if you want to move off to a more expensive school then , we might be able to handle it . but ,
i put my wife through school too . 
of course t i paid for a lot of the tuition and books and stuff , but , uh , it still was a challenge to do . 
that's one of the big aspects . 
you know , you , 
it does have a lot of bearing on it , whether you are paying for yourself ,
well , uh , since you were paid for school yourself , do you think you had a different outlook on it , like your grades and things like that ? 
uh , yeah , 
because i was paying for it myself , i kind of slacked off , 
because i felt it was mine and i could do with it what i wanted . 
i think if my parents would have paid for it they would have been on me , you know , 
uh , they pretty much got to the point , 
well , well , you know , you are at that age 
and you are going to have to decide what you want to do . 
if you goof ,
it's not ours , you know . 
and then , lets me go 
and , i mean , i did not do poorly . 
i finished with a two five , 
that's not that wonderful either . 
but , uh , you know , i mean i worked , 
i did not , you know , 
i worked . 
it was just harder , you know , 
  i do not know , 
i was used to being , you know , on top 
and when i started there , it was like , you are mediocre , 
well see , i think , you know , 
i have known a lot of people that would go to school and their parents paid for it 
and i guess it depends on the way you are raised too , 
but if you grow to expect that , you know , 
that's the way a lot of my friends did it 
and , you know , they did not take it very serious . 
i know i took it real serious , 
'cause i did not start to college until , you know , i was about eight or ten years uh , you know , out of what i should have been in school . 
uh , you know , so i think that helped me be real serious about it . 
and i ended up graduating with like a three point six . 
oh , wow , 
that's really good . 
so i , you know , 
and that was hard cause i had two kids ,
so i had a lot of different hats to wear all at the same time . 
see , well i screwed myself up also , 
there was a point in time that i decided that i did not want to in school , 
and my parents never pushed me until my dad just said , what are you going to do 
you are right , 
so , i went and i just took business , 
well , being as i was paying for it myself , you know , i just kept , 
you do not get into your major until like your second or third year . 
and i am going into my third year 
and i decided , well i do not want to do accounting anymore , 
 and i thought , oh , my god , i am paying for this myself , 
i am not switching completely because ,
so i switched to finance , 
and i liked it better 
and i pulled myself from a two oh to a two five , you know , 
but i would have really liked to go on , uh , secondary ed with math education , 
but it was just the fact i was paying for it myself , 
i was not going ,
well my wife , was sort of in the same situation , 
she went to school to be a teacher just because she did not really know what else to go ,
and she did not realize until she got to be a senior and was doing her student teaching that she did not like it . 
but , you know , by then she had practically got her degree , 
so , you know , 
if , uh , i would have went with the math , i think i would have done a lot better , because i was more interested . 
and i knew that's what i wanted . 
but , uh , i think a lot of kids that hold off a year or two , 
i would like to see the results on a study done . 
i think they would do a lot better . because they are more focused . 
they know exactly what they want to do . 
i think you are right , 
what is your opinion ? 
i say yes . 
you say yes . 
mother lives in florida , 
and in her subdivision there are fifty percent canadians who won't give up their canadian citizenship because of the health insurance . 
i have heard someone else , uh , say that , uh , the canadian health insurance is absolutely excellent 
it's wonderful . 
 and one of the ways that they're financing it is they have an exorbitant tax on their cigarettes . 
this is 
well , even if that's 
so , you know , really when you look at it , they have full coverage , 
they have h m o , which , you know , after you get used to it , it's not too bad , 
and , uh , everything is covered 
 and we have so many people in the united states that we spend , 
well , in my family alone , we spent four thousand dollars in july on medical bills 
oh , my word , lynn . 
insurance didn't cover a penny . 
that's horrible . 
well , we're fortunate in that real healthy 
 so we don't have a lot of medical bills . 
uh , if you're healthy it's fine , 
but i had two kids in the hospital in july . 
but what worries me is the fact that i don't like the government telling me who i can see and who i can't see . 
but , you know , richardson school district has the h m o 
 and ninety percent of the doctors you would choose are on that list . 
are they ? 
well , i know that james had it . 
mccullum is . 
i beg your pardon . 
mccullum is . 
i know that when james was with continental steel , mccullum was part of that , 
and that's good . 
but i also heard , for instance , like , uh , my friend's daughter was on it through texas instruments , 
and she was on that kaiser permanente 
 and they had screwed up her appointment , 
and when she went in , she had to take whichever doctor was available , 
and they , 
she would have had to wait like two months to get the doctor she wanted . 
well , but that's 
but then again , i guess you can even do that in mccullum . 
i'm going back to the days when i was pregnant 
 and i had two doctors , 
and one was my favorite , personality wise 
 but when i delivered ronnie , he was not on call 
the other guy delivered him 
well , that's true , 
and that still goes on . 
 you know , and that , 
and , you know , if , um , i go to townsend 
he's got a new partner . 
i go to both of them now . 
you know , i have no choice 
well , you know , it , uh , 
how do you think we're going to pay for it ? 
more and more taxes ? .
well , no , 
i know that it's getting to the point that the insurance doesn't pay that much on catastrophic illnesses . 
they don't pay anything on , uh , implants 
and , you know , people are needing these , 
and the average person can't afford , you know , a heart or a kidney 
but you known , ronnie , in austin , went to a program and went to a social worker 
 and at the same token there is something , 
because he can get his pills for two dollars , when i'm paying fifteen on my medical insurance 
good grief . 
 and he can get free medical care , but he has to go to the city hospital instead of seeing david 
we went through ronnie's home tonight , 
you know , he pays fortyfive dollars a month for his prescriptions , where he could pay six dollars . 
so , there 
very true . 
well , i know they have the medicaid , you know , for those that have trouble , 
and i know that like we have the , uh , prescription cards which , 
that's helped bunches 
 and , wonder if the insurance companies are fighting the national health , 
or wonder if they're wanting it . 
that's what i read . 
that they are wanting , 
i've , uh , 
are you there ? 
yes , sir , 
all right .
okay , um , 
i'm in an area where , um , we can , uh , enjoy it year round , 
so , i've actually uh , uh , been out within the past couple of weeks . 
i'm mainly a freshwater fisherman . 
how about yourself ? 
well , actually i've done both kinds 
 uh , i'm originally from the state of virginia 
did you ev , 
there's a possibility , but that was so long ago 
i moved here to state college , uh , in nineteen fiftyfive 
 and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water 
 and we have a lot of , uh , beautiful fresh water streams that come through this area . 
i'm in an area called center county , which is in the very center of the state of pennsylvania , 
i've been in that area 
and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary . 
the trout fishing is really , uh , beautiful . 
as i say , the streams are , oh , eight , ten , fifteen feet wide and so forth , 
and , uh , you work , uh , from your feet most of the time 
for brookies . 
 and then there are a few lakes of course , close 
wherever the area , 
whatever uh , i enjoy fishing for it , 
and i try to , 
i haven't fished in several years 
do you fly fish , or are those streams too small ? 
 i used to do that a little when i lived up in new york , 
oh , that's a pretty big fish . 
uh , yeah , 
they've , uh , 
the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes , 
and they're pretty exciting when they're running . 
it's a salt water fish in fresh water , uh , environment . 
well , our streams here are replanted with fish about every year 
it's all put and take . 
and this is , of course , x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens 
what's the season ? 
april to october or something like that ? 
you know . 
what's a license cost ? 
well , as i say , it's been several years , 
but the licenses weren't that expensive , 
seems to stick in my mind , five to seven dollars 
it's about the same as texas . 
and i have , oh , probably a half a dozen different kinds of , uh , fishing poles and fly rods and so forth , 
and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish . 
but i'm going to be retiring at the end of december , 
and i hope , uh , the next fishing season , that i can sort of get back in and , uh , enjoy that . 
that was a really enjoyable , uh , thing for me to do . 
well , i have all sons , so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time .
huh , i just have one son and he lives out of the state now , rather , in the eastern corner of it , 
so , i don't think he has time to fish either .
i caught the disease from my father , 
and i'm passing it on to my children . 
it's really  , 
oh , is that right ? 
they love it , 
oh , my goodness . 
well , i was in the norfolk portsmouth area , 
there's so much water around 
 and , uh , i fairly enjoyed at that time . 
i have a small aluminum boat here 
when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here for trout from that , 
uh , uh , i don't know about the lakes in central pennsylvania . 
are there many ? 
 well , as i say , i'm in center county . 
um , there're two different size lakes about , well , five , six miles from state college . 
now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view 
 but they are probably fifteen , twenty acres maybe 
do you have to do a lot of upkeep ? 
we have a small backyard and small front yard 
 but , uh , uh , i do basically like the shrubbery and the planting and the weeding 
and he mows the lawn because the lawn mower is too heavy .
that's another story . 
 and , uh , i do the edging and stuff like that , 
but , uh , it doesn't take us that long because our yard is so small . 
but , uh , i try and do as much , you know flowering as i can , and 
but , uh , .
well , that's nice .
i wish i could say that . 
ours is pretty small , too , 
but it takes about an hour with the two of us working 
uh , the worst part is controlling the weeds .
oh , yeah . 
that's true . 
but we try not to use them but we end up using some anyway . 
uh  , um , what else . 
i get to put out all the christmas lights out there and all that ,
i don't .
oh , okay . 
well , if they go up 
like , one year we 
and i 
i decided i was afraid .
don't blame you .
so this year , he got lazy so i said , fine 
i'll put some on the bushes . 
and that's about it , 
that's all 
huh , okay , 
we don't have that many bushes to put them on . 
uh , our yard is very , uh , narrow 
 and so we have some bushes , but we don't have too many , 
but we have a nice tree in the front 
oh , wow . 
 and , uh , they keep hitting the tree with the lawn mower . 
oh , no . 
you know , every time you do that , it , uh , kind of kills the tree for a while . 
and so that's kind of stunt its growth for just a while until we get it back going again . 
and we started mowing our own lawn 
 because they were doing that . 
and so , anyways i have a nice full tree now 
   , we fill it with lights and 
and uh , they also edged , 
so we , 
oh , is it real expensive ? 
oh , gosh . 
it's like seventy a month . 
oh , my goodness . 
and i don't like , 
i just get really upset every time i make that check out . 
but , uh , 
well , do they do other things for you all ? 
they take care of the , uh , landscape , 
because we live in a culdesac 
and there is a island in the middle 
 so they care of that 
and there is a pool and they take care of the pool 
 and there is a pond , 
they take care of the pond in the park area and that kind of thing . 
uh , so you're basically paying , oh , 
and the sprinkler system that , 
our yard doesn't have a sprinkler system , but the island does 
and , uh 
and that's the bad thing . 
i just hope it doesn't go up any more 
i don't know what to do if you can't afford it .
i don't know either . 
that's interesting . 
so , uh , but , they're , 
that's what they do . 
they take care of basically the front yards 
now do at a 
do things like plant bushes and trees ? 
oh , okay . 
but they don't do it in your yard . 
so , there is , like , no restriction on what types of bushes you can have or anything like that ? 
when we moved into our house i just hated the bushes they had . 
i ripped most of them out and put them somewhere in the back . 
i know . 
and put new ones out front . 
but that was a lot of work . 
took me a long time . 
that's what we did when we first moved in , too . 
just rearranged some things .
and then we put in a sprinkler system , 
i will pay someone .
oh , really ? 
oh , it took so long . 
because because he didn't want to get a trencher , you know , 
there is a machine that will 
oh , yeah . 
because , you know , there is so many people that broke either their water main or their gas main doing it . 
that's true , 
so gosh , 
you did it manually . 
by hand . 
oh , gosh . 
but it works great now that we've got it . 
i bet . 
it's nice . 
that's a good investment there . 
well , we needed to because we're having some foundation trouble , 
you know , you have to keep the area moist 
so , we had an incentive there 
go ahead . 
well , uh , a friend of mine actually works for mcdonald douglas uh , in the space station program 
uh , they're going to be doing a lot of interesting things . 
uh , i think one of the big things he's involved with is the micro gravity payloads . 
and that has a direct impact on a lot of things that we really can't do down here on earth including , uh , some new pharmaceutical techniques . 
oh , you're kidding . 
so , you know , there's 
 so . i suspect that we'll see a lot of gains from that . 
oh , that's good because sometimes i wonder , you know , being a , uh , lay person out there exactly what's going on in space . whether , you know , they're going ahead and doing things and whether or not 
we're spending too much money on the programs and not spending enough money on the earth that we have here . 
being , you know , 
to me , all this , uh , space exploration that we've done thus far has told us that there's no other place like earth . that , uh , we can't live on mars . 
we can't live here , 
we can't live there . 
i mean , this is the place that we have to live . 
i mean , there's , uh , no other resource for us to look at other than here . 
so , it's kind of like , to me , 
i would like to see a lot more money being put toward taking care of the environment that we have here and not so much emphasis put on what's going out in space 
and what , you know , 
not that i want everything to halt 
and let's forget about the space program or whatever , 
because we're always curious 
and we always need to know more things . 
but , uh , to me it's kind of like let's try and clean up the air that we have here . 
let's try to take care of the lakes that are getting polluted and the other things that are going on here . 
mainly because , uh , 
the space program has taught us that there is no other place for us . 
i mean this is it . 
i mean uh , if we would have went into space and found mars a livable , uh , planet , we probably would have inhabited it 
and , uh , you know , who would have cared about earth ? 
it would have been another planet to kind of take over and , uh , continue on . 
you know , and that 
when i look at the space program itself , i think of it , you know , as being in terms of it brings down the fact that this earth is it . 
it's it for us , you know what i mean ? 
but i would love to , uh , go into the space shuttle some day and , uh , just see , uh , you know , the earth and the different planets and things like that . 
i think it would be very interesting to do but whether it would be feasible to do i don't know . 
well , uh , as far as the practical aspects go , i suspect that the space station may actually be a good compromise 
and , uh , you know , perhaps we can find better techniques for doing things that , uh , we'd normally do down here 
that's true , you know . 
and i think of , uh , 
i'm sure you probably have heard of the genesis program that's going on currently out in the arizona desert . 
uh , uh , you know , they're trying to look at how things effect everything in trying to create , you know , an environment where they have an ocean and they have the lakes and then they have the desert part of it 
and then they have an area that's more , uh , you know , full of , uh , vegetation , tropicals , that kind of thing , to kind of look at things and say , you know , environment wise , this is where we're living 
but what effects it 
and how can we improve it and things like that . 
and i think in space , uh , 
i don't know how many people could live up in space , uh , for any length of time .
i mean just the way that we're affected by when it's cloudy out 
and it's cloudy for days 
and we don't see the sun 
and the people , their moods are extreme , you know . 
and this is how i see people reacting . 
you know , when is the sun going to come out ? 
so i wonder how , you know , somebody living up in space is going to be able to tolerate never seeing the sun . ou know , in the aspect that we see it .
well , do you have any , uh , television programs that you watch regularly ? 
oh , this is kind of tough . 
i don't have a lot of time 
and i don't really like some of them to tell you the truth . 
i mean i don't thing they have any redeeming value . 
but , uh , oh , i watch things like , uh , sixty minutes ,
uh , ugh , 
it's kind of tough to think of some of the others . although , i do watch some of some of those frivolous things . 
oh , you will ? 
but , uh . how about you ? 
well , i watch , um , 
i like news programs , like you mentioned , 
and sometimes i will watch , um , like the network evening news program . 
i don't get that so i don't have ,
i like that . 
i watch that a couple of times a week , um , 
it comes on like at nine o'clock ,
and i really don't have any like situation comedies that i watch regularly . 
i have seen that , um , murphy brown that comes on ,
and it's kind of cute , 
but i don't , 
but there's a couple of those i've seen once in a while , 
uh , i can't think of the name of the one that has the , uh , military , uh , fellow . 
oh , but , 
i mean he's playing a military part . 
he's the husband of ,
i know who you're talking about . 
seen it , i think , maybe once . 
you know , it was on one time when i saw it 
and , you know , it , it's pretty cute . 
  i like that  
well , um , i , 
we really don't watch too many programs regularly . 
my children like some of the morning children's shows ,
they , um , 
i just have one son who's in kindergarten 
so in the morning they will like to watch like , um , eureka's castle , it's called . 
it's just like a sesame street ,
 , and they watch a couple of shows like that , 
but i don't watch any daytime t v at all . 
i don't , 
and , uh , 
i guess , uh , there's some , uh , things on channel thirteen that i watch pretty regularly . 
on saturdays they have , uh , a variety of things , uh , 
and a lot of times i record it and watch it some other time . 
but , uh , 
and , um , they have a calligraphy show , 
and i do calligraphy , so , i watch that . 
oh , that's nice . 
and , um , they have a lot of cooking shows , 
and , oh , you know , i'll just short of have it on sometimes to just sort of pick up little tidbits from those . 
i don't sit and watch them especially if i'm , uh , cooking on a saturday evening or something , 
and one of those kind of inspires me . 
that sounds like a good idea . 
i notice that , um , since we moved here that we did get the cable t v , 
and when the newspaper comes out on sunday , i sometimes read through the movies that will be listed , 
and i record some . 
and then , uh , we have just totally cut down , 
and we never go to like a video tape rental anymore because there's always plenty of things that we can record and then , 
so that's been really nice because if you decide one evening you would like to stay home and have a quiet evening and watch a movie then you have two or three saved . 
we do some of that , 
in fact , i probably am more interested in watching some of the movies that are on t v ,
well , that's probably what i watch most frequently besides like news programs is the movies 
and they have a couple of channels that are like nostalgic older movies ,
those are pretty good 
i like those old ones ,
we have really enjoyed that 
and it's really nice not to be running out . 
some of the video rentals can be expensive 
and , boy , 
the movie can be unbelievable . 
going and paying six dollars for a ticket for one person at the theater or something . 
so we , 
i have , 
and it's so convenient at home 
and you can do it anytime you take the notion . 
so , i have really enjoyed that 
but there are , 
i do have friends that watch programs 
like they want to see a particular program and they are either home watching it or definitely recording it . 
they have some programs that they won't miss . 
i'm not that hung up to most things . 
i mean if i miss something big deal .
well , and things are repeated ,
that's true . 
the only one i've ever seen and it'll be showing again . 
pretty funny . 
but , uh , t v is something that we um , deliberately try not to get hung up on it ,
we do too . 
too many other things to do and too much going on . 
and we don't want our kids to grow up thinking that that's what you do with your ,
i agree . 
so it's something that we try doing 
and they could watch several hours every day . 
and you could say , oh , that's a good program for them because it's educational 
but still you want them to go out and do other things . 
even if they're ,
i like that 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
nice to have spoken with you , too . 
what do you think about the war recently ? 
the war ? 
you mean in terms of the economy 
our soldiers going over , uh , 
just everything . 
is that what 
you're kind ,
oh okay .
well  ,
that's the first thing i thought of 
i don't know . 
and even people that didn't agree with the war still seem to be able to separate that ,
i know that , uh , i've heard people say that you know when people that went to world war two 
you couldn't become a political figure or president unless you had served in the war , 
but then in vietnam that was totally different , you know , 
you couldn't be a political figure if you were in vietnam probably . 
and now ,
it would be like a bonus for your ,
 , it , 
i'm sure it caused a lot of changes in terms of how many families had to have their income ,
oh , torn apart . 
oh , yea , 
we had people down the street that the guy was in the reserves and he was just about ready to go and they just had a new baby , 
and , uh , she would have had to go back to work 
so it , 
that's also a good reason why it , 
or good that it ended as soon as it did . 
i think the biggest change that we've seen , um , in my life or whatever lately is the economy ,
and things are so tight , 
and like my husband hasn't gotten a raise in two years 
and it seems like everything is raising , everything that can be , cigarettes ,
i mean it seems like ever , 
even dog licenses 
i mean , 
everything single thing that we do ,
you know . and they just raised the minimum wage today 
but that's not like , you know , 
going to effect too many , 
but , uh , 
so , that's the hardest thing for us 
and , um , we've been trying to kind of maintain traditional lifestyle in the sense of  meaning  home . 
we have a three year old and a two year old 
and i'm trying to stay home as long as i can , 
but , you know , every week it gets harder 
because i could go out and be making money , 
you know , so that's a big , uh , stress i think ,
i don't have any children or anything right now 
uh , i work as a news reporter in waco , 
and so , 
i see . 
i get to see , 
i got to see uh , probably a good part of the war , um , as far as what people thought about it ,
well i , 
it was kind of amazing 
people were coming to me to ask me , you know , what's going on , you know , like i knew ,
you have an inside track or something . 
so , i got to hear a lot of what the people thought about , you know , changes in the war and everything , 
so that was pretty interesting . 
let's see , 
what other social changes in the past ten years , oh , 
i guess between men and women i've seen a lot of changes ,
be everything , be supermom , 
because i know , you know , because i have a career also , 
and i get a lot of pressure from you know , my colleagues 
why am i staying home . you know , 
whereas before that never would have happened  , 
whereas it would have been , 
exactly , um . 
so , that's kind of a difference for us . 
i think there's more pressure on my husband to be more involved with the family . 
so he's , 
the roles are changing a lot . 
he's gotten a lot , uh , you know , 
you see all kinds of men being involved in the housework and taking care of the kids and all , 
but in terms of his amount of hours at work , nothing on that has lightened up . 
so , it's now he has the pressure too of being superdad and supercareer 
and even , you know , i think a lot of the movies we see now kind of play a good part in our changes 
because , you see that they have the three men and a baby type movies . 
that's true , 
and i think , you know that , 
mister mom 
and then you have the women , uh , detectives now and , you know , different roles , 
just in what we see 
so we probably want to do that even more now .
that's true . 
and , you know , we've come a long way but i think it's still have a good ways to go . 
i think there's still , 
i know that , um , i grew up in chicago in the sixties , 
and was part , 
my family was real liberal , 
and i think there's a lot of , um , kind of myths that we've come a long way just in terms of our society ,
and , you know , i think there's so much prejudice still there , 
and it's kind of more covert now . 
people used to be more clear and say ,
and now , you know , i think there's still tremendous amount of prejudice , 
it's just not as , 
but people think , oh , we're in the nineties , we're beyond all that , you know .
but it's , 
i mean like i say , we've come a long way , but we have , i mean , twice as far to go ,
and i don't think a lot of people , you know , realize the plight of a lot of people .
but there's so many more people , 
it's real easy to get isolated in your own little community , 
oh , oh , yeah . 
you know , because when i was growing up in chicago , um , we were in a real ethnic neighborhood 
and there were people from first generation chinese , german , you know all different nationalities ,
and now we're kind of like in lewisville , miss white little suburbia ,
i mean i don't even know anybody  ,
i grew up in , 
oh , boy . 
and so i was just surrounded , you know , by black people , 
because i'm black , 
and so , you know that's where i lived . 
i feel lucky actually because i've almost lived around everyone . 
i went to u t to college , 
and so you know , they have a lot of different people go there ,
and so i feel really enriched in that a lot of people don't get to see , 
you know , some people have lived in lewisville all their life , you know , 
and they , 
exactly . nd th , 
we lived in a dorm . 
my husband and i met in graduate school ,
and you know , coed dorm , 
and there were twelve hundred students , 
they're graduate students from all over the world . 
and once we came here it was like , 
i just miss that , 
because it really is exciting ,
it is . 
we got invited to , 
one guy practically roasted a goat in his dorm 
oh , my god . 
 i wonder if he was  from , iran , or some place , 
i don't know where 
well , there's so many people who have never , you know , even gotten to do that , 
so that's great . 
my sister was telling me in philadelphia , 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , uh , she just met a girl from , um , i think , barbados or jamaica , or something ,
and i mean this girl she had like two outfits that she would just wear all the time ,
so my sister had to take her shopping and , you know , show her what to wear , show her how to match up colors 
oh , god . 
 so , you know , i would have loved the opportunity to do that , 
that is part ,
i mean i even get caught up in it with our kids ,
oh , yeah . 
i mean , people you know think they're kids have to have five ,  , hundred dollars worth of toys . 
  the latest cereal about , you know , th , 
oh , yeah , 
it's just , 
that's ridiculous ,
when i first moved here i was only thirteen but , everyone had a car in school , you know , 
oh , gosh . 
and i just couldn't belie , you know , 
i was from new york so , you know , we road the bus . 
me too , 
and if you had a ca , 
in chicago  ,
and if you had a car there was nowhere to park it anyway 
or , you know , it's just , 
you just didn't have a car , 
but then we came here and they had parking lots in the schools 
and i couldn't understand it . 
you know , all the kids had cars , 
and they , you know , have to have a car . 
oh , gosh , 
so that was , 
my kids are going to be hating me , 
so you can afford to pay the insurance ,
or live really close to school and have them walk . 
uh , yeah , 
a lot of changes . 
i think so .
i guess i'll get back to my laundry .
well , it's good talking to you . 
you too , 
good luck . 
well , we haven't really heard that much in the news lately , about , uh , u s involvement in latin america , since , uh , all this middle east crisis began . 
so i haven't really paid that much attention like , since back in august when all of the news and all of the media began to focus in on , uh , iraq , 
and , the , the last thing that i remember hearing that much about is the iran contra scandal that happened in the reagan presidency . 
can you think of anything else that's happened recently ? 
we haven't had too much , 
but , uh , historically , we've always , uh , almost been like a big brother and to the latin american area , and , uh , almost used them , 
i feel . 
uh , i think something will have to be done down there very soon and , uh , some of the other areas , 
but , with the persian gulf , as you said , it's just , uh , been very quiet . 
i keep pretty close tabs on the paper 
and you don't hardly see a , 
unless it's there and we're just not seeing it . 
well , the only , uh , references that i have seen lately has been , uh , in , part of 
the overmilitarization of iraq was due to companies selling them arms and things , 
well that's , 
i mean , not to this large scale as iraq , 
but that , 
whenever we give arms to people , pardon me , to iraq , when we wanted them to fight iran ,
i agree we're the largest munitions producer in the world , 
so , uh , there's a lot of money to be made there , 
and it's , uh , to cut it back to a , 
and , uh , it will come back to haunt us , 
it seems to come in cycles . 
and i know when i spent , 
the time that i've studied in mexico , uh , uh , there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america , 
about , uh , like you say , using them , yo , 
our interest there is , you know , what profit we could make off of any kind of relationship with them , 
and we weren't normally very interested in them , 
and they have , 
there are a lot of the kind of problems that we've fought for in other countries , you know , 
they have corruption , 
and they don't have , uh , 
i mean , there's just very few really modern cities . 
and that's the drug entry points , 
and their economy is , 
several of the countries , 
especially columbia , is so built our little war on drugs has really been laughable . 
it's just you know , such a small amount , 
and it doe , 
it just , 
it , uh , cuts off just a trickle , 
and , uh , whe , 
that will be another big problem . 
well , that's right , 
because that's just so much of the way that they make their money 
and so many communities uh , have to have that for farming .
and they don't look at it so much as , you know , 
and as long as we're the largest , uh , consumer , then , uh , 
that's right . 
if we can cut back the usage , then uh , maybe it will have to go someplace else . 
and i think it's really very sad that north of the border , you know , the united states and canada is so different ,
there's really a disparity between i would call civilization of the countries , you know . 
we're just so much wealthier , 
and that's where , uh , leaders can uh , use that whenever the opportune moment arises . 
it's really kind of sad , 
that's right . 
our own hemisphere , 
but we've , 
uh , that's been the way it's always been . 
so , uh , 
so i guess we've kind of neglected latin america . 
very much so , except when we need them . 
you know when they found oil in mexico , then we got very friendly with them again . 
recently  , 
fairly recently . 
well , that's really sad . 
i hadn't thought about that in a long time . 
well , i guess then , i will go , 
but i , 
made me stop and think a minute about ,
sure did . 
i know that it's not settled but , there are other areas that we could focus our attention on . 
yes ma'am . 
well , thank you , 
you have a good day . 
you too , dear . 
what kind of music do you like ? 
well , i , uh , 
several years ago a radio broke in my car 
 and i never , 
i got out of the habit of listening to the radio , 
so i haven't been listing , 
i used to just listen to the rock stations 
i don't really know what too many of the most popular songs are unless , you know , they're in the news or something .
but , um , so i tend to listen to some of the older songs that were popular back when i was paying attention . 
and then i like some classical music 
i haven't paid much attention to most of the current music . 
what about you ? 
um , i listen to a wide variety of music . 
sometimes i'll turn on the classical music , 
sometimes i'll listen to jazz , 
uh , every now and then country and western . 
um , i'll listen to some of the rock stations . 
i also like uh , the , the classic rock stations ,
um , i guess the top forty stations or whatever . 
they just , 
it really gets on my nerves because they play so many commercials 
that's true . 
and it gets kind of old , 
and they play the same songs over and over , 
and i just get kind of tired of all that . 
so lots of times ,
but , uh , most of my cassettes , 
i guess , i don't like hard rock . 
um , i have some rock and some jazz and a couple , maybe one or two country and western . some , uh , oh , i can't believe i can't think of his name . um , garth brooks , 
i have a couple of his tapes . 
and , um , but the light rock type stuff . 
i don't , 
i never liked any of the heavy metal 
i never really listened to it because i guess , an established pattern of music to listen to . 
but , and i , 
back a long time ago , when the rap music first came out 
but i , you know , 
now that there's just a million rap groups 
oh , yeah . 
you know , i'm not attracted to that at all , 
but , um , it made a big difference in my life not to have a radio that was   easy access , 
and so now that i do have one , i just don't automatically turn it on 
but , you know , if you go two or three years without having that , 
what i got the most exposure to 
it really changed my lifestyle and kept me from just having you know , easy access to current music , 
so i did , like i say , tend to go back to albums and 
because i have so many albums and cassettes i feel like , gosh , i'm going to have to go out and buy a c d player and then start collecting c d s , 
and it just , 
i haven't gotten around to doing it yet . 
it was around a while . 
it was kind of like , remember when personal calculators first came out , 
and they were really expensive 
and then now you can get one for two or three dollars . 
just like v c r's , too .
i thought of that , too , that if i wait , it'll get a lot less expensive , 
and i can do without it for a while . 
and also they get better quality 
and they learn to have more features and things 
so we're kind of waiting to , like , uh , now , you know , 
and the price of cassettes has gone down 
and a c d is a lot more expensive than a cassette ever was , too , 
right now , i think .
i haven't even priced them . 
i guess they must be . 
oh , really ? 
that is awful .
i bought some at christmas time for friends of mine that have c d players . 
i thought , my gosh , 
now i know another reason why i'm not going to get a c d player for a while . 
well , i can't imagine , um , 
you can't record on them and so they won't be as functional as like a cassette player , where if you heard something , you could record it ,
so c d s won't be nearly as handy . 
see , a , uh , turntable , and then i've got a dual cassette 
so i can record off other cassettes . 
but i never realized you couldn't record onto c , 
i just never really thought about it 
because i haven't really looked into it very much . 
i don't have one 
and i've never really looked at one very closely , 
but that would be inconvenient because i have a cassette player in my car . 
now you know , one of these days when i get a new car , maybe , i guess all of them will probably have c d s players by then , 
but , uh , i'm not planning on doing that for a while . 
i just got mine paid off .
enjoy it . 
i'm going to stick with the cassettes until they , 
now she does have a c d player that she got for christmas 
and she's got other way around , 
well , that's good . 
so i can record some things from her and , you know , get cassettes and record off other ones or off the radio if i want to 
why , we haven't either , 
but the idea of having great extra quality , you know , 
but i'm satisfied to just have what i've been used to , not have to think about the great financial 
but i know one thing that has colored my music choice is when we had children , um , i really started to think about what kind of television programs i was watching ,
because , um , you know , i just didn't want them to be exposed to a lot of things , 
and a lot of the songs have some lyrics that , um 
oh , yeah 
and they get worse and worse , too . 
so i really think we've tried to tone down 
well , that's amazing how when i was in college , i used to have the stereo on all the time or i had on m t v or something , 
but ever since i've been out of college , i guess over the last several years , i listen to the stereo less and less . 
now i will turn on , 
i've got a small jam box in my bathroom . 
i'll turn that on while i'm in the shower and while i'm getting ready because there's really not much else i can do 
 and it's kind of boring standing there , putting on makeup , so i'll turn the radio on 
i might as well listen to the radio while i'm driving to work . 
but other than that , i don't listen to the radio or even to my albums or cassettes or anything very often anymore . 
i guess i'm just too busy doing other things that it's too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to ,
i don't know , 
i just don't bother to do it very much anymore . 
i know what you mean . 
i know my husband , he , um , plays an instrument 
and he played in the band when he was in college and in high school 
 so he has a lot of all different kinds of music , 
and he goes out of his way to play marching band music ,
and i think that's really good because they're learning to like all different kinds 
that's good . 
what instrument does he play ? 
he plays the , 
it's a euphonium . 
it's like a really small , not a tuba , but i th , 
it's hard to explain .
i never had known anyone to play one before . 
i've never heard of that . 
but it's kind of like a small tuba but it's not the kind that sits up on your shoulder . 
but it's a cross between a tuba and , you know , a horn . 
it's a brass instrument . 
 so he plays that and a little bit of piano 
and he thinks that would be good for the kids .
oh , i'm sure it is . 
i was exposed to a lot of music when i was younger . 
my parents had me take piano lessons for eight years , 
i was a real good piano player , 
but then i got interested in a lot of other things 
and i got real involved in many things 
and now i don't have a piano in my apartment or anything . 
i could sit back down and play a few things ,
it's kind of sad that i've let that slip away . 
and i took guitar lessons , i think , for one or two years , 
and , uh , that was about the same time i was taking piano . 
and then i got too busy in high school to really keep up with it between homework and  . . . 
are you a t i er ? 
uh , yeah , 
oh , good . 
i thought , well all these t i ers have gone home , uh , 
i , uh , 
it is friday , 
that's for sure . 
well , uh , i guess , 
i'm trying to think the last thing i did to a car . 
i do it a lot . 
i have , 
i kind of worked my way through college as a mechanic as a kid . 
oh , wow . 
uh , so , and my father and brother were in it 
and my brother's still in it . 
and i had periods when i didn't do anything , 
but in the last ten years uh , my car doesn't go to a shop , you know , 
i just do it all . 
i , uh , 
there's hardly anything other than putting tires on , that i'll do . 
and , uh , uh , i do , essentially do it all . 
i don't know , uh , uh , if there's anything specific . 
in fact , i could advise people , uh , 
i happen to be a m e besides . 
and i guess that's diversion . 
uh , i've tried a few groups , uh , you know , where you , 
i can recommend it for people to take their cars . 
like i think sears is probably the best place 
i just overheard what they did for me , very little because i didn't take it that much . 
but what i heard them tell other people was always right . 
you know , when i sat there , you know , i dropped my car off for tires or something like that . 
so i respect , 
they seem to actually have mechanics there . 
i was pretty impressed with western auto , 
but they didn't do a great job of changing my transmission , uh , oil last time . 
and when 
and i didn't like it . 
so i'm just doing it all myself . 
that's the aggravating thing . 
i try to do as much as i can . 
uh , i grew up on farm so i've got that , uh , you know , take care of yourself attitude . 
you had to do it . 
and , uh , oh , various things . 
i've got an eightythree t bird 
and i've 
um , i guess the last thing i took to anybody to have done was on my wife's car , um , when we went in for inspection . 
it didn't quite pass . 
so we had to have , uh , 
uh , that's a mustang with a two barrel carburetor on it . 
and they had to do some adjustments on that and of course it had never been adjusted so they had to pull it off and pull all the plugs out , to get to it . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , 
uh , i'm kind of stuck on them right now , i guess . 
but , you know , that's , 
it's partially because i can work on them . 
but , uh , yeah , 
we ran into some problems with , uh , having them work on that carburetor . 
i mean , they got everything tuned up right , you know . 
but they , 
i got it home , 
 uh , cap off and it was rubbing 
and it rubbed a notch in that . 
my goodness . 
little things like that , that really start to aggravate you . 
that's a lot of the reason i do my own stuff . 
i and guarantee it so to speak . uh , 
we always fix things and put things in and walk away . 
there needs to be a time of inspection and check out . 
thing like that with a car , 
there ought to be someone there that inspects it before it's turned . 
there ought to be an inspector or quality insurance guy 
when someone does repairs or little things like that , uh , 
an assembly line type operation , 
you're always risking that . 
if there's , too many people that get their hands on one little project , you know , you miss that overlap 
and they miss things . 
i've had a hard time finding anybody i can trust . 
 well , transmissions and things like that . 
i'm not going to tear apart a automatic transmission 
i don't either . 
but , uh , it's real stressful to try to find anybody that i think's going to do me right .
you need to really , uh , 
i do , uh , a lot of the simple things . 
i think i do most of the things better than the average person . 
i worked my way into having the same engine . 
i don't know how long i'm , 
i like a veight . 
and i'm , 
 oh , yeah . 
and i , 
and i almost accidentally got the next car , although i was kind of looking for it when i got a used car with the same engine . 
well then the truck i got next , i definitely looked for the same engine . 
so i buy filters , you know , three or four at a time . 
and essentially 
the cars are different years , but the same chevy veight . 
and the carburetors is the same . 
almost everything is the same . 
the course is two are eighties and one eightysix , you know . 
so you can learn a lot that way . 
there's no way i could fix every car in the world , you know . 
well , yeah . 
you know , that's the three biggest things to me , you know . 
number one , you've got to have the tools around . 
if you don't have the special tools or , 
well , any more 
the testers , that , you know . 
 i don't have a forty thousand dollar diagnostic tester sitting 
so obviously if it's almost impossible to track that down any more 
but if it's under carriage or something like that . 
but , then it's experience . 
you know , a chilton's book or something like and get an idea of how to go about it . 
but you better figure on multiplying that time by at least by five or so .
that was the biggest thing when i did , uh , the heater core in my t bird . 
that is got to be the worst location for it . 
and the only reason i did it , 
i think they're all bad , really . 
are the old lincolns and cadillacs where 
you just open the door and pop it out . 
is that right ? 
i had taken this in to have it done originally . 
and , uh , 
what did they want to charge you for it ? 
oh , it was tremend , 
well it was about seven hours labor . 
so it was going to run about four hundred dollars or so . 
and they looked it over and they thought they could patch it up a little bit , you know , and what not . 
so they , 
this is your little water , uh , heater in there , for uh , 
and it was leaking inside the car ,
so , uh , they did a little patch on it , 
and it held for about four to six months . 
and i finally went back in and started looking at it myself . 
and it's a matter of tearing all the dash out and all that kind of stuff , 
uh , it was not a seven hour labor 
it was about a week before i finally 
did you get it 
i took one off my little buick i had , 
and i pretty much took it loose on the inside . 
but it came out from you know , underneath the hood . 
it came from , 
oh , really ? 
this was , 
the only thing that sticks , inside the engine compartment on this are the two , uh , hose fittings . 
maybe you're right , 
it's been a long time since i took one out . 
i've never heard a good story about , uh , 
course , i broke mine , you know , 
so i'm always very careful when i change hoses on it . 
i don't know whether you did yours . 
not to really pull on those . 
because if you you know , pull on that , 
and i've always done that as a kid , you know , just yanked on it . 
and they must have been stronger and heavier copper at the time . 
but i broke one on my buick . 
and i always remembered it was my own fault , 
and i thought , well i'm going to carefully take those hoses off . 
you bet . 
well the pipe wasn't busted , 
but the , 
it wasn't soldered in good enough . 
oh , really ? 
and it had broken loose enough to where if it got hot , 
it spread out , 
 and just normal driving didn't do it . 
but if it was an especially hot day , the pressure would get high enough 
it was real aggravating , 
but , uh , even 
than four hundred dollars to me , you know , 
sometimes if you're a tinkerer , you luck out . 
my wife's ,
i just heard it . 
i realized that the air conditioning wasn't cutting in . 
and i went out there for five minutes , 
and i just pushed on the wires . 
and sure enough , just pure dumb luck , that the connection over by , 
it's not the evaporator , the big filter on one side . 
i just pushed that in , and i heard it click . 
and so sometimes you have dumb luck . 
i was , you know , 
you could have taken something like that and thought , well , the compressor's not working . or it would have taken me all day probably if i didn't do that . but 
that's true . 
i know , i feel bad for people who just , when anything goes wrong , a fuse , you know , they just have to take it . 
and i know 
i've got girls , daughters , and i've always said i'd teach them . 
and my one daughter was fairly interested . 
and i really haven't gotten around to , 
i learned because i just , uh , learned , you know 
and i'm going to do that . 
i told my daughters in college this year , i said , this summer we're definitely going to spend a little more time on the car . 
well , yeah . 
just pure safety , you know . 
if you can , 
i have the , 
hopefully you're a basketball fan . 
excuse me . 
i'm glad you are , 
i'm not . 
i couldn't care about any of it . 
but go ahead , 
i'd like to see it be more of an amateur sport . 
i'd like to see it turned back to like the southwest conference down here , 
i would like to see texas and all the teams , uh , 
plus i'd like to see them to be true athletes where they're taking a regular college course . 
you know , i'd like to see , 
i , you know . 
since you can talk for hours , go ahead , 
if you like sports go right ahead with this one . 
um , well , i know like what you just said , um , 
purdue had to , uh , 
their best player this year , you know , averaged twenty points a game 
they had to make him sit the bench . and actually kicked him off the team because , um , his , uh , grades , even though they passed big ten standings and they passed , you know , n c double a , did not pass , um , purdue requirements . 
and so , 
that's surprising that they have better requirements . 
that's good . 
that's what i like to see . 
go ahead . 
 and see , 
i'm all for that . 
so he was treated like all the rest of students , you know . 
that's great . 
and so , um , their very best player , 
they probably lost over half their games , you know , by twenty points , which is what he averaged , um , 
and so , you know , he had to sit , you know , 
he was kicked off the team . 
and then they've got three players , top , you know , recruiting class this year that 
they're going to have to be , well , 
the prep school they go to before they can play 
you know , it's just sad 
because , i mean , purdue , even though they're one of the few schools that really , uh , stress academics , they're suffering , you know 
oh , i agree . 
i think that , there's a lot of inconsistencies when some conference , uh , players come from outside of texas , you know , and play us here . 
uh , they're obviously practicing sixty hours a week , you know , 
and there's no consistency . 
seems to me , that like purdue , when they're trying , 
a student athlete is spending so many hours in class . 
he only has twenty , twentyfive , whatever hours he has to spend on practice . 
that has about twenty hours to practice a week . 
but there are teams that practice sixty hours a 
they're not going to class at all . 
i mean , that's 
there's too many semipros in college 
and i think they ought to get rid of that . 
that's what happened to this guy . 
i mean , uh , he didn't go to class , and so they just said , you know , you can't make the grades , 
you're going to have to , 
see you later . 
well , i'm all for the , oh 
baseball has uh , a , uh minor league system , 
and i think that the football and basketball , they asked us to talk about basketball , should , you know , let them go , have a semipro team . 
but i think , i'd like to see college athletes , 
let's talk about college basketball . 
i like that . 
any basketball that i like , 
i like that . 
i don't like the pros at all . 
i don't either . 
uh , they're high scoring , 
there's no defense it seems like , 
and they just kind of score a hundred twenty five points , you know ,   hundred twentytwo , you know , 
and i don't really get much out of that . 
um , yeah , 
it is fun to watch some real disciplined teams play in college . 
and i saw princeton , i think it was , or harvard play this year . 
they're like all white , 
and their starting guard had s a t scores of fifteen hundred . 
and it was so funny to watch them play against the other teams , 
because , it was like , they played so much smarter and more disciplined . 
i don't know if they won very many games . 
but , i don't know , 
their style of play was so much different from 
but that's so much fun to watch because they're pure amateurs , you know , and there's no money involved . 
you go to college , 
you don't really know , 
it loses it somewhere . 
whatever sport it is , if they're really putting a lot of money in , 
these players , let's face it , ninety percent are being paid . 
i'd like to see college basketball and all the other sports go back to being amateurs . 
i don't care about seeing the best players in the world play . 
i like to see the people going to texas just play , the ones that are in class . 
and i'd like to see athletes , uh , or fellow students , like myself , you know , play the game . 
in fact , i like amateur sports . 
i don't see it has to be , 
i don't think that college football , or basketball , should have to be semipro , you know . 
i wish it'd return to the good old days of the amateur . everybody play .
that's what i like , 
everybody should play , you know . 
well again , i'd just like to see the true student athlete , 
i don't like to see the ones that have no intention of going to class , uh . 
then , again just picking a school , 
texas is 
in fac , 
because the other teams i'm sure practice a lot more , 
and s m u down here in footballs and trying to get back , uh , to having true student athletes , 
and that's what i think is a lot of fun . 
there's just so much pressure on the schools , i think to win , though , you know . 
to win and money , 
and , you know , it's like if they don't win , they don't get any money , so , the school suffers , which is kind of bad , 
but that's just how it always is . 
i always thought that university was for an education and then sports of course is part of the education . 
i don't think that sports has to make a lot of money , or you do away with it . 
i don't know why the don't keep fencing and all that , you know . 
and , and they seem to be , 
there's articles in the time magazine and all about whether it be basketball or anything else . 
if it's not making money , then we'll do away with it . 
well , that's not , 
i thought it was so that you give them an education of that particular discipline . 
and i just think that amateur sports should stay in universities , 
that's where it's at . 
i'm sure saddened to see , 
i think it was wisconsin or somewhere , they were getting rid of fencing and a couple of other things . 
i don't know what it was . 
it just seems so sad to have to only rely on , you know , college football . 
is that all they're going to have to make money , you know . 
but i didn't think that was the objective , to make money . 
but it seems like it is . 
huh . it really is . 
i know there's a lot of pressure on schools to have a winning program .
you went to indiana university ? 
uh , purdue . 
oh purdue , 
well , good . 
you're a t i er up in sherman ? 
oh , very good . 
are you from dallas area ? 
but again high school football is just so much fun to watch , 
because , uh , you know , not everybody plays of course , but they're still , 
it's good 
and it's still , 
you know the kids , 
and there's 
and you know they're going to class , you know . 
you heard of , 
it's real amateur sports . 
well , last year , when he was in high school , they drew a crowd of like fortyone thousand for the state finals , when he played . 
is that right ? 
i never heard    , 
that's , uh , 
i never been in a football game in high school that had that many . 
so i mean , that's pretty big . 
like he's from indiana , 
and he plays for indiana now . 
and , indiana   him to be a lot bigger than pro basketball up there . 
the pacers don't really draw that big of a crowd .
you know , the high school games , i mean , that seems to be the big attraction , and college . 
well , my office mate here , earl , he goes to all the maverick games 
and he loves that . 
he would be , 
like he's got , 
i'm looking at his calendar , 
he's got all over the place , 
and he goes to a lot of the maverick games and everything . 
but , i can't get interested at all , 
i listen to him , 
and occasionally i'll watch them on channel eleven , 
i can't , uh , 
more than five minutes of a basketball game , just seems about , 
that's it , 
of , uh , pro anyway . 
seems like you could set the score at a hundred 
then it'd be the same result . 
because they start , 
they shoot so much , 
and then the last , what , five minutes they decide who's going to be the winner , i guess . 
i'm surprised a little bit when you're talking about basketball how some players work . 
mavericks had , oh two players this year that they got rid of last year . 
i'll think of them in a minute . 
perkins , sam perkins , 
can't think of the other one . 
they're both . 
is he one ? 
pardon me ? 
and they both left this past year , 
and both of them were on playoff teams , uh , 
so , they benefitted tremendously by leaving the mavericks . 
and sam perkins , here , he's one guy i did follow 
think he was in virginia , 
i can't think of what school he went to , 
but from . 
i guess he's been here about five , six , seven years in the pros . 
and he was , 
he never quite achieved you know , the super stardom that he had 
but , uh , basketball , they have a nice , 
i don't know if you've down to the sports for reunion arena . 
well , what kind of garden do you have ? 
well , we've tried having , 
let me turn the t v off , 
we've tried having a vegetable garden , 
and i'm from chicago , 
and the way that , uh , bugs and weeds grow down here is very different from chicago .
and we have tried several years in a row , 
and we've given up , between the fire ants , the pill bugs , the weeds , the drought , and a hundred and ten degree heat all summer , 
and we just kind of , uh , decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden .
we had to put so much poison out on everything that we thought , who'd want to eat that stuff . 
you know , so we have really been frustrated by our gardening attempts here , 
and , uh , if you really water a lot , you can do it , 
but , you know , when you have to pay for water , it really gets to be an annoyance to have to water constantly . 
so , right now we're just , 
do you have a lawn ? 
we just try to maintain the lawn and the shrubs right now , and the trees . 
we have a peach tree . 
that's the extent of um , contributing to our food supply . 
but that's nice to have 
oh , yeah . 
so what do you do up there ? 
well , um , actually it , 
we've sort of had an ideal spring . 
and , um , the peonies have been out for now about three weeks 
oh , wow . 
 and the roses have been blooming for two weeks , 
and the grass is , uh , this lush green , 
and of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because ,
but , um , you know , i just keep looking at , 
and my garden , you know , 
my tomatoes are two and a half feet tall 
oh , boy 
the plants and , 
that sounds wonderful . 
we'll have a freeze . 
if you don't have a frost you'll be all right .
that's what i remember from living up north , is that you'd get everything set and then you'd have a frost 
and half the stuff would get frostbitten , 
and you'd have to . 
well , that's it . 
last year , i think it was , you know , my peonies were , budding in january , 
and , you know , there was no way that was going to make it , 
and sure enough , you know , we had really mild weather until 
 and then , you know , everything just got hit hard .
oh , boy , 
that's frustrating . 
but yeah , 
it's interesting , 
and i enjoy gardening . 
my son does the mowing of the grass . 
oh , yeah , 
my husband does that , thank goodness , because that's not a pleasure for me .
i don't think that's a pleasure for anybody , the mowing . 
i love gardens that are well tended , 
and i just , 
there's been a few different places i've lived where i've just n , 
i don't know whether it's little old ladies living there or what , but you could just tell that they had uh , a love affair with their gardens , with beautiful wild flowers , 
and just , 
i love the host of colors that just keep coming all , you know , year long . 
and , uh , i was in england once , 
and that's one thing that impressed me so much is no matter what size yard somebody had , they had a beautiful garden in it . 
you know , it could be three feet by four feet or something . 
so i do admire that , but i haven't really put , uh , too much energy into it . 
course we have two little kids that are two and three years old .
oh , they help you . 
so that has put a crimp in my every activity other than diapers and laundry , i'll tell you .
 oh dear . 
oh but that's nice , you know , 
i mean the peach tree is a start 
that's really lovely . 
i would love to have different fruit trees . 
it's been wonderful to have the peaches . 
they're just delicious . 
and , still have to spray some , 
but we don't have to just asphyxiate ourself with the poison , which is good , 
because i just , 
i can't see the point in doing that and eating anything out of it afterwards . 
what about tomatoes , 
aren't they pretty hardy ? 
um , we've tried them , 
but again , it's just like the sun scorch . 
we've tried them in kind of halfway in the shade and halfway in the s , 
i mean it's just , 
you really 
people that have been successful out here have done this drip irrigation 
and um , that's really what makes the most sense , 
because you don't have to use so much water , 
it really does the job . 
but it's just amazing how hot and dry and for how long it gets out here . 
and if you're not really committed to it , 
i mean , me , you know , i'm real committed to it for about a week , and then i forget about it for a week , 
and by then it's burned up , you know . 
it's just too distracting right now with these little ones in our lives , 
so maybe when i get older .
well , i would assume , too , 
i mean , you've got three or four months you're talking about 
it just gets so hot so fast here . 
we don't have really a spring or a fall 
 and it just , uh , immediately heats up . 
so , that's one thing i miss about living up north , as i remember , um , you know , the long springs and long falls and the cooler weather . 
it was really nice . 
we always had gardens when i was , uh , living in chicago . 
in fact , my mother once tore up our entire back yard  ,
i'll never forget . 
got my stepfather to put in , uh , a waterfall and a little pond in one corner . 
i mean , that was like the most energy invested in anything in the whole time i ever knew him .
they remodeled the entire back yard . 
then they sold the house and got divorced , 
so i don't know what that says about it all .
 oh , dear . 
oh , but she used to love to do stuff like that . 
sounds like it would have been pretty . 
it really was . 
i enjoyed it there . 
but maybe when the boys get a little older , we'll do some more planting , 
because they like to see things grow . 
they've done a couple of little seed projects , 
and so i think it would be fun for them . 
oh , sure , 
well , it sounds like you've got your hands full .
oh , yes .
they're both running around now . 
 and , you know , gardening isn't high on the list , 
but it's not off the list . 
well , it's very therapeutic , 
i think , really to get out there and dig in the dirt ,
they certainly enjoy that part of it .
it's just trying to keep anything . 
i planted bulbs last , uh , fall on the side guard , and when i went out there in the spring 
and the first day they came out the little one went and pulled all the flowers off , 
and the flower petals were scattered all over the walk .
at least he didn't eat them , 
i mean , i guess i could be thankful for that . 
maybe next year they'll do better . 
if they survive this year . 
oh , well , good luck to you . 
well , thanks . 
nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you too . 
have you ever , uh , organized a family reunion ? 
uh , no 
but uh , we are going to have one on memorial day , i guess . 
they have had one the last two years . we go out to you know , it is just a picnic and spend the night .
how many 
oh , about ten . 
oh , it is not that big . 
but i never thought of it really as a reunion . 
i sort of think of a reunion with uh , all the extended family .
that would be hard for us because most of the family is out in california . 
and some is in new york 
and it gets , 
it is kind of hard to get everybody organized . 
uh , is there someone , 
do you all just sort of chip in and help out with stuff when you are there ? 
uh , yes . 
my , uh , dad has a house out there anyway . 
and there is , uh , 
he keeps uh , food out there ,
so he does not live there though ? 
uh , no . 
vacation home . 
it sounds nice . uh , 
just a few . 
it just depends , 
uh , uh , all my grandparents are dead so , uh , you know , none of them are there . 
 and , uh , then an uncle is dead . 
are you all located in texas ? 
uh , yeah . 
we are all , uh , 
like they live up in sherman . 
it is near lake texoma . 
uh , all of his children live in the dallas area too . 
that to me is , 
dallas i know of , 
houston i know of , 
and that is about it .
the rest of it is sort of a big void to me . 
but , uh , you know , we have , uh , well , 
we all got together , 
it was about two years ago for , 
i was , 
i had graduated from college . 
and , uh , i was going to live in france for a year . 
and so my parents invited , 
it was not just family , 
it was friends too . 
but , uh , we all got together for just a party . 
and that was kind of fun . 
nice to have everybody together at once and things like that . 
french reunion ? 
but , uh , it was sort of a reunion before leaving . 
it was fun . 
it was on , uh , new year's day . 
so it was almost a celebration of the new year too at the same time . 
it was kind of fun . 
uh , but who was it ? 
a friend of mine had a big family reunion a couple of years ago 
and , you know , everybody flew in from all over the place for the weekend . 
and it really sounded like it was fun . 
but , i am not quite sure what i would do . 
i think it would be fun to like rent a big mansion or house someplace ,
so that would be kind of fun . 
where nobody lives .
but at least that way it is at nobody's house , so no one person is responsible for everything . 
and they do not have to clean up afterwards . 
that is for sure . 
the cleaning up can be a mess . 
but uh , do you have horses or anything at your dad's farm ? 
i am sorry ? 
does your dad have horses there ? 
uh , no , 
but , he leased , uh , to his neighbor for the cattle to feed on . 
i see , 
so it's , 
so he really does use it as a vacation home . 
it is not like a farm that he has somebody else run for him or something like that . 
pretty much . 
he has a garden and , uh , a lot of fruit trees 
well , that sounds nice . 
do people actually pick the fruit and things ? 
and then there is wild blackberries there too . 
i , used to , 
he gets , 
but we never got enough . 
i used to make jam , 
but i never had enough to really make , you know , more than a jar or something . 
so it was not so worth it . 
they're kind of off and on it seems like . 
depends on the rain . 
that sounds , 
does he have a lot of land to go walking 
well , that is pretty big .
i do not know how they do scale down there . 
you know , here it would be a huge amount of land . 
because they , 
 per , is 
this  house here that has a lot of space is three or four acres .
and , uh , 
and most of it , you know , 
you just spend time on maybe ten acres of it . 
uh , because that is where the ponds are and where everybody fishes . 
we kind of have an informal contest . 
my uncle , uh , put some bass in , uh , his pond a few years ago . 
well , he put some crappie too . 
but the bass , 
we have not been able to catch any of the adult bass yet . 
they are in there , but they are real spooky . 
i think my dad put some . 
we have a little pond at his vacation home too . 
and , y , 
i mean really little . 
and they were having problems with too many goldfish because we had put some goldfish in , 
and there were too many little goldfish , 
and so the big ones never got bigger . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , somebody suggested to get a bass . 
and so they went fishing and caught a bass near some place and put it in there and never saw it again .
never saw the bass ? 
so we do not know whether it is living 
oh , it is probably in there just burping goldfish . 
we still have lots of little goldfish . 
they propagate pretty well , those little fish . 
they really do . 
because we started , 
we have got hundreds in there now , 
and we started with , i think , ten or twenty little feeder fish that i picked up for a dollar , you know , 
but he wants your really big ones , you know , the ones that get to be like a foot and a half long . 
they ha , 
there is a , uh , 
you might put like some yellow catfish in there . 
i do not know if they would live very well up in new york , 
but they get huge . 
and , uh , they routinely use uh , goldfish for bait 
oh , okay . 
well , we would want to put some small ones in so they do not eat the big guys , the goldfish too .
but , yeah . 
we could see . 
i do not know if yellow catfish live up this way . 
but catfish do , i think . 
they live in the mississippi river all the way through minnesota 
so , that , 
you mean , 
well , we could try it . 
that is a good idea . 
because he was trying to catch them , you know , using little , uh , h , h , 
i forget , 
there's little , uh , nets you can use to catch fish to use as feeder fish and things like that .
my father was taking those and trying to catch the goldfish . 
and it was really funny , 
because , uh , one time he left the net in the pond , 
and he like would put some tuna fish or things in the middle of it to attract the fish . 
and , uh , he left it in the middle of the pond .
and that night he came out , and the trap was gone . 
and it was a raccoon that had taken it . 
so it was really funny . 
and you could see that , you know , 
you could see where the trap was dragged and things like that . 
and so , 
that is what happens .
 but do you guys have fishing competitions while you are there ? 
and , uh , we feed the catfish . 
they feed the catfish like , uh , every couple of weeks . 
uh , and sometimes that is the best time to catch them . 
because they will just come after anything then . 
and you could catch a couple anyway 
uh , mixed purina , uh , 
it is , uh , uh , catfish food . 
and it is 
well , i do not know how much different it is from dog food but , you know , 
that is funny . 
 but they come up to the top . 
and it is the best time to take pictures , 
because they come up to the top , and you can see their whiskers come through the water . 
the big catfish just kind of vacuum the top of the water . 
i have never seen catfish , you know , except filleted on a plate , i think maybe . 
i think i have seen once or twice in like the museum . 
but i have never seen them ,
that would be fun to see . 
well , they are really funny fish . 
when you catch them , they make a kind of a burping , growling sound at you . 
and they try to hit you with their tails . 
how big do they get ? 
oh , well , the channel catfish get up to , uh , 
i think the world record is fifty some pounds . 
do you know ? 
that is only about three and a half feet long . 
that is pretty big though . 
they get real fat . 
uh , from the time , 
they stay slender until they get to be , uh , eighteen inches long , and then they start to widen 
uh , we were up there one time and my daughter was fishing .
and i think that was when she was three . 
and she caught a catfish by accident . 
she was fishing for sunfish . 
and she said , "here ," and she handed me her rod and reel 
and , uh , you know , it was just pulling drag out . 
and it swimmed wherever it wanted to . 
that sounds amazing . 
it was nice talking 
enjoy your , uh , weekend . 
have a nice memorial weekend . 
you too . 
now you can tell me what you do . 
uh , well , i work with computers , just like your son 
 and i actually do research in speech recognition 
oh , great . 
but , um , i was working 
well , actually i haven't worked for any large companies per se 
but hopefully the job that i will have will have lots of benefits 
well , the one john works for seems to have you know , good benefits , 
and the pay is decent . 
the , uh , 
well actually , where 
one of the companies i was working for actually had very good health care benefits 
 because health care is so ridiculously expensive . 
because we're paying our own insurance right now . 
and i'm , 
we actually had a little baby 
i had a granddaughter .
oh , congratulations . 
and so one thing that i'm very concerned with now is first of all health benefits 
because it's more important with a family 
 and you know , our routine doctor's visits covered , 
my health insurance only covers , um , the emergency care . 
do you have major medical benefits ? 
but i don't , 
that helps some , 
it depends on what your deductible is 
well , my , 
our deductible's five hundred 
but it's for each 
each person . 
that's pretty high , 
you know , so it covers the emergency things but it doesn't cover if you get sick 
it doesn't cover 
that's right . 
and five hundred dollars is a lot to come up with for each person to be able to start using your 
oh , yeah , 
it certainly is . 
i know where my daughter works , 
now she , 
course we live in a rural sort of setting 
 and where she works she has no benefits at all . 
and her wage is not very good .
but it's the type of area we live in . 
of course , living expenses aren't as bad either , though , which makes a difference . 
and probably the medical care is less expensive , too . 
well , she has to pay for it herself 
 you know , they have to pay for their own insurance . 
but , uh  , 
so i think that in general the doctor's fees are probably lower there , 
and so the insurance would cost lower , 
uh , well , from what i've seen , 
from my aunt and uncle really from florida up to here , 
they're not that much different . 
well , i know that friends of mine had a baby up in boston 
 and their costs were about fifty percent of what it cost to have it in manhattan . 
is that right ? 
and they were at one of the better hospitals , you know 
 and , you know , good doctors in boston . 
that's a big difference . 
and i was at one of the big hospitals in new york . 
but that's a huge difference just between 
 you know , and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable . 
oh , yeah , 
should be . 
so i was pretty shocked at that . 
but the other thing that i'm really concerned about , 
and most companies don't have , 
some are starting to have , is day care 
 because it would be really nice to be able to have , you know , someone that could watch my daughter at work . 
and i'd go to work , 
and if she were sick i could go down and see her , if she needs to be fed , whatever . 
and it would be much more convenient . 
and i , 
it would be more convenient , more productive 
oh , yeah . 
my other daughter works and has , 
they have to take their two children to day care , you know . 
and , uh , it's , 
i don't know how they do it , 
i really don't . you know , 
getting them there and going to work , and then picking them up and ,
and your hours are ,
and , to me , well , that , you know , 
those three things , the health care , vacation , and day care 
i suppose i should be concerned with life insurance and , uh , retirement plans 
oh , i don't know , 
i think those benefits you mentioned , sometimes they're even more important than the wage itself . 
if you can get those benefits even , uh , 
than an increase in your wage a lot of times . 
because you're , you know , 
certainly something like day care at the work place 
i would certainly accept a lower 
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah , 
it would make it a lot better . 
because your life would be so much easier . 
and there's a question of quality of life also . 
uh , well , and if it was there , you would really have a little more , uh , knowledge on what's going on 
but unfortunately , there aren't , 
i think i b m has started having that in certain locations . 
i don't know , 
one daughter works for m c i , 
and where she works they don't have anything like that . 
is that locally ? 
pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 
because pittsburgh's a big enough city , too . 
but you know , i wouldn't be surprised if thing's like that didn't happen more in smaller communities before they happen in bigger ones .
because many times small companies offer better benefits in terms of quality of life than larger companies . 
like , uh , one company had proposed to me that i could come back to work after having the baby , um , any where between ten and forty hours a week .
oh , so they were very flexible 
 and that would be great , 
and which 
many times at a large company it's almost impossible 
they say you're going to do it this way , and that's the way it's going to be . 
and if you get two weeks off , you get two weeks off 
so it all depends on what your position is there , too . 
well , that's true in any company , i think . 
well i can't say i've never , 
i've maybe worked five years out of our married life 
 but , uh , the rest of the time i've been an avon lady and a   lady . 
was that when you were , um , well , 
those have its pluses and minuses , too . 
i've been a consultant recently 
and you have to take care of any benefits you want yourself , 
and the same thing 
my husband is unfortunately being paid as a consultant 
 and we tried to argue that he should get more salary for that 
and , um , they , 
usually consultants make very good income . 
and they refuse to give him more salary . 
is that right ? 
because they say they can't pay more than this and that , and they're not allowed to pay him more 
 and , you know , times are rough now , 
so it's , new , 
it's harder to get 
 but , um , 
a   consultant really should be more knowledgeable than everybody else , you know 
well he's , 
 so it stands to reason they should really have more benefits . 
well , he's been doing a long term , 
he's being called a consultant , 
and he's really sort of a temporary employee at a place . 
and , they pay him as a consultant but he doesn't get any health benefits , 
he doesn't get , well 
we don't care about retirement benefits . 
he doesn't get , um , vacation benefits 
so really his salary should be , you know , twenty percent or thirty percent higher 
and they'll do it , 
do you or your husband work for t i , 
oh , are you , 
oh , i see . 
well , that's neat . 
 and , uh , do you work for t i ? 
so , i've worked for them for several years , like twelve now , i guess . 
oh , you sound very young 
i try to , 
i try to think of myself as young , 
but , uh , well , have you seen any movies recently ? 
uh , i'm trying to think , 
we saw , uh , dances with wolves 
oh , did you ? 
 and , uh , have you seen that one ? 
that was excellent . 
i don't know . 
well , so oddly enough , i do too , 
i get tired of sitting there , and 
but we both just thoroughly , you know 
well , i've heard a lot of good things about it . 
 and , uh , i'm trying to think , 
we went to see uh , a real funny one , 
i can't think now what the name of it was 
i've gone blank . 
we saw the naked gun , two and a half 
oh , we have not seen that , 
we want to see that one . 
 and that was pretty funny , 
and then we saw , 
oh , i haven't seen that one . 
 oh , i can't think of what that was called . 
we saw that too , 
i was pretty disappointed in that one . 
were you . 
uh , so , you know , through the summer , 
we have small children , so we don't get to see too many , but we've seen i guess two or three movies this past summer . 
my husband doesn't enjoy the shows as much going to them , 
likes to rent them 
 and so we watch a lot of them , you know , at home 
and , uh , 
have you seen ghosts yet ? 
i enjoyed that movie , 
did you ? 
now i was real disappointed 
i'm a real big patrick swayze fan 
 and , uh , i was really disappointed in it , 
it was , 
i don't think it was as funny as what i was anticipating , 
and i guess i was expecting it to be kind of funny 
oh , yeah , 
it was more of a love story 
 and , uh , so i was really disappointed in that because i like him 
we just got through watching one with , uh , uh , is it claude van damme 
uh , van damme , 
i think , 
i can't think what the name of 
it was uh , of course , one of the typical 
and we enjoyed that , 
and , uh , uh , uh , the one with jody foster , did you see it ? 
oh , silence of the lambs ? 
wasn't that excellent ? 
that was one that stayed with me 
i just , 
i kept thinking about it , you know , 
well , it's amazing , 
but really , i mean , when you stop and think about it , anthony perkins didn't have that big a role in the movie 
and yet it was his character that was so intriguing , 
oh , it was excellent , 
and , of course , he's such a , uh , very good actor anyway 
 and , i think he made the movie , 
i do too , 
i really did 
 you know , jody foster was good , too , but that really made the movie , 
i agree with you . 
oh , hopkins , 
i'm sorry 
hopkins , 
i always get those 
i know 
i know . 
it , uh , well , 
i'm not a real big jody foster fan , 
but i thought she was good in that . 
well , i agr , 
well , i haven't been , 
i saw her in the keys , 
and i thought that was a pretty good movie , 
but i thought she , 
now , i didn't see that one . 
that was pretty interesting movie , 
i did , 
i really liked the silence of the lambs , 
that was really intriguing , 
and it didn't scare me all that much , you know , 
and i don't like to go to movies to be scared , 
that's not why i go 
i like a good suspenseful 
and that one was . 
and that one very definitely kept you on the edge of the seats , 
in fact , i want to , uh , rent it when it comes out for my husband to see , 
because , he didn't 
oh , he didn't see it ? 
i went with , uh , our daughter 
my all time favorite is weekend at bernie's . 
oh , really ? 
did you see it ? 
oh , i've seen it , you know , 
we saw it at the movies , 
and then we've rented it several times 
 and , we just love it , 
in fact we have a ten year old grandson 
he and my husband and i , we just sit there and cackle 
i've seen that . 
it's pretty cute . 
i guess , you know , as far as comedies go , probably my favorite is young frankenstein . 
uh , yes , 
i love that movie , 
my husband liked that 
 uh , he's a big gene wilder fan , 
well , gene wilder doesn't do that much for me , 
but i'm a big , uh , mel brooks fan 
all his movies , i really   .
he has a new one out . 
he does ? 
uh , i have seen it advertised . 
i don't know what the name of it is . 
oh , is that the one that's he's starring in ? 
oh , yeah , 
that came out , like early in the summer or something like that . 
i haven't seen that one either . 
my husband wants to see that one , 
and , uh , did you see that one that he made years and years ago about uh , the sheriff 
oh , blazing saddles . 
oh , that's my husband's all time favorite , i think . 
oh , uhhuh . 
i like that one too , but i thought young frankenstein was better . 
did you ? 
i just really enjoyed it , 
and , uh , um , i'm trying to think , 
because we saw another one that we thought was really good , early this summer , that was a suspenseful movie . 
i'm trying to remember what it was , 
because you know , it's , 
capital punishment . 
what's your views on it ? 
um , for myself , i'm personally against it , 
but we seem to have a duality of , in this country where most states in theory have it , but do not use it . 
well , i'm for it . 
i think there are certain crimes that definitely , uh , call for it . 
i feel like that child molestation and murder 
i don't see any sense in someone living that does things like that . 
i don't feel like they're a benefit to society in any way , 
and of course texas has it , but they very seldom , you know , put it into effect . 
so instead all of our prisons are full of people on , you know 
okay , well , 
uh , texas uses it about as much as any other state . 
well , uh , yeah 
texas is a big state , 
which is not very often . 
um , here in maryland to the capital punishment law , 
people are sometimes sentenced to capital punishment , but actually has the sentence carried out . 
uh , i'd certainly , 
what do they do , just keep them on death row 
i , uh , 
  or affair number 
 uh , in fact , i think that , it affected the sentence though capital punishment is available , 
the sentence of life without possibility of parole , uh , has become a common one , and is being used much more . 
do you have the overcrowding in your prisons that we are facing down here ? 
uh , i don't know the exact numbers , 
but yes , 
i know that we have , you know , 
really in fact they're releasing people , uh , that are in there for , you know , not major crimes , but , uh robberies and assault and things like that , 
and , because they don't have room , then they're coming back on the streets and of course , doing it again , 
and um , you know , so we're having problems in that way , 
and i know that there are some cases that , uh , you know , capital punishment does not fit the crime , 
and there are extenuating circumstances on certain types , um , but i have to say that i'm honestly for it 
you're certainly in the majority 
uh , we are , i guess , the only one of the major western nations currently with capital punishment . 
i know they use it very , um , 
they do not have it in europe , as i understand . 
at least not in western europe . 
probably not in eastern europe these days either . 
um , there are many reasons for it , 
but they certainly have lower crime rates and lower murder rates . 
you wonder you know , how they manage to do that . 
well , in part uh , it's the nature of societies , perhaps more homogenous society , in many cases , uh , 
arguably , if 
arguably is because uh , of , uh , welfare state benefits . 
we tend to be skeptical . 
well , england fairly large welfare ? 
however the question is is that making the difference . 
oh , i don't know . 
but we have a lot of welfare programs 
if both do and they tend to have less crime , you wonder if that has anything to do with it then , 
you know , or is it , 
in our society , people are brought up over here thinking that , you know , everybody owes them something . 
um , even more common in western europe . 
oh , do you ? 
well , that's interesting . 
i would not have said that . 
i would have said that it was more prevalent here in the united states . 
that's an interesting theory . 
i'm not that familiar , you know , 
i've only been over there a couple of times 
and i'm not that familiar 
me , too . 
all i know is that , for instance we were in germany in , uh , 
why don't you go ahead and start . 
well , we subscribe to people magazine and to time , 
and , of course i like the people magazine because it's gossipy 
and , uh , the time of course , is , uh , you know , more newsworthy 
and , uh , it has more world affair type things , of course . 
and then i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally , especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and 
 and , uh , do you subscribe to any magazines ? 
for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because , uh , i have so much going on in my life 
that seems to be the last thing i pick up , 
so i found that i was wasting my money . as much as i enjoy them , uh , when i do subscribe 
i've gotten in the past the parents magazine and , uh , the housekeeping magazine 
you probably have smaller children 
our children are grown 
 and , uh , i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren .
well , i found that after a couple of years of having a parents magazine it was getting repetitious , 
so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason . 
uh , the housekeeping magazines i do like because like you say , they have nice , uh , recipes in them and ideas , but , uh , lately they've just been piling up on me , 
so i figured it wasn't , uh , something i needed at this point in time . 
well , do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to ? 
i don't know , 
i , well , 
my husband would love to have more . 
now he's the type who will get the , uh , inc . magazine and money magazine and all the financial type magazines , 
now my husband does that , 
 you know , and of course , uh , naturally wall street journal , you know 
but i don't know , 
i know a few people leafing through them at the store 
 but you just don't hear people talk about them , 
and i know years ago , when , uh , my children were young and stuff , i just loved ladies home journal , mccall's , good housekeeping , 
and i took them all 
 and , uh , then , oh , i don't know what 
in the seventies , maybe , late seventies they changed their format 
 and i haven't , 
i don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be 
even good housekeeping i don't , 
and some of those have had what i consider or what 
i get the idea that they are maybe the more pricier type magazines , as far as women's magazines . 
they seem just to be so chocked full of ads . 
oh , they are . 
my sister , uh , takes , uh , town and country and vogue 
 and she sends them to me , 
and there's really nothing in them but advertisements 
 you know , and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living 
 and i do , 
i just , 
what i do is i flip through them and pitch them then , you know , 
they're not something i , you know , take any length of time over . 
i have discovered that , you know , with my available time , i would rather actually read a book 
i enjoy books a lot more 
that's true . 
 and , uh . 
so , but . 
now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to , 
other than my children have gotten . 
you know , they get tons of magazines it seems 
they're always getting something in the mail 
uh , so between reading to them and , uh , reading the newspaper , 
and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance , 
but i just don't get a chance for those , uh , newsy magazines , the ones that are full of ads , 
unless you just want to skim through while you're , 
i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or , you know , waiting on something like that . 
i will read them in a doctor's office , too . 
as i said , uh , to people and to time , 
uh , and i will go through the time , but , usually not cover to cover , you know , 
i'll glance through it . 
i like reading , uh , you know , the passage of people or something 
uh , but i do like the people magazine . 
it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and , uh , that's one , you know , i really like that , 
i enjoy that . 
it's quick reading 
it doesn't require a lot of thinking , 
and sometimes after i've worked all day 
i don't want a lot of thinking .
that's true , 
that kind of is a good way to do it . 
it's much more relaxing . 
sometimes when i read time magazine , after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world  , 
so . well , it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines 
 and , uh 
 so , uh , i think that probably i will end the call . 
i've enjoyed , 
um , i very seldom read a newspaper . 
i get most of my news information from t v . 
mainly , um , if i'm really wanting an indepth thing i'll watch c n n . 
and i find it one of the best . 
and , uh , otherwise it's just one of the regular , uh , channels eight or five . 
and , uh , where do you get yours ? 
uh , mostly from t v too . 
i and six 
um , we do take the dallas morning news 
and , uh , once in a while i'll sit down and you know , 
but not very often do i read the whole thing . 
quite often just scan through the headlines 
well , i take the dallas morning news 
and my husband , uh , he reads it cover to cover . 
and , uh 
i kind of quit reading it , oh , several years ago when the kids were teenagers . 
it just seems like i was so busy all the time , 
and if i wanted to read , i wanted to read something light and relaxing and 
and so i coul , 
and it got so depressing .
seems like it wasn't anything but bad news .
if there's something , you know , that i want to know more about or som , 
might be the killeen murders . 
i've been kind of intrigued . 
i guess it's kind of the sadist in everyone .
you just , 
i'll go through and read it . 
uh , but i find that i do better with , oh , remembering it and everything if i watch , uh , the t v 
and they kind of capsize it 
and watch , 
and i think sometimes it's , you know 
oh , yeah . 
and sometimes .
that's true . 
you know . 
i wanted a little more detail like , you know , 
they would tell more about the people that were killed , where they were from and how old they were . 
and i guess you know , you 
and with interest , you know i found some people that were members of our church which was different . 
and that made you even feel a little more kin to what was going on . 
oh , the same type of church . 
so that made it a little more and that they were from utah also 
oh , uhhuh , 
so that was interesting , 
but i enjoy the news . 
e , once in a while will sit down and watch it 
i used to , uh , 
or i didn't used to 
but , uh 
when my grandchildren uh , have stayed over before and even maybe when our kids were younger one of the channels used to give brief inserts of news at a child's level . 
and i thought that was very interesting , 
and i thought that was very important for kids . 
like they brought down something that had happened like if there was something going on , uh , in the war , they would bring it down to a child's level in words 
and , uh , i noticed that my grandchildren seemed to kind of enjoy that . 
the oldest one he's 
and , uh , he would particularly enjoy this 
 been  a couple of years ago . 
and , uh , i think that's really interesting . 
actually i even understood it better .
that's nice sometimes when they 
 you know . uh , but as i said , uh , i ten , you know , 
nobody should get that way about the news .
oh , do you have a certain station you like to watch when you watch it 
we like channel eight . 
do you ? 
it's the best . 
um , channel five for some reason has always been 
is that been 
i don't know 
it's probably the anchors . 
they just kind of catch you . 
i don't know . 
i very sel , 
and i thought it was very interesting , uh , 
channel nine watching it when the murders were in killeen 
 and going on . 
they were having news coverage 
the c n n , is that what that is ? 
and , you know they have that hour that nine to ten 
and so we had the t v on 
and we were trying to catch all of it , 
and they were showing some 
and i was watching , 
my husband and i were watching it , 
and then we switched over to channel eight , 
and the difference in coverage was unbelievable . 
i can understand uh , you know , why they're kind of behind . 
did i say channel nine to begin with ? 
no , chan , 
i don't get that channel .
i was thinking nine to ten . 
but channel eleven , 
that is if you want to go to bed early 
it's nice to watch that early news 
it , uh , 
but the coverage wasn't near as good  as  when we , you know , switched over to channel eight 
and they didn't e , 
uh , oh , i can start . 
the biggest , uh , improvements in women is that finally you're starting to see them get into , uh , management 
 and you're seeing them , uh , get , uh , elected to , uh , political offices .
i know there's still a long way to go especially in top management .
i agree . 
you're not seeing , you know , 
looking at t i , you see them in management , but you're not seeing them up there as v p s . 
and i have a sister that's an attorney in oklahoma city , 
and i know the company that she was with , uh , 
the women didn't the levels that the men attorneys had .
i agree with that . 
i think you do see more and more women out there in politics , too , as mayors 
i think still , even with that whole , um , thing with judge thomas you still felt like the woman was the one that you would maybe discredit first before the man 
or something the way they had the trial 
uh , but it's still , uh , 
going from homemakers into , uh , corporate leaders is still a big step . 
i also think that , uh , uh , women as homemakers are beginning to get more respect than they used to be . 
particularly even by women in the work force . 
but , i think people are realizing that the roles women play in the home are very , very important . 
and it's getting the respect which is about time . 
i think it's true . 
i think also people are having children at a older age 
very definitely . 
 so it's maybe like , uh , you know , 
you go through college 
and then you maybe work for a few years 
and then you have your first child 
and , uh , you know both sides of the coin . 
that's right . 
you know what it's like and how much work it takes to keep the house running smoothly , and to take care of the kids . 
and then , uh , maybe people that are just working and think , oh , you just stay at home . 
but then when they're in their thirties and have their first and second kid , it's like , they lose it .
this is harder than i thought .
well , you know . 
you know , and have stayed home with the kids , kind of does your heart good .
i know it , 
because i know i stayed home with mine and didn't start working until mine were in high school . 
it kind of does me good . 
i think also one of the things the fact that the fathers are 
are so involved . 
which , again , i think helps a woman's role . 
you know , 
their role has to change 
i know , 
i have three children 
and my oldest is eleven 
and i've pretty much been home , uh , since brian was born 
and , uh , just recently i went back to work , uh , last school semester to tutor , uh , high school age students with learning disabilities 
and i was just out of the house two days a week 
 but , i thought , wow , this is really hard , 
and it was only two days 
and i was home before three . 
but getting the baby to day care , getting the kids off to school , i still did everything i always do , you know , 
my husband still got up and went to work 
 but , uh , it , 
only those two , 
it made a big difference . 
i thought , wow , full time , 
i don't think i could swing that personally . 
well , i had to , 
course , i work full time , 
but my daughter and her husband were out of town 
so i had my grandchildren for 
oh , boy . 
 and so i would work 
and her , 
some friends would take care of the kids , 
but i would have to get them picked up from there 
pick up .
i was absolutely exhausted . 
i bet , 
and these women that are waiting until they're in their late thirties , or early forties to have their first children , i think are absolutely crazy . 
well , i know a lot of people , 
i know i had my first child when i was twentyfive , 
and that's not considered really young these days , 
that's almost , you know 
 but , uh , i have friends that have kids just starting kindergarten 
and they're forty years old . 
and then like maybe a two year old at home , 
and i think , boy , i'm in my thirt , 
 and , uh , i'm trying to think of the ones that i've been on that i liked the most 
oh , did you get to go to hawaii ? 
we went there for our twentyfifth wedding anniversary . 
we went , uh , six months after we were married . 
and we just went to , uh , two islands . 
what islands did you go to ? 
we went to oahu and kauai . 
we went to kauai , 
and then we also hit maui , 
and then , of course , uh 
the big one . 
 uh , the big one , 
with , uh , the big one i thought was very commercialized . 
oh , yeah . 
it was . 
but the other two were just lovely . 
i enjoyed kauai better , too . 
it was quiet and restful , and so beautiful . 
it wasn't commercialized . 
oh , it was rainy .
 , was it ? 
but , you know , we don't like to spend the money to go over there and sit on the beach anyway 
that's right . 
well , it wasn't real rainy . 
we had a few showers , but , uh , nothing that really got in the way with anything and just very brief ones 
and , when , uh , 
now we went to nassau 
and my husband liked it better than he did hawaii . 
oh , really ? 
he really did . 
i don't know why . 
you know , he didn't like oahu at all .
he thought 
did you go there ? 
that was wonderful 
 and we both enjoyed it 
that was .
you know , i've been to nassau , too . 
have you ? 
i went on a cruise . 
oh , neat . 
and , uh , to tell you the truth , i think i'd rather just go to the island . 
uh , our son and daughterinlaw uh , they got married last january and they won a cruise . 
and i know they didn't like it . 
now , we have several friends that , uh , have been on , and just love them . 
but james and i like , 
i don't know , 
i think we would get bored on the boat all the time . 
well , i , got sick . 
oh , did you ? 
i went 
and we both , the first night , just had to leave dinner . 
it was bad , 
it got better , 
but we just , 
it was a four day 
 and we were both ready to get off the boat . 
were you ? 
well , i think if we ever go , it will only be for a three day . 
now we've been real lucky . 
we've been to europe twice . 
oh , have you ? 
the first time we went to london , europe and touched a little bit of scotland .
and second time we went to munich , germany and were there a week , and loved germany . 
i'll bet it is . 
and we were there in the fall before the snows , you know , started 
and it was wonderful . 
and we would love to go back there 
and we'd love to go back to london . 
you haven't been to spain ? 
have not been to spain . 
i was born there . 
were you ? 
how old were you when you left ? 
uh , just ten months . 
oh , ten months , 
have you ever got to go back ? 
would you ? 
uh , my sister , 
we went with them to germany 
and , uh , she would like to go to spain . 
i'm not sure whether i would like to or not . 
and , uh , i would like to go to ireland . 
would you ? 
now , now i don't know if i'd like to go there just from 
well , the 
   there is 
is a little scary , 
but i would still like to see it . 
i'd like to see , uh , italy . 
oh , yeah , 
i would love to go there . 
that would be nice . 
and , course , there is a lot of places in the united states i still want to you know , go to . 
now , have you been to yellowstone ? 
have you ? 
i was there as a child and then we , we went to california and came back through yellowstone with our kids . 
and they loved it . 
i was in utah , in salt lake city when i was a , uh , youngster . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , uh , you know , i've touched on that . 
now i'm just about , oh , a half hour , uh , north of salt lake . 
so , uh , it's at 
my husband works in salt lake , 
we're real close 
and , yeah , 
now that's a pretty city . 
we like it . 
very clean .
it is . 
utah is a pretty state from what i remember of it . 
well , we kind of like it .
well , do you like to camp , those kind of trips ? 
we used to camp a lot with our 
oh , you like the motels ? 
oh , oh , well . 
we've gone past the camping stage . 
we lived in chattanooga , tennessee for two years . 
oh , did you ? 
and we did a lot of camping out there in the smokeys 
and it was beautiful 
and our kids loved it and everything 
and then we moved to , uh , uh , the dallas area 
 and , uh , it's hot down here 
and camping is not near as much fun . 
and were involved in activities so the camping sort of went by the wayside .
uh , and our daughter and her husband are talking now about starting camping with their boys now that they have gotten older . 
so i've been concerned about crime lately . 
uh , it's really scary to listen to the news every night and 
i wondered if you were taking any special precautions in your neighborhood ? 
i'm not real , 
we don't get real involved . 
we're never home , 
 uh , uh , well , i know they were going to start one , 
but , uh , i haven't heard any more since , 
so i don't really know . 
but as far as personally doing something , no . 
no , um . 
how about you ? 
well  , there wasn't any outside lights 
mostly , you know , not so much thinking that we would deter someone to break in , but that our children would be safe 
and i guess most of the crime that i'm concerned about generally is against my kids . 
oh , i'm sure it is . 
we don't have any . 
we did install  , a , uh , motion detector light back in our driveway . 
and mainly it was so when we pulled up , the light would come on , 
but also we have a boat back there 
 and we have neighborhood kids that like to get into mischief , 
we thought with that light , you know , it would maybe keep them from doing something .
 well , we've been real lucky that , 
i don't believe there's been , you know , much trouble in our neighborhood , 
but it 
what it is . 
we live in ,
and they don't , uh , 
i know my sisterinlaw who lives in our neighborhood 
they parked their car out on the street before and it's been spray painted and 
oh , no . 
and , course , you know , 
i'm getting scared for kids to get older , 
because you don't know if it's someone their teenagers know 
but , uh , we've been real lucky that no one in my family been a victim of , you know , a serious crime . 
but , uh , it's really scary to know that you can live a normal life and try to be a good citizen 
places usually that i wouldn't be going .
and , uh , there's not so much of it completely innocent 
but it is scary . 
it is . 
were you 
 really is  .
i'm originally from chicago , but i've been in this area , in the lewisville area for , uh , let's see , about twentythree years . 
in the last few years , i think , 
and , uh , like i say , 
now i don't think necessarily in this area here , but 
i don't know , 
i think back of when i was , uh , younger and in my party days , some of the things i did , you know , i wouldn't be caught dead , like , being out that late at night .
in the dark parking lot .
take a lot of chances . 
well , i noticed uh , that , uh , when 
we moved here from houston 
so , of course , we were interested in schools 
 uh , but the schools in houston all have big , tall fences around them 
and they're not really very safe 
 and so it's been interesting to come to the plano area where the schools don't have fences at all  ,
and it's just a whole different idea that , at least the people here feel that their kids are pretty safe at school . 
and in houston there was the mentality that they weren't safe at school . 
and so that's been something that's been good you know , in this area that you feel like , uh , you know , there's not going to be too many knifings or shootings 
 and i guess , 
i don't know how people live with that 
i don't either . 
pretty scary . 
yeah , um . 
but , anyway , well , i guess i won't take up more of your ti , 
well , i am new to texas , 
so i don't even know what the law is ,
do you ? 
well , yes , 
of course , we do have capital punishment . 
and we've , you know , done away with our , quote , fair share number . 
oh , that's right , 
i think now , that i recall , reading about it in the paper . 
um , you know , different things , 
is it restricted to certain crimes ? 
or just , 
um . well . 
it seems to be a disproportionate number of blacks , you know , that get into the system . 
i know , 
the one thing that i think is really sad about it , as i recall , from the articles that i've read , is that if people who have been there , are going to be killed . um , there's people that come to the prisons and they're very violent 
and , they want , 
i mean they're anxious for someone to be killed .
i just , 
i can't see that . 
that happens on occasion , 
it sure does , 
maybe it just depends on , you know , how closely the crime , you know , 
you know , i don't know , 
or a person personally . 
i think i would be , you know , 
really if i had to say yes or no , i guess i would say , you know , that i am in certain cases , in favor of the death penalty , 
i don't know that it's a big deterrent really . 
i don't know that it is . 
i don't know how we'd ever find out , you know , really whether it is or not . 
well , there is so many chances for appeal , that it kee , 
oh , yeah , 
oh , absolutely , 
it goes on for years and years , and costs hundreds of thousands of dollars , taxpayer money . 
it's really sad . 
i don't know , 
i just think , um , 
somehow i hoped that as a people we could be better than , um , expecting ,
someone is calling for someone else to be killed , you know . 
is really kind of bad .
it is . 
it's a tough , tough question . 
it really is . 
i suspect i would be , uh , you know , a lot more favor of it if , you know , one of my children were , you know , brutally killed , or something like that . 
like i say , i think it depends on how personally affected , you know , you might be by it . 
and there really are criminals that are hardcore and ,
oh , absolutely . 
that's right . 
  oh , i don't know , 
is it , 
do you feel at all like , it's a religious issue ? 
it is with a lot of other people . 
it's not to me personally , 
i don't know , 
sometimes i feel , 
i mean i do go to church and things . 
i don't know how i would feel about it . 
but like you say , if it hit you personally ,
it's a tough , tough question , 
it really is . 
do you think most states have that 
but , i think the u s is one of the few countries that still do . 
that still does it , 
that's right . 
they're only , 
i was reading something about it the other day , 
i   think there was only like six or eight countries in the world , that have capital punishment still . 
a lot of them had to have elected not to do so . 
now i don't know , what they do in place of it . 
you know , maybe it's life in prisonment or , you know , something , 
i don't know how they handle it 
bu , i was surprised to learn that so few countries have capital punishment . 
have that . 
well , and it doesn't seem like very many people , uh , are really , i mean , 
there's a lot of people that are on death row .
oh , yes . 
a lot of them do get their sentences commuted to something else . 
so , it seems like a of people live there , 
and then through appeals . 
because i know they do frequently , 
i mean they cover it pretty heavily on television and the newspaper . 
if it finally gets to that point . 
the first appeal is automatic , 
so that delays it for a few years just right off the bat . 
there's a lot of , you know , last minute , uh , things that happen cause a person not to ,
so is it , uh , 
are we doing lethal injection now ? 
before that , it was , uh , death by electrocution . 
which seems so awful . 
it certainly does . 
so , it's a little bit more humane , 
i guess , it is , 
it would almost have to be , i suppose . 
i am sure i would take the lethal injection . 
the other one just seems so terrible . 
it's a tough question . 
it really is . 
i guess , if i had to say yes or no , i would say , you know , yes . 
i would have to lean toward capital punishment , you know , for certain crimes . 
well , do you think that we do it because we want it to deter crime 
or , it's not because we don't want to pay for inmates to stay in prison ? 
i think , 
we hope that it will be , you know , some sort of deterrent or , you know , an eye for an eye type thing , or something like that . 
some of the crimes are just so brutal and so , you know , useless . 
this may seem to be the best way out . 
i don't know . 
easiest way out maybe . 
um . well , um , and i notice that the crime  rate  was up in the dallas area .
especially the murder rate , its just gone crazy . 
i wish i had the answer for that , 
everybody does . 
you hate to have the dubious honor of being , you know , so high in the , 
it's nothing to be proud of , 
certainly not . 
but i , you know , 
we have been really fortunate 
our family ,
so have we been very , very fortunate . 
and , so we don't , 
it's harder to think about the poor people that have suffered that way . 
that's right . 
and how they would expect ,
i mean you hear of people who have , um , committed crimes , and then they get out of jail and they go , and they do the same thing again . 
and you wonder why they can't just stop it . 
that's right . 
so , maybe you would , 
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone . 
so would i , 
fortunately , i have never been in that circumstance , 
i hope i never am , like everybody else . 
i know when , um , 
jury summons , 
just like constantly , it seemed like , 
but fortunately i had small children 
and i didn't have to go . 
and it's not that , 
i mean , i think everyone should have to serve on the jury , 
it's just that , i didn't , 
i hate having to be in charge of someone else's life . 
it's a big responsibility , 
it really is . 
and i would hate to have to hear any kind of case ,
so would i . 
that would be really awful . 
well , anyway , i sure have enjoyed , uh , talking to you about this . although it has been difficult 
but , uh . 
it's a tough subject , 
it really is . 
i'd hate to decide it , but i uh , guess it's important ,
that's right . 
anyway , well , you have a good day . 
well , thank you , 
it's nice talking to you . 
thank you , 
well , patricia , i was just about to get on my tread mill , 
well , i have an exercise bicycle in my bedroom , but it usually's holding clothes .
that's what i did with mine ,
and sometimes she just flops them all over the seat . 
well , that's not why i got it , 
how do you like your tread mill ? 
i like it . 
you don't get , 
is it less boring than the bicycle or not . 
you watch t v or something while you do it ? 
but i was doing that on the exercise bike . 
well , i do that too . 
i feel like i'm getting a little better of a workout , and i'm losing more weight on this 
are you ? 
and my legs , you know , 
i'm going to turn forty this summer , 
i was getting all dimpled up .
and those are going away . 
so that's real good . 
we got it at a little bit of an incline . 
are they kind of expensive . 
this is five hundred . 
i know they get cheaper . 
they do ? 
probably the more you pay , though , the better the machine you have . 
well , i hope so . 
i didn't buy it really . 
my husband bought it because we'd never get out and go walking or anything , 
and we go to the lake 
and we ski and swim in the summer 
during the year . 
well , in bad weather , you know , well you'd have to do something inside . 
do you work at t i ? 
i think , your voice sounds familiar . 
where do you wo , 
i live in arlington . 
where do you live ? 
i'm in garland . 
no , uh , 
oh , really . 
uh , no , 
he's working at night tonight . 
let's see , 
 well , that's interesting . 
it's more interesting than the treadmill and the bicycle . 
oh , my goodness .
and she was , 
a school administrator . 
well that could , 
retired , but . 
i don't know . 
pardon me ? 
oh , i don't know . 
does your husband work with t i . 
oh really . 
i have a friend that had a roommate 
well , that's interesting . 
i don't know , 
oh , my . 
well , like what , 
are you listening to him ? 
he's telling me to start the grill . 
let me see what else 
oh no , 
i don't , 
you mean the clocks . 
i can , 
i'm going crazy , 
my daughter's playing the piano 
and i can't think . 
oh , god . 
isn't that funny . 
oh yeah , 
they're pretty . 
and , uh . 
well , you know , 
oh , no . 
well that's okay , 
let's see , oh , 
i tried exercise classes , 
and i never would go . 
we fin , 
we joined , ex . 
  i went to metropolitan a couple of years ago , 
so i sit and study , 
i sit in class , 
and i have really ballooned up since then , 
and , so , he's says i ought to join one of those that makes you go , 
but    , 
they don't either , 
well the first one i joined , they went out of business 
and they transferred it to another one that was really far away . 
that's a very common experience . 
and we were going to do it , 
there was four of us together . 
well , then forget that , 
it wasn't near me . 
and then the second time i was going to do it at richland college , 
and we , 
i just get with another friend , 
and we'd end up just smoking cigarettes and riding around like we couldn't find the place .
that's funny .
so my husband's just discouraged me on those things . 
well , if you can make yourself do the tread mill , i mean , gosh , that's a good workout . 
oh yeah , 
my husband said he's never joined a course , right . 
and i got one of those jane fonda workout tapes that i dubbed from a friend . 
that didn't last long   
i had a baby , i think .
how many children do you have ? 
i do , too . 
a girl , one's in college , 
so i don't have a baby anymore .
oh , lord , 
you're lucky . 
well , i've got a stepdaughter , 
she's in college . 
oh , well . 
so there's where the money goes . 
  tell me about it , 
where's you ki , 
  putting two of us through , isn't he lucky . 
well , me , i'm going , and my daughter janet in austin . 
so , i'll probably have to sell the prize i get .
where you going to school ? 
u t a right here . 
and what are you doing ? 
well , i'm , um , going to be certified as an english teacher   teach english as a second language . 
i just got my certification . 
you're kidding . 
oh , that's    , 
the test is a booger .
it's hard . 
it is so hard . 
how are the other ones . 
i haven't taken any of the exit tests . 
see i didn't have to take any other exit test because i've been teaching for quite a while . 
oh , yeah , 
but i've heard they're terrible . 
bilingual is just horrendous . 
i've had friends fail that twice . 
i didn't know any of this . 
none of my friends have failed the english or the education ones .
i really ought to take those quickly while i still remember some . 
right after you get out . 
i know .   .
and they really don't help you a whole lot . 
now see , i went to e t 
and i took one course through t w u 
most of the   training i've got has been through dallas just teaching e s l . 
oh   .
from chapter one tea  . . . 
 and she's expecting the end of this month , 
and she's the only one that lives near by . 
oh , well that will be nice though . 
so the rest live in , 
one lives in connecticut , 
and couple lives in pittsburg , 
and one lives near d . c . 
so , uh  . . . 
but still sort of up in that general 
 so you can probably see them sometimes . 
we see them once in a while , a couple of times a year at least , 
 and the ones in pittsburg , of course , we see more often , 
so , uh  . . . 
all right 
well , uh , what kind of recycling do you have in your area ? 
well , they've been trying different things . 
they don't have anyplace to put some of the things that need recycled . 
right now we've recycled glass for years because we have a glass industry in our community . 
oh , what , 
which one is that ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
so glass has been recycled for a long time . 
uh , we have a  cycling  area set up here at our house , 
the boy scouts and they've done that for years . 
uh , the stores are recycling their plastic bags now . 
you can take them back in 
and they have bins to collect those .
they try to do the , uh , newspapers 
and , uh , they had to close their area down because they couldn't sell it . 
they were , 
what they were doing was shredding it and trying to sell it to farmers for bedding for their animals ,
and that didn't work , 
but somebody told me that they were charging as much for it as they did for straw .
 you know , because the farmers would buy the straw if it's a , you know , similar price . 
and let's see , 
is there anything else . 
i think by this fall it's going to be required that the town of clarion , which we'll live nearby , will have mandatory recycling started 
on just particular things 
uh , mainly the glass , the aluminum , the plastics . 
well , it sounds like they're doing quite a bit . 
well , we're working hard on it because we're fighting also in our area a large hazardous waste incinerator 
and , uh , we would like industry to do more before they build these big , huge incinerators . 
and , uh , they should offer industry some incentives to do more reducing of their waste products and reusing , 
because some of those companies that are doing it save money eventually . 
at first , apparently , it costs more to get started . 
but once they get established , then it's a money saving thing . 
well , our company does some things , all of which i couldn't even tell you about . 
i don't know all of them 
and what is t i ? 
uh , texas instruments . 
oh , okay . 
 yeah  .
my son works for , 
not for that , 
excuse me , go ahead .
well , my son works uh , for the federal government . 
he works in a computer laboratory . 
and he , 
and , uh , it was through him that , uh , 
well , here at work , um , each one of us has two trash baskets in our office 
and one of those is designed for any kind of paper products that , um , they want to use , you know , for recycling . 
they can't deal with every type . 
uh , maybe you could tell me , what is the difference between office paper waste and just like newspapers ? 
well , i guess i don't know specifically , except that , uh , for the paper that they want to recycle , they do not want any newspaper , um , and things like candy wrappers or , uh , that type of thing . 
let's see , 
i have a list here . 
um , they don't want lunch sacks or brown envelopes , uh , phone books . 
so there are , you know , a lot of kinds of things that they don't want , but then any kind of computer paper , letters , uh , booklets , 
they'll even take things that are bound . 
um , and it doesn't all have to be like white . 
they'll take colored folders , 
 oh , really . 
 and , uh , even some of those can have plastic tabs on them . 
so it's hard to kind of figure out , you know , which things are the right ones . 
i mean i'll frequently have to look at the list ,
but , um , they do that 
and then we use , uh , different chemicals and things , 
and i know about how they take care of that sort ,
i don't know all the details , 
 but they're really on top of that . 
and there probably some other things that i don't about because we're a real large company . 
and i just don't have contact with them . 
but in our , uh , city , 
well , i live in a suburb of dallas 
 and they have initiated a newspaper recycling 
uh , all around dallas there are a lot of recycling centers where you can take things , sometimes for money 
 well  it would be inconvenient in other words to , 
very inconvenient , 
and , um , it's you know , hasn't been very practical to get into a lot of those things . 
if they would make it something where they , you know , would pick it up at the curb or at least make it , you know , down the street and at the corner ,
more areas where they would pick it up . 
that wouldn't be so bad . 
um , our grocery store , like yours , will take the , uh , plastic bags 
and they'll also take the paper bags back . 
um , uhhuh . 
but , um , uh , you mentioned the , uh , glass type of stuff . 
the reason i ask you about that is years ago , and um , my dad used to work for knox glass in ,
oh , well , knox is just over the hill here .
oh , really ? 
they were taken over by glass containers years ago , 
 but he worked for them for like thirtyone years . 
oh , for heaven's sake . 
and he used to travel up there to knox quite a bit , 
 and i even did once when i was a child , 
 oh , for heaven's sake . 
 you know , so , 
well , we only live probably about fifteen , twenty miles from knox . 
oh , really ? 
i was looking through our photo album not long ago 
and they had , 
i'll be darn , 
but , uh , i guess that's about it , you know , as far as what goes on that i know about . 
i think people are getting more interested 
and they are more concerned . 
and river . 
and , uh , we just don't want it anyplace .
we feel and more reuse and all those things that could be done . 
we don't think some of the politicians are really interested in our best interests . 
and , uh , you know , have been fighting against this thing in trying to have things changed ,
but , uh , 
well , i think probably more people , you know , would participate if they just made it a little easier , 
 and like you say , make it , um , better for companies to do these things ,
 because obviously ,
 uh , well , 
that's true . 
we've already paid industry for like these super  fund  that's cleaning up . 
we paid industry for it , 
we all help to pay to have them haul it away from their place , 
and where they put it now they found it's not a safe place . 
it's leaked 
and now they have to clean those up , 
and it's our money that's cleaning this ,
that's right . 
and now they want to put it in , 
they burn it 
and that will make another hazardous dump 
 and eventually they'll have to do something with that . 
we'll pay for it again , 
that's true . 
 so why not pay industry . 
this is my feeling . 
why not pay industry a little more ,
also probably look at packaging and ,
we don't need three quarters of ,
but they think , and probably they're right , people buy it  easier  .
i , uh , 
that's their marketing . 
and i know people would be willing to do more , like saving their newspapers and that , if they had a place to take them . 
we don't have anyplace right now that will take them . 
guess our city , you know , in picking them up must take them somewhere else ,
but i don't that it's a big money , 
oh , okay , 
that's right , 
and i , 
but i don't really know . 
oh , yeah . 
do you have , 
go ahead , 
i'm medical . 
that's mine . 
i'm benefits . 
go ahead , you first . 
uh , well , i'll tell you , 
i've been around for quite a few years and worked for a lot of different companies , 
and , uh , it's hard to beat any of the benefits or salaries either ,
i'm quite pleased with it . 
course there's a few things that , uh , i think i could do better if i was sitting up in the c e o's seat 
but , uh 
oh , yeah . 
the one , 
it's kind of like , uh , 
automobile insurance , 
the ones , uh , that i think are the highest and important to me , uh , i hope i never have to use them , really per se , although i've used medical a little bit 
 well that one certainly is high , 
i worry that it's weakening rather than strengthening 
so i like to reverse that trend and say i'd like to get those to strengthen , you know , 
then salary continuance , i've never used that one . 
i hope i never will , 
but that's kind of like an insurance thing . 
i sure like that one . 
oh , yes . 
that's like automobile insurance . 
you never want to get in an accident 
but it , 
you like to have it there . 
well , uh , like i say , i worked for several different companies 
and there's nothing to compare with , uh , t i here . 
now i really got caught up back in eightyfive , 
i got caught up in the oil layoff  , uh , 
i wasn't with g s i , but i was connected with , uh , uh , oil , uh , 
but i say , i wasn't connected with g s i . 
oh , right , 
and , i got caught up in a layoff . 
now , uh , course you get six months , uh , unemployment from the state 
 but , what t i did for us is , uh , i've never heard of it before . they fixed us up with an office with , uh , telephones , access to longdistance , uh , computers , a secretary to take messages for us or type , uh , letters ,
uh , they had out of town newspapers 
and then , 
and outside consultants . 
didn't they have an outside consultant , too ? 
i beg your pardon . 
did they have an outside consultant , like the employ , 
uh , yes . 
uh , course that was not , uh , restricted just to just us . 
but the most important thing was that , uh , they had made up the difference between , uh , unemployment pay and seventyfive percent of my net pay . 
and they then , 
t i paid me that . 
oh , really ? 
so , uh , i was able to , uh , not just exist . 
i mean , i lived just as comfortably as i did before i was laid off . 
they seem to be doing a good job of that . 
i'm in facilities , 
and our organization builds those facilities over in park central now . 
and i guess they've been using them for six months now . 
and i've known several engineers that got laid off 
and they said it's like getting a ph d almost , 
the much they learn over there , you know , after they've been laid off , uh , 
one engineer said it was really an education . 
he just learned , like you , 
he said he learned a tremendous amount that he never would have able to pick up on his own . 
he was very thankful for that , too . 
well , this was not a learning thing by any means . 
it was just uh , 
to have an office , 
well , he said he learned so much 
and how , 
he thought he had a ph d in how to get a job after he was ,
he did eventually get a job . 
well , course i went through this , uh , what , about five years ago . 
they may have improved it considerably . 
yeah , apparently . 
it's very sophisticated . 
and i guess it may be one of the best , uh , that anyone's doing . 
well , that's one of those the handbook , you know . 
you're absolutely right . 
that's a good one . 
what do you think about pensions ? 
anything on that or , 
well , now i have , uh , uh , 
i'm getting close to retirement . 
and , of course i've been looking into it but , uh , since i'm only a yellow badger ,
what do you think of a pension that goes from one company to the other like like a four o one account . 
i've been thinking about that for years , uh , 
i've never heard of such a thing . 
i know . 
that's what i'm saying that pensions , 
you see , just like you're saying , you've only got , uh , so many years , 
uh , yeah . 
uh , it's your account , period . 
it doesn't matter where you go or anything . 
that's your account to roll over . 
that sounds like a hell of an idea . 
i didn't know there was such a thing . 
there isn't . 
what do you think could be better 
and i'm saying that pensions , say in the year two thousand or more when social security goes away , which it probably will , 
i think they ought to have a pension at least that you'd never lose . 
so you work for a company seven years , 
by all means . 
well , what would be the difference between that and social security ? 
uh , well social security's going to go to way , i think 
and or you can invest your own money . 
you have no control over your social security . 
and it's not paid for by the current , 
like when , 
say we retire after the year two thousand , social security's paid for by the twentyfive year olds . 
it's there . 
you don't have to depend on anybody to be putting that money in for you , you know . 
that's just a thought . 
i mean , i , 
if they say which , 
i like the idea . 
course , something like an i r a 
and instead of having a socialized pension , it just would be really money that you and your company , 
maybe you had to put some money in it , too , 
i don't really know . 
but i , 
you don't work for a company twenty years through no fault of your own , you know . 
you work for five , six , seven , 
and y , 
a lot of people i know , guys , 
that's what i've done . 
i've bounced around . 
about every ten years ,
i have , too , 
but not quite that often 
but , uh , yeah , 
uh , i've got , i guess fourteen now here at t i , 
and i hope to make twentyfive which 
say if something happened to me , 
i mean , you know , they lay me off , 
so , you have a pension 
but then you'd have to try to get a pension in another one . 
it would be nice if they could get them together . 
i do worry about medical , though . 
again , knock wood that , uh , i haven't used it . 
i guess you , 
you really do use it throughout the year , because you get your teeth fixed and all that , 
i mean , i , 
but i'm not , 
i'm talking about major items 
i haven't used it for anything major . 
i'm glad it's there , though . 
well , knock wood , 
i haven't used mine for anything major . just doctor visits 
and , well , uh , the h o m a . 
i use h o m a . 
and i like that , uh , a lot better than aetna 
i have the regular . 
again , i just , 
i haven't , 
i can't complain about it because i haven't used it 
and every time i needed it , it's , uh , you know , 
i guess i'm the one just supporting most of the others . 
well , doesn't it work , you don't see , uh , uh , anything until you spend the minimum ? 
don't you have to spend the minimum of two , three hundred ? 
but the dental is right away ,
exams . uh , 
well now , i have the same dental you have . 
the medical you have to have a deductible . 
now , see i don't have a deductible . 
i pay a straight five dollars for anything , a doctor visit or drugs .
well , drugs are okay , 
now , i'm on that , uh , plan , where i take blood pressure medicine . 
if you take an allergy medicine , anything you need a prescription for , for more than six months , you get it for , used to be six bucks , 
they just raised it to twelve . 
oh , that one i haven't heard about . 
that's a typical one that's in there . 
the forms are right in personnel . 
fact , you may be able to take advantage of that . 
it's through baxter labs . uh , 
i have high blood pressure problems myself . 
maybe you still can do that . 
do you buy your pills one at a time ? 
well , turn in your forms . 
go right to personnel . 
i don't know whether you have to about an h m o . 
i don't think so . 
you turn , 
you get your doctor to give you a more than six months prescription 
and , uh , they're twelve dollars , 
again , they just were six , 
they just raised them to twelve this year . twelve dollars for a three months supply .
i don't want to say three months , 
allergy medicine's really , uh , expensive 
and that blood pressure medicine is fairly expensive . 
i take two . 
go right to personnel . 
they got the forms in personnel 
and maybe , 
i just might do that . 
i do it , 
you know , it's a very common thing . 
well thanks , 
it's through baxter labs , 
thanks for the tip , jim . 
i shall look into it . 
what else . 
uh , let's see , 
what other benefits , 
 uh , retirement . 
salary continuation . 
i think that's a great one , 
but again a hope i never use that one . 
that means you're really sick if you have to use that one . 
what about vacation ? 
i'm satisfied with the vacation . 
i don't know what else , you know , 
say you get another week and , 
well , i only got fourteen years 
so i'll get another week when i hit fifteen . 
uh , yeah , 
that's right . 
so that's fair , 
i mean , it's reasonable . 
four weeks is a lot , i think . 
i know some people who have twentyfive years and thirty and they want more 
but , uh , you know , 
well , uh , i'm here , 
i've got just eleven years 
and i don't think i'll ever see a silver badge . 
i won't be around that long . 
well , the way things go , i think i'm going to have to work till i'm seventyfive and , uh , uh , or when i retire get a parttime job , 
so , what do you think of our trial system ? .
huh , i don't really know what to think about it , 
but i do know that they're not , you know , 
they'll give somebody twentyfive years and they'll serve what , eight months . 
have you noticed that ? 
and , uh . 
i don't even know what to do about that sort of thing . 
but i think trial by jury it's a lot better than leaving it up to one person . 
i think trial by jury is very good . 
i actually , 
i think that's actually good idea . 
leaving it up to the judge ? 
oh , okay . 
um , because i think 
well right 
course the judge will know when he'll be up for parole and all that . 
so yeah , 
so he'll be able to give them the maximum sentence , in some cases there . 
but yeah . 
oh yeah , 
but i think if the entire trial was left to one person 
i've got a four year old , 
you can hear . 
oh yes . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
too many people can take vendettas out on people ,
or just , you know , 
there are two people who say well he just looks guilty , um . 
but that's true . 
that's a wonderful way to get off jury duty , you know . 
someone says to you , you know , 
when they ask you uh , if you want to be on , you know , 
when you're called for duty say oh yeah , i want to be on jury duty because i can spot a guilty person a mile a way . 
they quickly let you off jury duty i hear , um . 
because they know that you're biased . 
oh , yeah , 
that's the way it works there , um . 
anyway , i think that probably for having it , 
what you know , about being unanimous . 
i mean , that's sort of a strange case because i wonder what happens when eleven people thinks someone's guilty and one person doesn't , 
one person thinks that they're not guilty 
and they can't decide for hours , unless they convince that one person , you know . 
does it have to be unanimous ? 
well then they consider it a hung jury , i think 
and then they , uh , have a retrial , 
or do they . 
i haven't been to law school . 
me neither . 
so , i don't know much about that , 
i just know that , um . 
i wonder 
'cause sometimes i think about it actually , 
i think well , what if i were that one person and i was completely convinced that this person wasn't guilty , you know . 
well you don't have to be really convinced that he's guilty , 
just if they can't prove he's guilty 
because  , 
right , uh , 
but , i mean what if eleven other people are saying one thing , you know , and you're , 
you know , would you give in . 
 saying  .
i wonder about those things , you know , or even if it's , you know , 
i guess if they were to say , well it doesn't have to be unanimous , 
what's the cut off number , seven , five , you know , six , six , 
you know , how do you decide . 
is it , you know , 
how do you decide what number of people have to say that . 
i know , 
it's too bad one of us don't have some knowledge on this , 
i just hope if i ever go to court that they all , unanimous on not guilty .
well you've seen like these t v movies , 
kyle , i'm talking , 
 but , uh , well how they'll , you know , 
through the whole movie , you think this person's , 
i don't know , 
but one thing that i thought was pretty weird is how somebody can't be uh , excuse me , twice for the same crime . 
i've never quite understood that . um . 
well i just think it's weird because i've saw , well , of course , soap operas , 
i'm an soap opera fanatic . 
this one guy had , uh , framed himself to make it , 
he really did kill the person , 
but then he set it up where it looked like somebody was trying to frame him 
and he was on trial for it , 
and then , you know , it came out that he was being framed , 
so then he was found not guilty , 
and then , th , 
directly after the trial they found out he really was guilty 
and he couldn't be tried again . 
and they can't do anything about it . 
i often wonder about that , 
i wonder if maybe , you know , 
i don't know the law on that 
but if they have new evidence , can they retry , 
or can they , you know , bring you back . 
oh , actually , that's true , 
i've seen the same thing on l a law as well . 
about that woman . 
so and then i wonder why that , you know , 
there must be some sort of deep seeded reason for that , 
the jury or something , 
or , you know . 
and i'm sure that , you know , it's the lawyers ,
i'm sure the prosecuting attorney could make a real good case if he , you know , knew all the details of the defendant's , you know , case . 
of the defense   .
well , well there's also the issue of , for instance , very often you can't , um , 
when someone is on trial for something , you can't bring up prior convictions . 
like if they're on you can't bring up the sexual assaults and stuff , or whatever . 
that's completely beyond me , 
i mean that's jus , 
i know , if it's related , 
i wonder , 
if it's related to the crime , they should be able to . 
i mean if this man is accused of raping someone , then i think that something like sex , you know , 
and i , 
but they're not allowed to do that . 
i never understand , you know , 
again , having , 
i'm sure there are some deep seated reasons , you know , to , 
i mean , often times i wonder about rules like this 
and i'm sure that there are some reasons for good . 
well you're allowed to show their character , 
do you know what i mean . 
and if it shows that their character's , you know , capable of lesser thoughts like that and stuff . 
then right , 
led to that . 
then they should be   
i mean that's what i think , 
um , but i don't quite understand . 
tell you what we need to do is go into law and then we'll be able to , 
or vote . 
do you vote ? .
do i vote ? 
oh yeah , 
we , you'll help out a little bit .
putting the right people in the office , that's a lot to do with it too . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , a lot of the politics will pass laws and stuff that the , um , general public wants , 
so they'll be revoted and all that . 
well that's very true , 
but then again often times they don't , as well . 
they just go , you know , 
you've got people like lame ducks 
and they sort of don't care about anything and just want to go ahead an , 
they , sit on the fence , 
so . well , oh , i talked about this the other day , 
they won't say yes and they won't say no to certain issues just because they don't know what the public wants , or the public's split on it . 
that's true , 
i often , 
i mean , that , 
like you say , that's another discussion , 
but i have had that discussion before as well . 
where you weren't , 
politics of it all , 
because most of it is politics ,
well even in the courts well , well , they're all appointed . 
i mean , 
should judges be appointed , you know , 
or , um , often times i look at friends , 
we had , uh , a serial killer around here , who killed eleven women . 
now was that oh , i don't know , some guy that was attacking women jogging ? 
and choking them , 
well did they have a t v movie about him ? 
i'm not sure if they had one yet , 
but , i'm sure they will . 
um , because he was on some sort of news special though , 
uh , he killed , 
'cause he was just on trial like maybe a year ago . 
well , well , how was he killing the women . 
um , he was strangling some of them . 
were they jogging on a , 
oh , no , 
oh , okay . 
because he was 
actually this is a very sad case . 
the man was let out , 
he was in prison for , um , sexually assaulting two children . 
see , that's what i mean , 
then they let them out 
and then they're able to do it again . 
they let him out 
he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this 
so he came to rochester instead 
and he had killed about between eleven and twelve women , at least 
i think my sister is married to a guy from rochester . 
oh , really , 
way up north here , huh . 
well , uh , i'm originally from kentucky . 
oh , okay . 
still way up north , sort of , um . 
i was up north too . 
but , uh , that's one of the reasons i think judges should be the ones to sentence people 
because they do know , you know , 
won't get out , exactly , 
this man was sentenced to , i think , like three life times . 
but you know , it was just horrible , 
because , um , it was televised and this and that , 
and what they were pleading was , um , they were pleading insanity . 
i mean it's clear to me the man is insane . 
well of course . 
 and he should be just locked up for life . 
 but they just need to do something with him . 
he needs to be annihilated . 
i mean , i don't know what you do with them at that point , if you're that crazy , 
but what struck me is , you know , they had a psychiatrist testifying for hours and hours 
and by the end , i realized that maybe it would have been better if it wouldn't have been a jury of his peers , but if they had a jury of psychiatrists instead , to sort look at it , you know . 
i mean , i don't think it's feasible , 
but , it would be an interesting thought if you're , 
well , it's supposed to be a jury of your peers , 
they couldn't have a bunch of psychotics up there .
or , right , 
but give them a bunch of psychotics but at least have a bunch of psychiatrists ,
i mean , they would    , 
did they have a trial by jury for him . 
what's th , 
huh , well . 
they had a regular trial by jury for him , 
what major changes have affected your life ? 
well , i think that , uh , women working is the one that really affects me most strongly right now . 
well , women in general , and also myself . 
but , um , it used to not really make a difference to me , um , 
or at least i didn't think so . 
but my mother worked , 
and i kind of now wish that she hadn't .
and right now i'm kind of stuck because i'd like to have children , 
but i'm not ready to do that because when i do have children i want to stay home . 
so i'm having to , uh , try to figure out a way to be able to do that . 
and , that's , um , not respected , 
and um , it's not easy to do 
i mean , there's a great deal of sacrifice that has to be made on the part of a family if the wife is going to actually be a mother . 
that's interesting , 
because that relates to the thing that strikes me the most , 
and i'm sure you've labelled the cause , because what strikes me the most in the changes in society is the way kids behave . 
i think that   they have to be related . 
that's right , 
and you know , i mean i was thinking it just , you know , 
my complaint would be , um , that i think that , you know , the kids in the neighborhood run wild , 
and they destroy property , 
and they , you know , steal each other's toys and stuff 
and i guess , you know , when you stop to think of it , these kids have probably been deprived of a lot of attention that they've needed all their lives . 
i think that that's probably true . 
i just wish there was a way , 
i know that you know , in sweden , what they have there , it's really their medical plan , but it also deals with this subject , because if a woman , uh , is working 
but for how many years ? 
i don't know . 
until it , um , 
i'm sure until at least school age , and maybe longer . 
oh , that's great . 
what this does is , it allows the government to subsidize her to be the mother of her children rather than to subsidize child care 
and i think that that's a much , much more viable solution , really . 
i agree , a hundred percent , a hundred percent . 
i guess i was lucky , because i was teaching , 
and so i was able to just go to a class and teach when my son was little , 
and so i'd be gone , you know , an hour and fifteen minutes or something at a stretch . 
oh yeah , 
that's great . 
and , then , yeah , 
very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office 
so . that's an interesting issue though . 
um , yeah 
um , goodness , 
oh , there's been so many , 
how do you just , 
actually a question i would have is , 
i guess i'm being , you know , beyond the age of thinking of this problem . 
i had an argument recently with my boss , 
i think it was , about the need for women to work . 
but i think you put your finger on it , when you said that they're not respected if they don't work , because it seems to me that a lot of people i know , women i know , are doing very menial jobs in a certain sense , certainly financially 
 and , i mean , when i see the amount of clothes that they buy and how much it costs them to buy fast food on the way home 
 and probably you're right . 
i don't see how they could be , especially not if they have to pay for child care . 
well , no , 
even families that don't have child care , 
i mean , you know , when i think of this one friend who makes probably twenty thousand dollars a year , i'm sure she spends at least that in clothes , plus , you know , fast food every day , and out to lunch every day , 
you're probably right . 
if she sat down and looked at it she'd be like , god , what am i doing this for , you know . 
and i mean , you know , even though they don't have children , they have relatives 
and , you know , the husband would certainly like a lot more attention , 
and she wouldn't have to hire somebody to clean the house , and do the gardening .
and , so , i guess you're right . 
our society demands women to work if they're going to be respected . 
really sad .
religion has changed , too . 
oh , that's true . 
um , uh , some people now it seems like are turning back toward actually trying to find out what they're in it for , instead of just , um , 
some places still it seems like it's a social club . 
you know , it's just a place to go , to visit , uh , to wear your nice clothes , and to sit around and talk , 
but , um , i think a lot of people are really , you know , searching now to find out who they are , and who god is , and what all that really means now . 
so that might be a positive change in society . 
oh , um , it's beginning , i think . 
i guess i haven't seen that as much in this area , although every now and then you hear about it . 
uh , but among , you know , people i know , i don't see a great , you know , 
there are those people who have had serious questions all along , and , you know , are sort of pursuing it 
 but , um , the churches here are growing , leaps and bounds , 
and i thought it was more because of the very transient nature of the area 
but , um , it's hard to judge , 
and there are a lot of things changing , i suppose , 
just , you know , the whole environment , i find 
i wonder and the foods we eat , 
and , you know , young people that i know are getting very serious diseases 
oh , yes . 
well , i guess that's always happened . 
maybe not as much as now 
well , it's just , 
maybe it's more unusual now , when , you know , somebody quite young gets certain kinds of cancer , 
and in the past , maybe the same percentage got them , 
but we didn't know it , 
or , i don't know . 
it was nice talking to you . 
nice to talk to you . 
well , do you watch much t v ? 
your kids . 
how many kids do you have ? 
i have four children . 
oh , goodness . 
i have got two . 
that is about all i want .
they are still babies . 
uh , my children like to watch sesame street . 
i watch with them every once in a while , 
but that is not my favorite programs . 
oh , well . we have only get two channels . 
we do not have cable . 
but i am not crazy about t v much . 
it just , 
well it kind of is an idiot box . 
now sesame street is a good program 
i do have that on videotape , 
and i will let him watch that every once in a while . 
and he has learned to count to twenty from that . 
it can be very 
there are shows that i like . 
uh , i like good family shows ,
uh , i let my kids watch things like little house on the prairie . 
and the cosby show uh , is , uh , kind of unrealistic as a family unless you live in upper class and have money . 
i think that sometimes the things they show on there though , uh , 
the problems that their kids get into , are good to , uh , show that they do have problems anyway . 
but they also have a lot easier time disciplining their kids than real people do . 
i mean , like i said , real life is not that easy . 
and , uh , i watch a show that i like for entertainment . 
uh , it is called the quantum leap . 
oh , i love quantum leap . 
i watch that show every time , 
and , uh , 
that he becomes .
he has to do something positive to help them . 
so i , 
he always got to change history is what it is . 
usually , yeah . 
that it is so good . 
i was glad when they put that back on this channel ,
me too , 
and still my little boy , he watches videotapes . 
he won't , um , 
this is terrible , 
i do not like him sitting in front of the t v all day . 
that is not terrible . 
i do not think that is terrible at all . 
but it is a not really a good baby sitter .
it is really not . 
he needs to get outside and play . 
and he is four years old , 
and he just does not like to go out there by himself . 
and i will let him watch the t v when i am wanting to get my house work done . 
but other than that , i do not like him glued to the t v all the time . 
well , i do not think it is healthy all the time either . 
uh , and my kids like to go play with their friends , 
and so i guess i do not mind too much when they do watch a little bit . 
now i , 
there are shows , 
i do not have cable either . 
and there are shows that i really put my foot down on . 
if there starts to be a lot of violence ,
i will not let them watch that . 
well , we made the mis , 
we made the mistake of getting robocop . 
and that is one of the worst , oh , 
i do not let him watch it anymore . because 
i mean it is just real violent . 
i mean , 
well , it , you know , 
today i watched , 
and it is like they show bloody ,
and they show it in slow motion . 
and before , in a western or something , in the olden days , 
they would just fall down . 
and they were gone .
so graphic . 
today it is really graphic . 
they try to make 
too much realism i think ,
i don't , 
now he is watching honey , i shrunk the kids right now . 
oh , that is a fun show . 
it is cute . 
oh , i really 
and that , 
little roger rabbit on before that . 
that is cute . 
and they have got the he man , uh , 
oh , uhhuh . 
that is a real cute show . 
that has good moral values too . 
he man ? 
well , uh , i think , uh , 
good versus evil . 
oh , well , it sounds like we have the same tapes for our kids anyway . 
at least we have the same 
language too . 
language and violence and sexual , you know , 
and i think it is important that i see what they are watching . 
they do have like those parental control things on the , uh , remote controls . you know , where you can block out what channels you do not want them to watch . 
you mean in cable ? 
oh , i do not know , because i do not have that . 
well , my fatherinlaw , and them have that . 
and , uh , they do not have any kids , 
but they was told how to use that . 
but still , when the kids get older , they learn how to break through that parental control . 
oh , do they ? 
they are too smart . 
i think alls you have to do is push a couple buttons . 
so , it is , i am hoping that he will grow up not really caring much for those movies because , now we have got a lot of western tapes . 
josey wells , now he loves to watch josey wells . 
well , i think that is a good show too . 
clint eastwood . 
and like the man from snowy river , we have , oh , 
my husband likes westerns . 
and he also likes star trek . 
now star trek is good movies , good shows . 
the , uh , series ? 
we have got a lot of those . 
uh , i think not even the old one but the new one too . 
i like 
the next generation ? 
my little boy is crazy about captain kirk . 
and my little girl has mister spock's ears .
oh , d ,  , 
 i told my husband he cursed my kids . 
they were both born with pointy ears . 
oh , well . 
not real pointy . 
my little boy grew out of it . 
oh , that is not a problem anyway , 
but it is fun you know , seeing the show anyway . 
uh , now i like , uh , everything mi , oh , 
not michael douglas , um , oh , 
i can't think of his name . 
kirk douglas ? 
oh , michael landon . 
michael landon . 
there you go , michael 
oh , now there , 
i have always liked 
like highway to heaven ? 
here are some cookies , kyle . 
i liked highway to heaven , 
 and i thought that was kind of neat though . 
but i loved little house on the prairie , especially when melissa gilbert grew up . 
she was 
so it is , you know , 
she is about the same age as i am . 
i wanted to be just like her , because she is so cute . 
and i liked that show because it portrayed , i thought , really well , uh , pioneer kind of days .
i liked it , 
but there , 
that is about the only , uh , show i have seen where every time they sit down at the table , they pray 
and i thought that was real neat .
 and , uh , they have this little cartoon that is on sunday mornings with ,
now what is that ? 
i remember him in school , 
but i do not , 
it is just this little dot with arms and feet and little eyes , 
and his parents are there . 
they have it like before one of the church things , 
and it is a just this little dot . 
and he will go out and get himself into trouble and come home , 
and the parents will tell him that there is a verse in the bible that will help him with that , 
oh , i have 
well , it is , 
usually we go to church on sundays . 
but we will miss every once in a while . 
and i will let kyle watch that , 
and he just , 
well , i even like jot . 
i mean i , 
it is funny . 
what channel is it on ? 
it is on channel , 
well , let us see . 
you are in plano ? 
uh , it is twelve or ten down here . 
well , i will look and see . 
we go to church on sunday . 
about one o'clock is when our meetings start . 
and , uh , 
oh , well , this is of the mornings . 
it is in the morning ? 
i think it is before the first baptist in sherman airs . 
i think that is the one that it ,
well , we'll look . 
it is real cute . 
you know what ? 
he is bouncing around , 
and his name is jot , 
and then he has got a friend named cat . 
and i think the dog is the only one that is not a dot .
 but it is real cute . 
and like i say , they teach him stuff from the bible . 
and i think it is just a real cute show . 
i am trying to get my little boy into reading , uh , like church books and things . 
we have got like noah's ark and , oh , lord is my shep . 
we have got about eight or twelve books for him , just little bible stories . 
and they , 
he is getting to where he likes them . 
we got him a little jesus doll , uh , about a year ago , 
and he has always kept that . 
he likes it .
well , i really like , 
now we get channel fiftyfive , although we do not have cable ,
and that is a , uh , 
like , a song , 
they sing songs on there 
but they're , uh , worship through music kind of things . 
but they are up to date , uh , 
and some of them are like , uh , videos 
so it's a , 
oh , that sounds fun . 
the chri , 
it's called the christian music station or something like that . 
that's something . 
and , uh , i really like that . 
uh , i turn that on sunday mornings . 
and i do not , you know , 
and so my kids do not , uh , have an  , 
wow , i don't know what that was . 
what was that ? 
i don't know .
and , uh , to , uh , the brazos river 
oh , yes . 
uh , we have not camped in any of those places , 
in fact it has been a number of years since we have camped , 
but we used to go to tyler state park and , uh , daingerfield 
and in texas that is where we camp basically . uh , 
what are they like ? 
they are very nice . 
tyler is really , really a neat place to camp . 
it has a nice little lake 
and it has some really wonderful , uh , sights that are in the wooded areas . 
uh , the facilities are quite nice 
and our children liked it quite well . 
and you know they , 
we felt real safe with their being able to do what they would like to do there in the area . 
and , uh , it was just a really nice place to camp . 
uh , now daingerfield is , 
let's see , 
i think that's a little bit and maybe south , if i am remembering where that is . 
i think it's a little bit further north , when i think about it . 
at any rate it was very nice as well . 
but tyler , we sort of got spoiled with , i think . 
but , uh , we had lived in michigan before we came here and , uh , had done a lot of camping in michigan , 
i think the upper peninsula of michigan , especially , 
and then also , we had done some camping in colorado , in the mountains , 
so , uh , my parents were real avid campers   
and my husband's parents were really avid campers as well . 
so i guess we just kind of came by it naturally .
do you have a large tent 
and how many does it sleep , uh , comfortably ? 
well , there , well supposedly , 
they always say it sleeps more than it does . 
but they , 
it would have slept three adults anyway . 
well , sort of early on especially as our children got a little bit bigger , uh , we invested in some stacking , uh , cots , you know , that were like bunk beds , 
but they were fold up cots . 
that really gave us a lot more um , floor space and , so , you did not have to be constantly getting things off the floor in order to walk around 
uh , gave us a place to stack things during the day 
so that was real nice . 
but , uh , we , uh , 
like , my inlaws also had a camper , or , uh , a pop up tent , you know , one of those trailer tops 
and those are really nice too . 
a little more , uh , luxurious , so to speak , .
do they have a kitchen in them ? 
it's really nice , 
in fact , it even had a little refrigerator , uh , and the whole business . 
it was quite nice in that respect . 
 uh , and everything was very convenient 
and you did not have the trunk of you car , 
trunk of your car all time , right . 
 and that was nice . 
so , uh , do you have plans for any other camping trips in the near future ? 
or , i like bob sandlin too , 
it's a new park . 
and there is , uh , not really camping , 
but , uh , 
what is it called , cedar hill . 
lake joe pool . 
oh , yes . 
and sometime , i like to go to eisenhower up on lake texoma . 
i have been in that area . 
that is a really pretty state park . 
uh , just , 
we did not camp there , 
but we drove through it just one time when we were in that area 
and it's real lovely . 
it's close to the lake and close to , 
i think it's close to the dam up there 
so it's really quite pretty . 
uh , are you , um , 
let's see what was , 
i was going to ask you something else . 
oh , do you have a favorite among all those that you have been to ? 
oh , from those three , 
uh , is it true that caddo lake is the only natural lake in the state of texas ? 
i would , 
i have never been there 
and i would love to see what it looks like .
it's not very deep . 
and they did build a dam on it , 
but it was there before they built the dam . 
it has been there for a hundred years . 
oh , i see . 
apparently , an earth quake caused it . 
how interesting . 
i guess i never heard the history of that . 
huh , well , that might be some place where my husband and i can go . 
we are talking about starting camping again in the fall . 
um , our children are both grown 
and so , it's just pretty much the two of us who do things . 
and so , uh , we thought we might take some weekend trips and maybe that would be a good place to go to and see what it looks like . 
it's really nice . 
and i don't know , 
spring is probably the busiest time anywhere in texas . 
is it ? 
uh , yeah , 
i think so . 
especially with , uh , uh , 
when the trees start blossoming out and everything it is really very pretty , 
especially in east texas , it's really nice . 
so , uh , well , um , i have enjoyed talking with you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
and , um , have , uh , some happy camping trips .
hope you get to those places you have talked about . 
you too . 
well , okay , 
uh , well , right now we have one dog inside . 
she goes out 
but i mean she's an indoor dog . 
and two outside cats . 
oh , gosh . 
 male and  female . 
and how long have you had them ? 
the ma , 
the dog is probably about thirteen , fourteen years old . 
and the cats they might be as old . 
i'm not sure .
well , that's interesting because we have a simi , 
we don't have cats 
but we do have a dog ,
and she is going to be thirteen this summer 
oh , is that right ? 
what kind of dog do you have ? 
um , she's , um , a mix of cocker spaniel and poodle . 
oh , that's what ours is .
is that right ? 
isn't that interesting  ? 
what color is your dog ? 
oh , well , ours is black , 
so  , 
oh , uhhuh . 
definitely different .
i'll be darned . 
she's a female 
and a really good companion for me . 
and , um , she's slowing down considerably . 
she doesn't hear very well 
she doesn't see very well 
but she's , 
well , that's to be expected at ,
at this age , i guess so . 
but , um , she's been a good dog to have , 
and i don't know , 
once she's gone , i'm not sure if i'll get another animal or not .
well , everybody always says no more .
but i think animals are really important in the family . 
i agree , 
um , did you get yours as a pet for your chil , 
do you have children ? 
uh , yeah , 
oh . well , i was wondering if you got your dog originally as a pet for them or just because you'd had dogs before 
well , a dog before . 
she was fifteen when she died . 
my goodness . 
and , uh , this one , we bought by accident , 
a farmer called us and wanted us to call or the dog catcher or somebody to come and get this puppy that ,
people drop things like that off ,
oh , yeah . 
go get her . 
so that's how we got her ,
isn't that , 
so that often happens that way . 
well , we had , um , intentionally , um , planned to get a dog . 
we had just moved into this house and , um , decided to wait about a year and then went , 
she was in the litter , 
and , um , she was so cute because all the other little puppies in that litter were just crazy . 
i mean , they were all over the place , 
and she was real docile and ,
and i thought ,
she picked us .
so she , 
and it , 
what was funny was that , um , our daughter must have been , 
let's see , 
she must  have been  about eight at the time , i guess , 
and , um , she just loved this little dog ,
but i think she loved her too much because the dog has never been real comfortable with her . 
i think ,
our son , on the other hand , who was about eleven at the time , was , um , not very interested in pets , 
but as it turned out , he and this dog have gotten to be really good pals . 
oh , for heaven's sake . 
so you just never know how that works out .
but they say it's real important for children to have pets because , uh , well , they can go and talk to them any time , 
they want to and tell them anything they want to 
that's right . 
or  , 
they're very ,
oh , dear .
and the nursing homes now , they're finding that it's real important to take a pet into a nursing home . 
i have been reading and seeing about that on television . 
and how , 
our one nursing home in   has one . 
is that right ? 
isn't that amazing ? 
but he goes out   people , 
and real nice dog , uh , 
and , uh , 
it's funny how , um , how pets can kind of , um , oh , take on a certain status in certain areas . 
i mean , um , that made me think of , uh , when our daughter was looking at colleges , we visited a campus in , um , saint louis 
oh , really ? 
what was interesting about it was that they were very friendly , 
but they didn't appear to belong to anyone . 
and , um , 
they were healthy ,
but , um , our guide that day said that around the campus .
is that right ? 
because most campuses don't allow pets ,
i know . 
they just do not allow them . 
i know . 
that's kind of great . 
it really was . 
it was just a nice touch , 
and it kind of made it seem more homey too .
but , um , th , 
i thought that was most unique . 
and it just , you know , kind of goes along with what you were saying ,
um , but , uh , i , 
this is the only pet we've had sin ,
in all our years of marriage , um , 
and it's been , uh , sort of a , a change for my husband because as a boy growing up , his father had dogs 
but they were always hunting dogs , 
oh , uhhuh . 
and so they were never allowed in the house , you know , 
they were always kind of , 
we've ruined them .
 that's what he said . 
they say   ruined them .
so having a pet was a little bit different for him . 
well , we've had a lot of different pets . 
the kids had rabbits for pets , 
and we also raised them for food ,
oh , yes . 
and . e've had a skunk for a pet .
oh , my golly . 
she was in the house .
oh , gosh . 
isn't that interesting ? 
i don't think i've ever talked to anyone who's actually had a skunk for a pet . 
 well , don't ever get one for a pet . 
they're okay , 
but like she , uh , 
they don't ever learn their name . 
uh , you could never call her and she would come to you , 
you had to go chase her down . 
i'll be darned . 
how interesting . 
and , uh , their eyesight , they can't see very far either . 
i guess i've heard that , uhhuh . 
and , uh , they're not .
i mean , they use the litter box . 
that's about it   .
isn't that interesting ? 
that's really something . 
um , how long did you have that ? 
oh , my , how long ? 
probably seven or eight years . 
goodness sake . 
and i don't think she was there a week till the men built her a pen outside .
oh , my gosh . 
isn't that funny ? 
and i thought , i put up with that all those years .
and this is what it took finally .
that is , 
uh , one of them ran off . 
she ran off once , 
or he , i guess it was a male , he ran off twice , 
and the second time he never came back . 
my goodness . 
and we would see him , uh , several miles from our house , 
he kind of moved into a woods down there . 
i'll be . 
and he got huge down there . 
my goodness . 
he really grew 
but he , 
that's in , 
i wouldn't picture a siamese as being an outdoor cat . 
well , he wasn't a whole lot . 
he was in the house most the time , 
but , uh , he did go out sometimes 
and , uh , they ma , 
it makes a much nicer cat if they're outside . 
is that right ? 
the cats , 
my son has a cat , 
and the vet had told us they get strange ,
and their cat was not a friendly cat , 
it was , 
i don't know , 
it got , 
it did get strange .
so that was right . 
and since they've moved to where they let the cat out . 
and it has improved the personality . 
americans like me 
and whether i night , uh , uh , not , 
i think that we're paying too much taxes . um , including taxes in general or income tax , 
go by ear , 
okay , um , 
well i can just tell you a little bit about taxes in texas . 
it's most interesting because we're one of the few , if , 
i don't know of any other state , um , does not have a state income tax 
 so we don't have a state income tax , 
but we certainly make up for it in other ways here . 
um , for instance , the local , um , sales tax is eight and a quarter percent . 
oh , wow . 
isn't that awful .
how about you ? 
what do you have there ? 
uh we have a six percent 
and you have state income tax also ? 
well , it's been , 
people here have this , um , 
they've been really holding out in the legislature , 
and it's starting to show , um , in a lot of ways as far as things that are just totally under funded , 
to , um , totally avoid having an income tax or not . 
i think eventually they're going to have to do it 
 but , um . do you think you pay too much there , 
or how do you feel about that ? 
i don't mind my taxes as much as my social security . 
oh , really 
um , the taxes , 
i don't know , 
i can deal with that because i know everyone else is paying in too , i guess 
but , uh , oh , i don't know , uh , 
the one thing that , 
we don't have , uh , tax on clothes 
um , yes 
that's what i thought . 
i know new york also has a sales tax on clothes 
 and i know a lot of kids , like going to college with me , that lived in new york or out of state , a lot of them would buy their clothes in pennsylvania just for the simple sake of not paying that , 
how interesting . 
i guess i didn't realize that . 
um , we don't have tax on groceries , for instance , uh , 
well , we don't have it necessarily on food , 
but then there's other things that they nail you for it 
i should have , um , delineated , 
yet , your absolutely right . 
it's the consumable food parts that , you know , we don't have to pay 
and you really have to watch your , um , bill . 
sometimes i think , um , it's real interesting to look to see how many things that i buy in a grocery store which are not really edible groceries .
and that's when it really starts to add on , 
that is sort of a help , 
but , um , i don't know , 
it's just eight and a quarter just seems like an awfully lot of tax on uh , any sale , as far as i'm concerned , um , 
that    , 
it's real interesting , this last , um , tax season , 
i'm a student , 
and the last tax season i had just a part time job helping out in a tax office . 
and the woman that owned the office was saying , she'd had this business for oh , probably seventeen or eighteen years , 
and she was saying as the years have gone on , there are fewer and fewer things that people can , uh , take off of their income tax . 
deduct , yeah . 
and , you know , if you're not a home owner , or if you haven't sold property , or , uh , have something major like that , you know 
and she said it's really taken the fun out of doing taxes for people for her , because she used to be real creative about helping them 
and see , 
i take it she was an accountant . 
oh , really 
i know , 
well , i also was a student , 
i just graduated in may 
 and , um , i graduated with a finance degree , 
but that was the big joke , the accountants or the people who found ways to cheat on your income tax . 
where did you go to school ? 
clarion university . 
well , you are the same age as my daughter , because she just graduated from college this year too . 
i'm a graduate student having gone back after many years . 
um , nevertheless , i am a student , and poor .
so , uh , um , you know , it's been , 
i guess , as far as people like , uh , our family , we can feel like sometimes we pay more than our share as middle class americans with 
i don't know , 
i guess as you say , you just have to look around and decide that most of the other people that you know are paying about what 
i think they should go back , 
i realize , you know , that we have , uh , graduated tax brackets , 
but i think they should still go back 
and instead of putting the burden more on the middle class , i think the burden should be put more on the wealthy . 
oh , yes . 
because it seems like , they still come out okay 
 you know , they always have the argument , well , you know , well who's to say we don't work harder to get that 
i kind of have my doubts .
you're still going to be above , on top , 
and i , 
you now 
like you said , i've worked in different places , 
and the ones that get the most pay do the least work . 
that the higher they get , the , you know , 
at least , 
i don't know , 
it seems like , um , they must feel like they're paid for all of the years of experience um , or something , or just the title , sometimes 
and it doesn't seem fair , 
and in good investments and things like that , 
but i think that's a lot of luck and a lot of gambling , and not a whole lot of work .
i agree with you . 
i do think it's a lot of luck , 
and i don't like that part of the finance , you know 
i don't know , 
but like what i was saying about the social security , that's real , you know , 
it never bothered me until we started talking about it in my classes 
 and then the more i think about it , the more i think , i'm paying in to something that i , 
granted , you know , i'm paying for my grandparents 
 but i'm never going to see that . 
probably not . 
social security is going to be gone before i ever get any . 
or what's left is not going to be worth anything 
they're going to pay me
but that's , 
well , and , 
i'm sorry , 
i put in much more than that , you know . 
that's right , 
i haven't heard much in recent years , um , about social security , 
i mean , for a while there , not too long ago , they were saying that the whole system was going to be bankrupt 
 and then , um , i , 
it sort of calmed down . 
i haven't heard much lately , 
but if you have talked about that in your classes , you know , in the last few years , i'm sure that you have heard , 
oh , yeah . 
well , um , i don't know , 
i guess we complain about taxes , 
but , i guess , you know , 
you got to look to what they put , you know 
you have to 
you have decent roads at least .
 and , um , i guess it's worse , you know , 
i'd rather be able to control my money as much as i do with what's left over 
that's true . 
 and , so , you know , i guess it's all relative , 
it's how you look at it too . 
that's exactly right . 
i like to , 
instead of thinking how much , you know , that i'm paying out , i like to just look at it and say oh , well everyone else is doing it too , you know . 
that's right , 
and i , 
my name's mary dell , 
and i live in the dallas , texas area where there's a lot of pollution .
and i'm up in wisconsin 
 uh , my name is terry 
 and , uh , in the small town we don't , 
but , uh , we're not that far from the city where there's tons of pollution . 
i'll go ahead and start recording that , 
 okay , um , 
just in particular here in the twin cities we have a lot of big corporations 
and , um 
we , uh , 
before moving to wisconsin lived across from where they were , um , gravel pits 
and so we occasionally if the wind was blowing the right direction would get the smell of tar 
smell the continuous , 
you knew that you were also breathing that into your lungs , 
but just the idea of having that come across the way it did in the wind 
and that was just one small corporation that was doing the pollution of that , 
so got a lot of fumes from , uh , trucks 
and you would literally see the pollution on your furniture , 
i mean , it was 
oh , gosh , 
you would dust every day , 
and it was dirty , um , type of dust , 
i mean , it wasn't the typical dust that you get way out in the country 
i live in a small , um , town now quite a ways from the twin cities , about an hour away , 
and i may dust once a week , 
and that's all it needs versus every day when i lived in the city 
i have to dust a lot as well . 
oh , yeah , 
the only way that you could actually live in the city is to close your windows and have an air cleaner system right in your home 
my goodness . 
 and so it was quite a dirty city . 
um , if you were well protected by trees , which catch a lot of the pollution 
but most of the time in the city you have lots of high rises , you have lots of other things that are not catching the pollution 
and it's just going 
and it's landing somewhere with the wind , 
that's kind of the way dallas is . 
we're so flat and open , 
and i live in a suburb that doesn't have much vegetation , trees 
it was all cotton fields , 
and ours i think is primarily cars , where we don't carpool like we should 
i work in a building , 
i'm nineteen floors up 
 and i look out toward d f w international , 
and there's just an awful brown haze all the time 
 and i can imagine it's even worse for people living over near the airport . 
oh , sure , 
i mean , our air quality , um , in the twin cities is a lot better than what we've heard about california and 
but , um , they were always talking about the air quality of today is this , you know , the ozone or whatever , 
and it's kind of scary because the air is something we take for granted 
 and many people are too busy getting to work , not thinking about , okay , i could have carpooled with a friend , 
now he's , uh , fifteen miles away from work , 
but he was talking , wouldn't it be nice to carpool , 
it wouldn't pay 
 and , so . 
it would save quite a bit on the wear and tear on cars 
and , no , 
everybody has their preference to drive by themselves 
or , if they do , they drive with one little buddy , uh , 
at least it's with one person 
i don't want to carpool , 
it's too much of a hassle , 
it's too much involvement 
but we're 
 but yet , 
we are , 
and i think of my daughter 
and i'm sure you think of your children , 
and you kind of say to yourself , what kind of future will they have when they think back and say , well , my parents did have the choice to kind of make a difference 
 and maybe people are trying , 
but they have to change attitudes , 
and it seems to me that it's already so evident with our children having a lot more respiratory infections 
i had a chance to go to bolivia a couple years ago , 
and of course there's no industry , very little trash , 
well , they , 
and it amazed me , 
i just had totally forgotten how  . . . 
 uh , the only work i do outside the home is i am an avon representative . 
oh , okay . 
and i sell family products . 
and , uh , 
do you , 
so i don't really dress up a whole lot . 
do you work outside ? 
i'm a c p a 
and i do contract work . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and i work with another c p a who just started his own practice 
 and i work with him a couple days a week 
 and so when i go to his office or to other clients' offices , then i'll dress up 
 but otherwise it's great being at home 
so that makes it pretty nice . 
and , uh , it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day , just about . 
well , you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day , i think . 
and so it's , uh , 
some of my suits i haven't put on for quite a 
so it's , 
it's kind of nice to relax a little bit . 
well , my dress up , 
i live out in the country also 
uh , so i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up . 
but , i try to dress nice , but for convenience , because when the weather's bad , when i go into the home i take off my shoes 
and i don't too often take off my coat even , 
well , i imagine that where you live , uh , you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year . 
not really ? 
oh , is that right ? 
course , they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more florida type weather up here  , 
so i 
but for now , 
so you all are waiting for that .
now , my daughter works all the time , 
so she dresses . 
i think , you know , you have to spend more money on your clothing , and that 
well , down here it's sunny most of the time .
i mean , we had a few cool days , uh , this month , 
but not anything , i'm sure , compared to what you've had so far . 
um , uhhuh . 
so , i mean people are still wearing shorts 
but , that lasts , you know , for a few months .
did you find you wore , uh , slacks when you were working full time 
or 
no slacks . 
i think it was one of those things where , it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them . 
it was one of those understood things 
not even slack suit even 
most people didn't . 
sometimes , like the secretaries might 
 but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much . 
and i really , you know , 
there's some nice pantsuits out 
 but , uh , 
i know my daughter mostly , 
i don't think she ever wears slacks 
but i didn't know if the trend changes , you know , if , uh , 
you know , i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional . 
i guess they 
look more like a woman , huh .
and it's the men that make the rules .
uh , well , then you know why they make them then  ,
we usually , you know , 
skirt and blouse or suit or dress 
so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants . 
no one can see me 
but , yet , you need to keep up an appearance for your husband , too , though 
but , i'm not going to put a skirt on just for him .
well , you'll be excused because considering everything .
i think that the main issue at home 
but i look at homemaking as a job also .
and i think sometimes we lose sight of that .
what do you do there in lubbock as far as , uh , recycling is concerned ? 
well , you know they actually started 
and i assumed it was t i wide , uh , 
they started putting out at least recycling bins for the paper 
 uh , i've you know 
either computer paper or different types of paper . 
i've had some ideas on how i think they could probably do it a little less expensively and accomplish the same purpose , 
but i guess i need to put it on paper and turn it in .
oh , yeah . 
well , you know , they have boxes located at certain areas throughout a module , or down the hall 
you know , where i use to work we had what we called tree boxes . 
that's just what we called them . 
and they were recycled cardboard . 
they were eight and a half by eleven 
and you set it by your desk and you know as you got rid of a piece of paper you stuck it in there 
and when it filled up you called , you know facilities whoever to come pick it up 
and they brought you another box . 
so not only is it , you know , 
i think more people would take advantage of it and use it , uh , 
i think you save a lot of the cleaning service's time and effort and money that we are paying for them to empty the trash cans and combine it and bundle it and things like that now when it could all be done in one step 
i see . 
i , uh , was going to say cause i know i have right here a trash can for trash and a trash can for for paper on it 
and , uh , 
but somebody still has to collect all that 
that's true . 
and whereas if you had a box that pretty soon it got full , you close the box , it's already bundled , it's already done for you . 
certainly that's a good idea . 
 so you're saving a lot of time and effort . 
i just need to put it on paper and 
so , uh , what else do they do in the dallas area ? 
well , uh , as far as t i is concerned , i'm not sure . 
uh , and i have heard , you know , uh , in residential situations . 
i live in a dorm 
and i have heard in residential situations , uh , like in plano 
and , uh , the only responsibility of the , patron is to separate them 
and then the , 
uh , i guess the department takes them and does what they do with them 
and it doesn't cost the patron anything . 
doesn't really cost the , uh , department . 
anything extra . 
they don't pay for the recycled items . 
that sounds good . 
you know you can throw cans in one or the glass in the other 
or the even , uh , 
there are areas that can recycle the tin cans , like your 
i've not done that , 
but that's kind of what i want to set up because we do go through aluminum cans , you know . 
that's probably the one we use most . 
uh , but , 
well , what kind of services do you have there in lubbock as far as , 
i lived in abilene for a , uh , 
i went to school there at abilene christian 
and i , 
it was so hard to , uh , 
 you know if you 
find a place . 
 well , uh , uh they do have facilities for recycling the newspapers , aluminum cans , those are the two major items . 
you know , we can take oil , like car oil , recycled oil to , 
they have , uh , uh , dump areas like at the fire departments 
uh , i don't know that they yet have the facilities here to do the tin cans . 
uh , i think they can do the plastics , like the liter bottles 
uh , but , i don't know . 
i know for sure though they have the newspaper and the aluminum can and then the oil at the fire departments . 
well , that's good . 
i do that 
i think people are becoming more aware .
and you know i like to see , you know , 
you drive through burger king now and the bags are recycled paper 
 you know , so , you know i feel like people are more aware of it or becoming more aware of it . 
you know , maybe it's making an impact .
do you tend to buy more recycled items uh , the pack says recycled and something else doesn't ? 
would you tend to chose the one that does 
 but if i am there and the choice is there 
so , you know , that's just where i probably need to be a little more responsible , citizen wise , you know , looking or searching those out because you figure if we as the citizens do that then the manufactures and producers will start packaging it that way . 
so , uh , you know , they are getting away from the styrofoam , 
um , uh , well , give me your first impressions . 
uh , i don't know , 
there's a lot of air pollution . 
um , i think industries and companies provide a lot of it 
 and , uh , i guess with the oil burning over in kuwait and stuff , that would have a lot of air pollution in it . 
uh , puts a whole , 
gets a whole new picture to what real air pollution can be , 
but , uh , that stuff going on over there . 
uh , what part of pennsylvania are you in ? 
um , i'm north of pittsburgh , 
so , uh , just in a little different grade , i guess . 
but , uh , in dallas , we've just , uh , brought in a whole new set of requirements on inspections and things like that for cars , because , uh , people just don't use mass transit and stuff in dallas . 
everybody loves their car , 
and you see an awful lot of , uh , one person vehicles on the road during rush hours . 
that seems to be our biggest problem down here . 
um , you know , uh , there's a lot of industry around , 
but , uh , it's 
any pollution that industry's dumping around here is not going into the air . 
it's typically water type situation . 
um . we have like a steel mill and a couple refineries and stuff , 
and i know there's a lot of air pollution going in there , 
and like they get fined whenever they do the air pollution 
 but the fine is nothing , you know , 
it's like nothing to them . 
that's true , 
 uh , i grew up in south dakota , 
so i was never exposed 
um , there were always e p a people and what not were always telling us that , uh , farm chemicals and what not were destroying our water system and all that 
 but we just never saw the results . 
there was dust in the air during planting seasons and what not , 
but that was all we ever saw , 
and then five years ago i moved to dallas , 
and i suddenly started to understand what burning eyes , and all that stuff is about that i'd always heard about . 
it's real depressing . 
in the morning sometime you can tell if it's a good day or a bad day by , uh , how far out from downtown , uh , you can be on the road and still not see it . 
oh , my god .
 and , uh , yeah , 
i mean , it's not , 
i don't think dallas is considered , uh , a real bad place for air pollution , 
but , a foggy , misty color 
 and , uh , it's a little disappointing sometimes you start to realize what you're breathing . 
uh , yeah , 
but , i don't know what they can do to really prevent it , you know . 
like , how , 
what can they do about the oil burning over in kuwait ? 
what , you know , 
i mean they fine the industries , 
but you know , that doesn't seem to stop them there 
i don't know what else they can do . 
it's that there really isn't a whole lot . 
every little bit does help , 
i do believe that . 
um , but i also believe that the earth is a kind of a selfregulating system , 
and , uh , it will clean itself up , eventually . 
the whole idea is not to push the limit too hard , i guess 
natural systems take care of the problem as much as possible . 
i just don't understand , you know , what else anyone can do about it . 
i don't think it's something that people really think about , either . 
you know , it's doing a lot of damage , 
but i , 
it's something , you know , 
i don't think many people really think about it , because it's nothing they , 
i don't think we really have too much control over it . 
and it's one of those things , 
what the damage is 
 it's kind of like , oh , 
i guess it's kind of like cigarette smoking , you know . 
doing some damage 
um , you know , there's a lot of things like that . 
uh , you can pound on something for a long time before it finally breaks , 
but until it breaks , you don't really know that you were doing anything to it . 
but , uh , 
well , i really don't know too much else about it . 
well , that's , 
i think we both agree it's one of those deals that , uh , 
i just think there's a lot of other problems right now 
 and , uh , we've done a lot to take care of it . 
and , uh , 
we have tried , 
i mean , you know , and , um , you know , where a couple of the mills that have , 
i know they put things on their stacks , you know , to filter the smoke , and do all kinds of things , 
but , i mean , every now and then it breaks , you know , 
oh , sure . 
we have tried to help . 
oh , there's no doubt about it . 
i don't know if you ever happened to see some of the like , twenty twenty and what not about rumania and east germany when they first got pictures out of there 
 and , uh , you know , they had absolutely no regulations , no controls whatsoever , 
and they had destroyed entire forests and what not , just because the air was so polluted . 
that's the kind of things that , uh , you don't see in this country , 
and that's why i think that , you know , it's , 
i don't know if you can ever do enough , 
but , uh , i think it's all relative to the time and place , 
and i think right now it's pretty much under control . 
all righty . 
it's been nice talking to you . 
well , you bet . 
well amy it's been , uh , kind of overcast today and cloudy . 
we have , 
i have a son in kindergarten , 
he was having a kite day , 
oh , boy . 
and i was really worried about it raining because there's been some dark clouds 
um , and it's been pretty rainy 
i've been trying to put weed spray on the lawn for the whole week 
and you can't put it on if it's suppose to rain within fortyeight hours , 
and so i keep hearing the forecast it's going to rain , it's going to rain , it's going to rain , 
but it really hasn't rained .
i know it just 
i know . 
it looks , 
several times in the last couple of weeks it has looked rainy that day 
and we have a lot of trees in our yard 
and i probably , 
they're pretty old , big tall trees , 
 well , i get tired with the ki , 
i have two preschoolers , a three year old and a two year old , 
and if it's not nice and they can't go out , it's really the pits .
oh , i bet . 
but i appreciate it when they can at least go play in the backyard for an hour or something , you know . 
that makes a big difference 
 but i , uh , 
we're kind of new to plano 
and i'm working on a carnival that's going to be in a couple of weeks for our school 
and i'm thinking that this has been pretty , you know , rainy season , 
and it's been kind of scary , 
it's kind of been cloudy every day , 
and  ,
well , my three and half year old , he really wants  , you know 
well , yeah . 
i mean all winter long he's been wanting a pool in the backyard . 
so , i'm hoping , you know , that , 
it just seems like the weather around here goes so quickly from being winter to , you know , muggy , and hot , 
and it's just you never really have like nice cool sixtyfive or seventy degree weather with sunshine 
i really miss that , 
i'm from chicago originally , 
and i miss the   seasons you know , that we used to get up there that you just don't have down here . 
well , i know in , um , 
i'm from missouri 
and we always had pretty nice four seasons 
and you know , ex , 
we have some extreme weather in each season , 
but , uh , i like that 
and we moved here from houston in , uh , july 
it's not going to be so humid , 
that has just not been the case . 
oh , really 
it's pretty hot here during the summer 
i thought i was going to die , 
my car , i thought it was going die last summer 
do have air conditioning in your car 
well , the air conditioning was broke , 
but broken , 
i guess it just couldn't handle ,
and , you know , i was worried about every time we came to an intersection 
i know , my husband doesn't have air conditioning in his car and when he comes home from work , you know , during the summer 
oh , i know . 
that's really awful , 
but i , uh , understand that this is kind of typical for this time of year 
what i hate is , 
i hate having to water so much around here 
we never used to have to water our lawns 
 you know in chicago it was always enough rain here and there 
 so here if you don't water it just looks awful . 
i just hate to spend the money just going down the drain and watering grass , you know . 
it takes time 
and the kids , they , 
you have to water your lawn 
and they want to go out and run in it and get all muddy ,
so you're going do i want a green lawn or a muddy feet  ,
we have a dog too 
so that adds to it 
oh , no .
well , i don't know , 
the nice thing i'm looking forward to is , uh , not having a hurricane season . 
oh , yeah , 
weren't there a lot of hurricanes there ? 
and they're close enough to the coast 
and , you know , you had to have a supply like , uh , emergency supply on hand all the time 
oh , boy . 
that would be , 
keep the weather radio close by and stuff like that ? 
and do we have enough , you know , um , food storage , and enough , uh , batteries and 
really , every time i store batteries , i wind up going to use them and they're dead 
they've been stored so long . 
that's right . 
well , now this is a little bit of relief , although they still have warnings all the time around here for , you know , tornado season 
but , uh , at least there isn't , 
i feel like i got rid of something , 
well , i've been worried about mostly with having little kids now with taking them out in the summer and getting them burnt up , 
i mean i have to keep the sun screen on them just constantly when they go outside 
and , the record temperatures that 
a hundred and ten degrees 
oh , it was just unbelievably hot . 
and i can't stand to be outside at all when it's like that , 
i just don't even want to go out , you know , of the house to get the mail even  , 
leave me in the air conditioning . 
that is pretty bad . 
we had our air conditioning  , last summer . 
the switch got something wrong with the switch 
and we had to call somebody out to fix it , because i couldn't take it more than a few hours without it on . 
oh , i know . 
i can't imagine . 
well , that would , 
it is just pretty bad , 
but um , i guess the weather hasn't changed too much from here to houston 
like you say coming a little bit further up north .
that's really nice 
i hate having to leave the house you know , closed up all the time . 
and get some fresh air in the house 
and , it feels good 
well , have you been here during the real heavy , heavy rains ? 
i mean i can't remember what time of year , 
i think it's usually this time of year when we get some , just torrential down pours . 
 but i 
our neighbors had flooding ,
oh , no . 
they had to replace all their carpeting and everything , 
it was miserable . 
now , that sounds awful . 
that would not be fun . 
now , i have seen those . 
i have driven around in the neighborhoods and seen those little flood gauges 
it's , you know , has it like from one foot to four foot 
and i thought i would never buy a house 
 oh , really . 
oh , gosh , 
no kidding . 
talk about asking for trouble , huh ? 
that would be awful . 
well , i've got some kids out on the trampoline i need to go look and see what they're doing . 
well , have a good day . 
well , you too . 
so , what is your latest experience with painting ? 
i don't , 
i haven't done any painting since i was a child 
and my father would be painting and i'd ask him if i could , take a turn or something , 
but , uh , 
when we bought our home updated . 
they did that , maybe improvements , so they could sell it and things , 
so we didn't have to do any painting . 
and the condominium we moved in before , my husband went over and painted , 
but i , 
the experience that i've had is that , um , whatever time he just about four hours ,
and he said , oh , it's going to be just about four hours . 
well , he was gone the whole day , 
isn't that amazing ? 
it looks so easy just slapping paint on . 
i had an addition put on 
 and , so i decided , okay , i'll just , you know , have them paint this little room , you know , a little ten by ten dining area . 
it took four days . 
 and even the painter couldn't give me a good estimate . 
he said , well , i'll be done this afternoon , you know 
 and pretty soon , before you know it , you know , he's run into so many problems , 
and it's just , 
there's nothing there to be a problem i thought , 
but , um , it just took him so much longer , 
um , and if you've ever painted french doors , which my husband just finally said he wasn't going to do  ,
um , then just  , 
we got this painter , 
and i just called him because i got a little ad out of you know , the  adcose  or whatever in the mail , and , uh , you know , just got this painter person over here . 
oh , i know , 
it's just awful . 
how much , you know , more do you know than i know about this whole situation , 
but he just kept painting on those french doors , you know , 
and each little , um 
so he had to redo them like three times before i was happy with them , before he was happy , you know , that they even looked halfway decent , 
i mean , hire a professional , 
but that doesn't guarantee anything .
and it really , 
like you said , always takes is able to guess , because i know my husband he painted , when he , 
it was just the preparation time was so long .
at night because we were trying to hurry up and get it ready so we could move in , 
he had finished one can off and started another one . 
oh , no . 
 and then we went in there , you know , one was , bu , 
they were white , 
but one had more blue to it . 
oh , and that can make a difference ,
i mean , and they bring the , uh , you know , little samples 
 and you've got like maybe , five hundred , 
well that's an exaggeration , 
but there are just so many tints upon tints upon tints , 
and you don't know what you to want to ,
and by the time it's on , i 
selected what i thought was white , 
and it was like you said , you know , it was 
and it looked awful on .
so that was the next problem . 
he had to redo that too . 
i  , 
this was a , 
and it was a major project getting the money together to do it too , by the end ,
but , you know , we worked something out , because he was kind of apologetic that it took so long . 
he really came over here to paint , i think , because he kept offering to paint the outside of my house  , 
i don't think he did the interiors very well .
oh , boy . 
 and , yeah . 
well , i don't recall my parents having that much trouble .
i mean , you know , they painted our rooms all the time , 
 and we had a wooden , 
we hardly , 
we just had brick on like as accent 
and so he had to paint the outside all the time . 
it wasn't a big deal for them . 
i don't know . 
but to us , you know , 
we're going , oh , we're so glad we have a brick home , all we have is like trim around the windows or something , 
i think my husband's really glad about that .
for sure . 
i don't know that w , 
 say , we're freshly graduated from school and things , 
so we haven't gotten to the point where we're of our needs . 
you just get in there and do it yourself . 
we've been trying , 
you know , we've done that the whole time we were in school . like ,
well , it's not that easy . 
it's like , it's , uh , 
i don't even know if you know , i would not even recommend this person again to anybody . 
i don't know . 
i guess you ge , 
i don't know if you get into the mind set where you just say , well , i'll accept something , or you just really have to get on their back , i mean , 
i mean , 
i tell you what , the fumes that the paint gives off makes you wonder what these people do any , 
that's true . 
i mean the fumes are amazing , 
and i don't think i could stay sane ,
so , i mean , i know it's not lead based any more , paints , 
but , still ,
and they have to live with that every day 
well , yeah , 
oh , it does . 
the only painting job that was really damage . 
there was a roof leak , 
and that was not something that we had to pay for . 
so they sent their painters in to repaint a corner of the ceiling and then , you know , repaint the whole ceiling ,
they came in and did it and left in just no time at all , 
and i think it's because you know , they were accustomed to working in that environment , in those particular condominiums , 
 and i didn't watch them , 
but i couldn't imagine that they came in and painted it , the whole ceiling , you know , just within a couple of hours . 
and , uh  , 
well , maybe there are some professionals out there .
it makes you wonder .
really , it does ,
well , um , i hope you have a nice day today . 
 well , you too , 
and you take care . 
i guess it's getting to be lunch time , 
i need to go take care of the kids 
you have a good day . 
bye , kay . 
well a lot of women are as knowledge about football as i am . 
can i guess your favorite team , if you had one , might be the steelers . 
well , i can understand that . 
you know , i kind of like the cowboys , too . 
do you ? 
dallas and pittsburgh together .
me too . 
it wasn't nearly as much fun when bradshaw was playing for you guys , i'll tell you . 
he lives in the dallas area now , as a matter of fact . 
does he really ? 
well , actually , it's probably closer to fort worth , 
but it's in the same area . 
he uh , bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke , texas . 
but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often . 
as a matter of fact , there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job . 
oh , wo , 
i wonder if he'd ever do that . 
i don't know , 
he'd be good at it . 
he's such a motivator , 
that would be his specialty . 
i wished they could work something , 
i really like him . 
well what about the houston oilers . 
do you like them ? 
i'd love to see dallas and houston play in a super bowl . 
that would be really great . 
that may not ever happen , 
i don't know . 
 uh , houston has had some wonderful talent , you know , down through the years 
and in the earlier years they really had some super teams . 
and warren moon ,
that's right . 
he certainly is , 
he's very good . 
he's one of the few , uh , black quarterbacks that there are . 
that's right . 
randall cunningham was with philadelphia , i guess last year , 
but he's no longer with the team . 
 so , you're right , 
there are very few black quarterbacks , or at least that are starting anyway . 
how do you think the steelers are going to do this year . 
you have any idea . 
i don't know , 
i hope they do better . 
during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better . 
but , uh , a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential ,
oh , yeah , 
that was just such super team . 
or , if they even reach that potential again , you know , they may never reach that again . 
well that's a tough , 
it would be tough to do , 
they have such a super team for years , that won what , four super bowls ? 
i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not . 
oh , i don't know . 
shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying . 
that's right .
but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now , 
that's right . 
i think mike webster was left 
but then he just left . 
he may have been the last of the old guard , 
i don't know . 
i think he is , 
i think he was . 
they had such a super team . 
have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday ? 
i see . 
there's quite a bit of activity now , 
of course they had so many , you know , nice , uh , choices because their record was so lousy the last few years . 
they picked up ,
of course you never know . 
the guys they pick , you know , may never play a game . 
you never know , 
it's a gamble , 
it really is . 
they may get hurt , or , not be able to participate at that level , if you know , 
well who would you say is your favorite player , or has ever been your favorite player ? 
ever been ? 
probably an old guy that played , probably before you were born  , 
his name was sam huff . 
he used to play for the new york giants . 
that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life ,
he just went all out every single play . 
of course , there have been some other great ones too , dick butkis , and bradshaw , you know , 
there's been so many . 
but if i had to pick one , i would probably pick sam huff , as a matter of fact . 
oh , you know , that's really funny , um , 
well , i come from a large family 
and , there's quite a few boys 
so that's kind of how i got in with the football . 
either watch that or watch nothing . 
that's right . 
and , um , at one time i could name all the players on the steelers , you know . 
i didn't particularly care for him , 
i thought he was kind of cocky or something . 
he is , 
of course a quarterback has a big ego . 
they have to have , 
they can't survive . 
they always think they can win , you know , which is the way it should be . 
boy , he never gave up , i'll tell you . 
him and franco harris , 
i really didn't care for the either two of them . 
 i mean they were good , 
but , i , you know , you couldn't deny that . 
 oh yeah . 
 but you know , well i just didn't really care for either one of them . 
uh , today , my favorites out of those guys were probably , um , lambert ,
i can't disagree with that . 
they were super players , 
they really were . 
they really , 
the best plays from , 
highlights , yeah . 
i love watching that . 
then i like watching their bloopers too , you know .
that's kind of funny too , as a matter of fact .
some of them a bit embarrassing . 
well they make mistakes too , i guess . 
it's funny that more people don't get hurt .
oh they , 
oh , yeah , 
it's funny some of their necks don't get broken . 
i don't know how they do it . 
it must just take a hundred percent concentration , i guess , because they know they're going to get hit , 
it's just a matter of how hard , you know , or where . 
an they have to be in ideal physical shape , basically . 
oh , absolutely . 
they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem . 
gosh , what a beating , 
they really do take a beating , 
well what did you think of , um . a couple years ago for the bears , the refrigerator . 
i think he was just probably a passing phenomena , i think .
i don't know , 
knowing what , you know , 
of course , mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach , or , you know , knowing of his temperament , i'm just surprised he ever , you know , kept the guy around , 
i really am . 
he's about a half hot head anyway , such a temper . 
oh , you know , and to me um , oh , he's just so big and fat , 
he doesn't even look like he's in shape . 
he's just so big , no one can move him . 
that's right , yeah , 
there's just so much mass there , i guess they just can't , 
i don't know , you know , 
the guy is , you know , probably physically strong . 
i , you know , 
obviously not very fast . 
but i guess it's just , like you say , a mass that nobody can seem to get out of the way . 
as far as him scoring touch downs , you know , i think that was kind of weird . 
i don't know , 
dallas has a guy , uh , his name is nate newton , 
now he has a real weight problem too . 
he fights it every single year , 
but , he manages to still keep playing , 
they wa , 
the coaches watch him all year long . 
they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not , you know , completely out of control . 
but i guess most every team has someone like that , 
i don't , 
oh , yeah , 
there are some really big guys playing in football . 
absolutely they get bigger and bigger , it seems every year . 
i guess you have you know , to stay in the game i guess . 
you would , uhhuh . 
um , now who , 
would you say that you have a fav , 
i mean other than dallas , would you say that you have , uh , a favorite quarterback . 
i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the attention , you know . 
oh , yeah , 
well , or i would have to say , you know , someone like montana , i guess , who's done so well for so many years . 
i enjoy watching him play . 
his age is about to catch up with him though . 
he's no spring chicken anymore . 
but he's still performing . 
 and like you say warren moon's an excellent , 
warren moon's an excellent . 
but he's very exciting to watch . 
yes he is , 
 i enjoy watching him also . 
what about , uh , marino ? 
uh , i'm , 
obviously he's a very good quarterback , 
a big fan , you know . 
he may , uhhuh . 
i believe that's right at one point in time . 
but he's a very young fellow . 
of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a good supporting cast , you know . 
that's true , 
if not , he gets beat to death like poor old troy aikman has the last couple of years anyway , 
you kno , 
dallas did better last year , 
hopefully they'll do better this year . 
 uh , probably around twelve , uhhuh . 
uh , i don't know , 
i just think , you know marino will get better 
and , uh , his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl ,
that's right . 
miami's had some down years , too . 
but they all do , i guess , 
that's true , 
and with age comes ,
i'm sure arthritis sets in with them ,
oh yes , very much so . 
hip injuries and things like that , yeah . 
that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game . 
and they're so young , 
that's right . 
 but , they're retired , you know , 
i read well not too long ago that the average , uh , professional career only lasts seven years . 
so when you think about it , that's really not a very long time , of course . 
oh yeah , 
but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that . 
but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years , you know . 
a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple . 
that's ri , 
holy smokes , that doesn't seem like very long . 
that's a pretty short career on average . 
of course they play their , you know , cards right and do some good investments , you know , they'll do all right . 
but a lot of them don't , unfortunately . 
um , what do you think of the , uh , l a raiders , 
used to the oakland ? 
 but that just may be , you know , perceived , 
you know perception , 
i don't know . 
al davis strange looking guy . 
apparently he's kind of a wild guy , 
i don't really know for sure . 
they've had some excellent teams , though , obviously . 
they have . 
i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play , 
they keeping talk about , you know , going , 
well , uh , anyways , i'm not exactly sure 
and , uh , i don't know , 
a very steep penalty to , uh , be paid 
and , uh . yeah , 
how do you feel about it ? 
uh , i believe in it , too .
i'm catholic 
and we're not supposed to , 
but , uh , i feel that it , 
like you , 
you know , on the premeditated murders i feel you know , i mean , if it's beyond a doubt that you did it , you know 
but , it's the cases , you know , like sometimes you , you know , you hear of people that they say they went to jail falsely , you know , 
they really didn't do it . 
well , you know , what if a mistake is made and you put someone , you know , to death that really didn't do it . 
there's always that chance , 
i don't know , 
but , i would say that , you know , for that many people to all of them agree that you did it and it was premeditated , it would be kind of hard for , you know , 
you know what i'm saying ? 
if the   evidence wasn't overwhelming , right ? 
so , uh , i , 
well , i think that should be likewise decided by the jury , you know , because , i don't know , i think a jury would be less likely to just send a man to death just for , any reason , 
i don't know a judge might be a little more coldblooded about it . 
uh , i'm not sure about pennsylvania , whether we have it or not . 
for some reason i was thinking that we do , 
but you know , it's not very often . 
i think maybe last year was the first time in like eighteen years or something like that , that 
i don't think we , 
i don't , 
do you know if virginia has it ? 
i know florida has it . 
oh , yeah 
they're always   in florida . 
florida and louisiana , i think , and , uh , some of the ,
course they have such a crime problem because they have such a unemployment rate . 
uh , you know , 
get that unemployment way up 
so then people , you know tend towards crime , 
and then they start stiffening the penalties . 
but it's funny that , uh , 
i mean , like , you know , like i said i think last year was the first time in like eighteen years for pennsylvania . 
i'm not even sure of that , 
but for some reason i think that , you know , it was something like that . 
and , it surprised , 
and even florida , i know they have it , 
and you don't really hear about it real often , how many people , 
well , in florida seems like , uh , two or three times a year . 
it's constantly on the , 
but , you think that , 
i mean if you think of how many premeditated murders are committed ,
that's true . 
course they have a requirement uh , that every single appeal must be permitted . 
so , of course , the attorneys ,
everyone would appeal . 
that's true , too . 
they go all the way up to the supreme court , you know . 
they almost always get thrown right back out again , 
but they have to have every single appeal made open to them . 
some of these guys are really , uh , you know , violent son of sam killers and stuff like that , you know . 
i mean , they , 
 and then they get out . 
everyone knows they're not going to get out . 
they get out in three years on probation , 
 and they do it again , you know . 
it's like a slap on the fingers for them . 
i don't , 
i think that it should be , 
i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate you know , someone should take their life also . 
would you draw the line there with just the premeditated murder ? 
uh , a lot of the other violent crimes i don't really feel that strongly about . 
although , you know , stiffer sentences and lessening the effects of parole , 
 i mean , these guys are certainly not going to , uh , be , 
they can't , 
i mean they're getting into drugs and fights and all that stuff in prison . 
i don't think the parole system is really helping that much .
reduce the violence in the prisons . 
i think that's its only purpose 
but some of these guys just don't care ,
 and so , uh , 
i think some of them would rather be in jail .
they probably have it better in jail than what they would out in the streets . 
um , that's possible i guess . 
i don't know , uh , 
i was just going to say something , 
i forgot what it was . 
 oh , i don't even remember what it was now . 
um , so where do you live in pennsylvania ? 
in clarion . 
well , i live in butler , 
but i'm at college . 
i'm at clarion university . 
oh , okay . 
i don't think i really know that . 
because , uh , you know , 
that all depends , too , on where you are at . 
that's , uh , sort of interesting to get opinions as to where different parts of the country are . because the more grass root to support capital punishment , where the places that are , you know , less in contact with crime 
see , yeah , 
well , see , i'm in kind , 
okay , uh , 
we only have seven thousand students in the entire campus . 
and that would be pushing it . 
so , i mean this is definitely a college town . 
uh , we're about two hours north of pittsburgh if that would help you out any . uh , 
two hours where ? 
north of pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 
oh , okay . 
near polk ? 
oh , i've never heard of polk 
polk institute . 
it's , uh , an old , uh , university that turned into a place for the mentally retarded . uh , 
oh , i never heard of that . 
very old , uh , historical place there . 
it might have a new name . 
sharon , pennsylvania's up there . 
we're probably about an hour away from sharon . 
oh , okay . 
uh , so , i , 
most of the kids here , i , you know , 
like , you know , just from dorm mates and stuff , they'll say that they don't believe in it , 
but then after i would say my point of view , then they'll say , well , yeah , 
you know , da , you know . 
in that case , maybe , you know . 
you know , i think people can be persuaded one way or another . 
i've never seriously ran into someone , i mean like , other than my priest , you know , who definitely says you know , you can't take anyone's life . 
uh , anyone that is like so against it that you couldn't persuade them in any instance . 
that's true . 
well , it , you know , 
you get certain circumstances where you hear about these people that have , you know , stolen kids and , you know , 
you just 
i mean , that is just 
and , uh , you know , we had a case like that here 
and , on the other hand , you know , people are saying that because the criminals know that the , uh , penalties can be very severe , 
they , uh , 
there's less criminals that are , you know , turning themselves in , or , you know , pleading or whatever , because they know that the judge , you know , if they find them guilty for the death sentence . 
well , i'm just saying the client , lawyers are saying . 
they're saying that , you know , you know , more of my clients would have pleaded guilty if they would have gotten a light sentence instead of possibly having to get a death sentence because you can't plea bargain 
that's something , you know  , 
but , uh , whether they plea bargain or not , if they're guilty of murder , they're guilty of murder , you know . 
so i don't think that they deserve anything less .
it's just , 
i don't know , 
i just  , 
i was just saying that way , 
what they're saying is that they can't get people to turn themselves in then . 
and so , we have to go through a trial then to prove the person's guilty . 
and that costs money , yeah . 
and perhaps we can 
and perhaps we can't 
and so the guy might get off . 
 and , uh , although usually the guys that are turning themselves in are guys that are , you know going to get caught anyways 
there's always a few of those people that you know , lost their head or whatever . 
anyways , but , uh . yeah , 
we just had a terrible case in virginia where some girl disappeared 
and the guy , like i said , he just , uh , said that he took her , 
but he won't admit that she died or whatever , 
and he won't say where the body is because he knows the penalty's you know , mandatory life sentences for murder . 
so , how do we fix the national budget ? 
damned if i know . 
um , i don't know , 
i suspect , uh , 
let's see , 
i suspect we should do what everyone says we should do , 
we should cut spending and maybe even raise taxes 
but lord knows one shouldn't say that . 
that would probably be good , 
the true source of the problem is , that we do spend too much , 
 but also , that we don't take in enough . 
well , why do you say that actually ? 
uh , too few americans are working . 
if more americans were working and meaningful good paying labor ,
rather than using taxes . 
oh , that's interesting . 
that's probably true , 
i mean , well , that normally goes to support those people aren't working , it's back in the system . 
so , you're right . 
that's a real neat idea . 
well , what , 
but , i mean , what can , you know , 
i mean , to raise jobs i wonder . 
well , i hesitate to say we ought to spend ourselves to  affluence  
but , in fact , in some cases that's what we ought to do . 
oh , okay . 
so , start   .
not reaganomics , thank you . 
 but , that's not going to work , uh , 
uh , what i was thinking more along the lines of is start going to space . 
and that way just create more jobs or whatever ? 
 , well , that's a neat idea . 
we also need to , uh , assure that there's some work in the private sector . 
that's what , 
you think space would do that much for that 
i think we would fill up new technologies . 
but i think we should also do something rather radical . 
like what ? 
legalize marijuana . 
oh , you think that would , uh , have a major effect ? 
 well , that would  put a lot of criminals out of business for a while anyway . 
on crime anyway . 
yes , uh , 
i think it would take some of that money out of the hands of criminals . 
i think it would reduce the amount of carry on drug use where people advance from one drug to another . 
that's probably true . 
i think most importantly it would give the federal government something new that they could tax . 
 and probably a lot of . 
and really receive some revenues from . 
but  that's potentially   , 
uh , if you look at prohibition historically , it's repeal helped the federal government a lot in tax revenues . 
uhhuh , huh . 
i had never thought about that . 
then i think once we put money back in the coffers of the federal government ,
and this would have to come rather quickly , and would have to come originally also where we're not paying , 
in some cases we do pay more , for welfare recipients to live then they can earn in the true minimum wage environment . 
that's true often times they are paid more , yeah . 
and you can't deny people the right to supply their families better through whatever means . 
that's just sensible on their part . 
that's just what on their part , 
i'm sorry , 
i missed that . 
so , if you lower the amount they make and raise the amount of true minimum wage jobs , not those that are affected by the federal minimum wage , then more people will get off welfare . 
that maybe true . 
that's very true . 
you know , give them a true incentive to want to work . 
and then don't start letting more outsiders in for a few years until we figure out exactly where we're at with unemployment . 
that's a , 
reduce immigration ,
and along the same lines , maybe reduce imports as well , i think . 
oh , absolutely , 
that's right , 
when we're in a world of hurt , well , reduce them through legal means . 
i think we ought to just tax them severely . 
well , that's what happened in other country though . 
and other places they tax us quite ha , 
i mean , they tax american imports quite heavily . 
so , we could do the same thing , 
i mean , just , 
and , you know , they may get , 
it seems only fair . 
it does seem only fair , 
i mean , why not . 
and i think really if we got all those that are ablebodied into the work force the amount going out for those purposes , created new jobs for that work force , there would be plenty of money . 
i think so . 
and then at that point ,
oh  real   , 
force it all into the private sector . 
oh , really i love the switch . 
well , at that point it wouldn't be a problem anymore possibly , you know , 
we would be , 
that's right . 
but i think the , 
uh , space was just a convenient place for me to go because that would put a lot of , 
 millspec  and nasa work operates to the same demanding specifications , 
that would put a bunch of defense workers back to work . 
compared to defense . 
well , that's a good idea . 
well , it , 
well , you know , and find out where it is we're paying ten thousand dollars per toilet seat or something . 
you know what causes that ? 
um , greed , i suspect . 
your buying large    , uh , 
the government specifications , 
sheets of paper for building a pair of b v d underwear for the federal government ,
if it was all on nine by elevens stacked one on top of another . 
for making , you mean , government issue underwear ? 
to just understand those legal requirements and operate within the government guidelines ,
well , that's potentially a fault of the government then , i mean , that things like that should , 
a huge amount of it is not the fault of the contractor . 
well , that's a , 
i had never heard that before . 
uh , a huge amount of what you hear about the seventyfive dollar hammers ,
it comes from senators that don't know anything about it . 
uh , my job is government tooling specialist . 
oh , okay , 
so , you know about some of these things . 
what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have ? 
oh , not very many of those at , uh , 
sometimes i play the trumpet , 
and sometimes i work on trumpet mouthpieces . 
and then i have a five year old daughter 
and we cut out things , uh , and , uh , use markers and things like that . 
um , how about you ? 
well i used to be more into crafts , when i was younger , like high school stuff . 
i was in four h 
and i did a lot of latch hook 
um , and , uh , i've learned how to crochet , 
but i don't really know , 
i mean , i don't do it that much . 
not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad . 
i'd rather be outside . 
um , i used to play trombone .
i don't know if that was a , 
not really , 
i don't play it that much any more , 
but i , um , 
what else do i do . 
mainly do reading . 
i don't have a lot of crafty type things i do . 
but , uh , what are some other things you enjoy ? 
i don't know . 
in the antique business . 
and uh , he goes around to garage sales 
and he buys all kinds of , um , china and figurines and statues and stuff . 
and , um , there's some stuff that's really for , uh , auto repair . 
it's called j b weld 
 and i repaired a gasoline tank with it once . 
but he ,
it's an epoxy resin that you mix together . 
oh , cool . 
and he makes like , 
the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a statue that's real small , 
it's like about maybe 
the hand's about the size of a cricket .
oh , wow . 
and he was repairing that , 
and , uh , it came out pretty good . 
and it looked , you know , just like it had been there all the time . 
and he fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them , and , uh , molds that in . 
he had a he fixed that way . 
it worked out real well , too . 
do you ever , 
course that's like that , uh , hooking that you were talking about . 
that takes a lot of time . 
that's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff . 
and he used to paint , um , a long time ago , 
but i think he's stopped pretty much now . 
but i mean , like he has a computer , 
and i use , um , the graphics 
that sounds interesting . 
um , does he ever , uh , refinish furniture or anything like that ? 
oh , yeah , 
but it's not one of my favorite things , especially from the vapors , 
and we had , uh , an entertainment center we did last year . 
uh , we bought it at an , unfinished , uh , furniture place 
oh , yeah . 
but , it's nice to have it when you're done , 
 i mean , looks pretty . 
sure is . 
so , i've done that once 
but it didn't come out that well . 
did you use a zar stain ? 
uh , i don't remember . 
it was , 
i had my parents buy everything , 
and i ended up , 
it was their kitchen table . 
it came out really dark . 
um , they had a , um , 
well i saw the commercial on t v , 
and they , 
uh , and the people at the unfinished store recommended it , 
that's called , 
it's z ,
and , uh , it spreads real evenly 
and it doesn't dry too fast , 
so it's , 
if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out . 
and uh , we ,
kind of made it sticky for a while . 
but after it dried out , real hard , 
and it was all right . 
i remember it took me a long time , 
it took me like or several weeks to do it during the summer , 
and then after i got it done it was pretty dark , and ended up not being real smooth looking . 
since i've moved away they've had it redone . 
so , i kind of gave that hobby up real quick . 
but , i don't know . 
like i said , i like doing a lot of outdoor stuff , 
i like that .
were you the girl scouts , too 
well , yeah 
when i was real young i was for a couple ,
excuse me . 
so , uh , anyway , it was nice talking to you dudley . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
have a good day now . 
you too . 
what do you read ? 
uh , well , i read everything , uh , i guess , uh , 
what is your favorite ? 
uh , well , i like all kinds , uh , 
in fact i was just reading , uh , a magazine now . an automobile magazine . 
uh , i like historical , uh , books , time magazine , newspaper , how to do it type things , uh , uh . 
 oh , i am not much into magazines . 
i do read them . 
i like good housekeeping and stuff like that . 
i will get 
main thing , i like pierce anthony . 
i love pierce anthony novels . 
oh , the novels , yeah . 
i am not into soaps and all that stuff . 
i am , uh , not into novels at all really , other than historical things . 
uh , uh , i am kind of a chore person . 
i like to do , 
i am a fix it person . 
i would read all those kinds of things . 
 figures  . hat , like those , uh , magazines you get through the mail ? 
i will buy car magazines , 
course i am an engineer 
and i read the engineering magazines ,
and , uh , well , i am reading during the czar's time and what it was like and everything . 
what about like those time books that they put out about , uh , uh , oh , ancient discoveries ? 
you know , th , 
how they found out like that , uh , ancient man , performed , uh , brain surgery successfully ? 
and stuff like 
oh , you 
i have read some of that . 
i did not , 
some of that uh , 
i do not really know that they have the answers in those books . 
they , make conclusions in them that may or 
but they are very interesting .
 oh , i like far out facts or whatever . 
i like to read stuff like that . 
but i am a superficial buff . 
i cannot i just , 
you are what kind of buff ? 
oh , okay . 
i like it if it is fun . 
i do not get too into it . 
oh , yeah . 
well , i am kind of a hobbyist 
so i read all those things that , uh , 
and being an engineer , all those books that would bore everybody else , you know , how to do things . 
i am one of those crazy people that reads the directions . 
it always make my wife mad . 
when she ever there is something , i say , well , have you read the directions ? 
i hate reading the directions ." 
i say , well , engineers , we are the few people in the world 
you are an 
are you an engineer for t i ? 
okay , uh , 
i worked at t i for a little while . 
uh , we have got a book that says , uh , how do they do that ? 
and it answers everything . 
oh , really ? 
and i , 
well , not everything 
but a lot of silly little questions . 
oh , yeah . 
like what makes a firefly light ,
those are , oh , interesting . 
oh , you like science things ? 
uh , i have not gotten them in a long time . 
what is that , uh , one that is on t v ? 
that book , uh , national geographic is really a fascinating book , uh , 
or e , 
well , that , do not , 
but i have not gotten them in years , uh , 
they were kind of expensive . 
i know people just collect them like they are , 
they have wonderful photographs and just amazing photographs that 
we used , 
my little sister was blind and going to school , 
and she would have to come home at night , cut out different , 
she was not fully blind , just legally blind . 
but she would have to cut out different colors , 
and that is the best book to go through , those national 
it is . 
they , uh , 
the photographers just got 
and they are great . 
i love reading about animals . 
the gorillas and stuff . 
and the sloth , it fascinates me . 
that's something moves that slow .
oh , yeah . 
and it is just weird . 
you know , i have not , uh , 
of course , was it all books and things 
or was it any , 
but , uh , 
oh , well , 
uh , i glance at all newspapers . 
i do like , uh , 
since the re , since the economy is doing so bad , i never have read the , uh , uh , financial pages more often than now , you know . and trying to analyze and look for some good news in , in there , you know . uh , 
well , for me 
well , wh , you know , 
but like i said , i do not keep up on all that . 
well , i have only been more interested because of things are doing so bad and everything . 
i thought 
you always look for things with , 
with everything 
oh , yeah , 
it is , uh , 
hopefully , uh , we will recover here , uh , 
i know i heard bush say that , you know , we are either bottoming out or seem to be . 
but that is bush saying that .
and he , 
i know , 
i do not really know if , uh , any one person knows , uh , 
uh , but there are some interesting things in the paper , really . 
well , i like ann landers .
i like getting the paper and reading the want ads 
and just , 
i do skim over it . 
but mainly i am a front page person . 
i do not go into the details . 
i glance at it . 
with the , so much , uh , 
you sound like you have a family too . 
but with a family and everything , there is just so much going on that uh , actually i am more of a r , 
not more of a radio buff 
but , uh , it is easier to do when i do some chores ,
i do , 
every time i come in , uh , i will punch up , 
but they call it t news and all that . 
and i do get , uh , 
it gets a little bit of everything . 
when i wor , 
i know you do , being an engineer . 
there are some times when you have got ten or fifteen or even an hour off .
not in the area i worked in .
we had an engineer in there every ten minutes . 
oh , yeah . 
it is , uh , interesting , uh , with the computer to read the computer news and ,
that is a source of reading . 
i hadn't thought about that in that respect , uh , 
well , it just encouraged me to read it . 
oh , yeah , 
it does have a good , uh , simple , uh , you know , 
again you can read it uh , in a lot less than ten minutes . 
it is usually , 
you can page through it in , 
i do not read everything on , 
some of the stuff is pretty boring . 
i skip over some of that . 
but , uh , 
i do not , 
uh , i read it so less 
and i watch so little t v , i did not even know what the deal was with this , uh , oh , 
i cannot remember his name now . 
him and his wife are getting divorced , 
and he is tycoon or something . 
oh , yeah . uh , 
what is his name ? 
uh , trump . 
donald trump . 
i still do not know what the whole deal was with that . 
well , i guess because he was so rich , you know . 
when you are that rich , uh , you always get into the paper , whatever , if you have a family problem , whatever . 
well , he had a young girlfriend . 
he is well into his forties , 
and i guess he got a young girlfriend who , uh , 
every time you take , 
 so that is all it was ? 
he was just having an affair on his wife ? 
he was , uh , uh , essentially like you said , a tycoon . 
uh , donald trump had it all . 
he was high roller for about ten years , 
and then he is now , uh , essentially bankrupt , you know . 
and so , uh , h , 
that has got to be hard to go from really rich 
right , uh , 
who knows , uh , 
but , uh , he was kind of an arrogant guy , 
so i think the newsmen , uh , enjoyed , uh , writing about him on his way down , you know . 
uh , she was actually somewhat of a business partner of his , uh , did very well . 
ivana trump , uh . 
oh , yeah , 
 well , see that is like i said . i do not watch much t v any more either . 
but i have got three kids .
oh , yeah . 
i can imagine . 
uh , uh , i know what you mean , really . 
well , anyway , i have enjoyed talking to you . 
well , uh , hang in there . 
and good luck with those kids . 
and have a good holiday . 
basically , uh , my husband and myself use the credit cards in regards to major purchases . 
we really don't get into small little purchases . 
if we're going to purchase something quite large we might put it on a credit card , 
but , other than that it's not something that we use a lot of . 
uh , we may have only two or three versus , uh , i know a lot of people have up to a half a dozen or , uh , up to a dozen credit cards , 
but , uh , ours are just major credit cards that we have and , uh ,  , when we feel it's necessary to make a big purchase . 
is that like visa 
do you have department store credit cards too , 
uh , yeah , 
sears is pretty major with us simply because we do , uh , 
and they're real good with their appliance and stuff like that 
but , uh , we try to avoid them with a passion because of the percent of interest rate . 
if you've got the cash to pay for something , it's better to do it that way than versus credit cards , unless it's a small enough sum that you can do it within a two , three month period , 
my husband and i do basically the same thing , 
but we end up sneaking a few in there that surprise us . 
we still pay it off every month 
but , we do it mainly for , you know , the cash flow , 
what is that , oh , float . 
that's the word , float . 
and , i often will keep track of what i've charged and sometimes deduct it from my checkbook 
so you know . 
and sometimes just , 
and keep a list and make sure 
if we go out to a restaurant , oh , just to float it , 
or , i don't know . 
or , if it's a business transaction 
my husband has a , 
so , yeah . 
or anytime like a plane ticket , or , you know  , 
even if we have the , 
i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it , 
oh , sure . 
for the month or whatever . 
we have a new one from a t and t 
and we you know , haven't used that one too much .
be interesting , 
that's nice , because you can use it for a calling card also . 
it's a mastercard , too , 
it's kind of fun , uh , 
 but you get a lot of junk mail about them . 
oh , yeah 
and you always get these preapproved , uh , credit card things coming through , uh , 
your credit is great , 
so let's send you another credit card 
you're such 
that's to entice you to get more credit cards . 
we'll give you five thousand dollars 
and so , you know , we always laugh about that because it's quite a bit .
i mean , you know , you always constantly getting those preapproved stuff , 
do you have , uh , an annual fee on yours 
or do you get yours through a bank 
uh , ours is through a bank , yeah . *[[should they 'yeah' be a seperate slash unit ?
we had it a long time ago through a bank 
and it just a 
i can't see paying an annual fee for it . 
i mean i almost  , 
oh , you're already paying them , uh , if you don't pay it off within that month , interest , anyway , 
so , yeah , 
that's exactly it 
well , it sounds like i'm being paged otherwise . 
all right , 
thanks a lot . 
good talking to you . 
bye now . 
did you want me to go ahead ? 
i'll let you go ahead and start , yeah . 
well , one thing , 
i guess both of us are very much aware of the equality . 
uh , it seems like women are , uh , just starting to really get some kind of equality not only in , uh , jobs but in the home where husbands are starting to help out a lot more than they ever did . 
uh , it's not uncommon to see men doing dishes , making supper , or taking care of the kids 
or som , uh , 
the generation of my parents and my great grandmother uh , they did everything . 
they went to work 
and they took care of the family , 
but my husband is wonderful . 
that's the way my husband is too . 
i mean uh , doesn't bother him at all to do the dishes . 
it doesn't bother him at all to do the laundry verses , uh , men from way back . 
there is that , 
well , if you did that you were henpecked or whatever . 
there are still some that aren't cooperating 
but  , 
those are very few . 
i think those men don't last very long in relationships because i think women know what they want . 
they're not accepting that anymore . 
and it's hard enough to be a woman out there trying to do everything , uh , you know , and then kind of real light pay . 
there's just no way that we can be happy trying to do it all . 
so it's kind of a , uh , neat thing to see as far as equality in the households , 
and i think that's even going to get better . you know , 
i think it's just going to be where men will do as much cleaning as women do and that it won't be your job description instead of your role definition is this . 
it will be , uh , 
hopefully for my daughter who i instill into , it doesn't matter if you want to drive a truck , honey , 
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a nurse , 
it doesn't matter if you want to be , uh , the president , 
or it doesn't matter if you want to be a lawyer or a doctor , 
it doesn't matter . 
it's what you want to be . 
so i have always instilled into her , 
and i think mothers , um , are doing a really good job in raising their daughters to say , hey , you don't have to stay with nursing , 
you don't have to be a secretary , 
you don't have to be , 
well , i feel like , um , to an extent that is really important , 
if they want to , right . 
um , but i also think it is important for them to be with the children . 
i do too . 
you know , there's a certain part of me , 
and there are some things that men are designed to do better than women . 
i don't think it should ever be totally equal . 
you know that's not , uh , 
we're not made like that . 
well , emotionally i think , uh , 
that's right . 
just being out there . 
it seems that men are now starting to get into groups called men's gatherings , 
and they get together 
and they talk about issues of marriage , talk about manhood , talk about what they didn't have with their fathers . 
are expressing more emotions , learning what emotions are . 
it may be in the future that you know , some men may be better parent or mothers than mothers themselves . 
and some of the men are developing , uh , very good too . 
if you want to stay home and take care of the kids , honey , that's fine . 
i will go out and uh , take care of the , uh , money making . 
and it wouldn't matter if it's a woman or a man saying that . 
one of the frustrations that i have with the way things have developed is that , and for some it's not a problem , it's difficult for a family to make a living on one 
on one income , 
it can be done , 
but you make sacrifices . 
you know , and it's , um , 
kind of like what , uh , my husband and myself are doing right now . 
my daughter's three , even though at this current time she's ready to get involved with , 
she's an only child . 
i don't know ,
what type of home do you have in dallas ? 
we have a , uh , four bedroom split brick home in richardson actually . 
and , uh , we bought it back in about nineteen seventythree . 
so , we've seen it go up in value wise real well .
oh , good .
and it's probably typical of your neighborhood . 
it's , uh , 
i'm in plano just , you know , north of where you live . 
and , uh , we live near coit and legacy in a relatively new development that just has gone in about two years ago . 
so , my home is typical . 
it's a brick home . 
a two story brick home , 
and it's typical of the other homes in our neighborhood too . 
you're in the styles that they have started building in the last couple years with the real high ceilings , 
and , uhhuh . 
those are lovely . 
the one thing we did do instead of having a twenty foot living room ceiling , 
we're from the north 
and we just couldn't stand the wasted space , 
so we had them , 
we have a high entry hall 
and then we had them level off our living room and dining room ceiling to , um , nine feet so we could get bedrooms above . 
oh , nice . 
so , that way we sort of have the entryway that looks typical of the area 
but we don't have so much wasted space . 
and we could get more bedrooms per square foot that way . 
have you , um , found in talking to your neighbors that your utilities are quite a bit higher with those high ceilings ? 
are they ? 
well , i would expect so . 
i know . 
our air conditioner , during the summer we , 
it's over three fifty a month . 
just to aircondition it , 
well , how many bedrooms do you have in your home ? 
i have , uh , a master bedroom and a den on the main floor , 
and then upstairs i have three bedrooms 
and i have , 
i'm a writer 
and i work in my home 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , it's not really a bedroom . 
it doesn't have a closet 
and it , 
so , that's where i work . 
that's a pretty good size room . 
that's neat . 
so we , 
this is our dream home , 
and we just absolutely ,
well , it sounds like a real nice one . 
we're really proud of it . 
i just hope we never have to move again . 
this is al ,  , 
where did you move from ? 
uh , detroit this last time . 
oh , uhhuh . 
we were there two years 
do you like the dallas area ? 
oh , we love it . 
and i would imagine that you have found that the homes  down here  are , uh , a much better value down here ,
oh , really ? 
now that's interesting . 
the quality of the workmanship , we noticed a tremendous difference . 
and they just didn't care . 
if the trim work didn't line up that's just what you get .
that's interesting because i've heard so many people down here say that they don't feel like the quality of the homes , you know , are that good down here . 
uh , so that's interesting . 
well , the carpenter and painter and , you know , everybody the marble man were just there in the house everyday when we would come to check on it as it was being built , 
and they'd say just look at this , 
and you know , 
well , that's good . 
and it really made a difference to us . 
well , i know as i said our house is about seventeen years old 
and , uh , we've been very pleased with it . 
we've had no major problems with it . 
knock on wood .
and , uh , you know , it is uh , with the , you know , two children growing up and now three grandsons roaming through it ,
and we like our neighborhood . 
and the majority of the people , you know , keep up the neighborhood . 
that's important too . 
and that's very important 
risen in value . 
but we bought back when housing was so low , 
you know , and now i , you know , i , 
then it started jumping by leaps and bounds . 
it seems to have leveled off and actually dropped back down a little bit , 
but we're still fine . 
ours is pretty much level in the two years  ,
we're hoping it takes off again , 
it should bring up your property values a little bit . 
that's what we're hoping because ,
your pricing . 
i think once the economic situation in the dallas area 
i hope so too . 
you know . right now there's a lot on the market for sale because of people having lost their jobs ,
so you know , that keeps prices down 
and i'm sure the  packs   , uh , or 
  would like for it to go up . 
i'm sure .
for that reason it can stay the same , 
that's right .
well , basically i am a mother of a three year old , 
so i kind of relate to trying to find a good day care because it's , uh , extremely hard thing to do to trust somebody else with your child , uh , trust their emotional and their safety and 
and , uh , i've been pretty selective , 
and what i'm finding is with , um , day cares that are like day care centers like , for instance , uh , learning tree or kinder care and all of that . 
and when i bring my daughter into such a system like that , uh , they only have one thing going on 
and that's nap time . 
everybody is napping ,
and with that kind of a system my daughter just isn't likely to enjoy it if she has to good there immediately and lay down ,
so , um , home day care has been an option . 
and i've looked into that . 
the only thing is you raise the question of if it's safe , uh , can you trust the people , you know . 
that's right . 
and you never know . 
i have , um , an exsisterinlaw that ,
oh , sure . 
that's really scary . 
i mean , i think center day cares there's so many people coming in and out 
it depends on the age of the child . 
now some children do real well that are at the age of four or five or children that have been in that kind of system for a while 
if it's , 
the kids have ,
and they're sick all the time 
and the , 
i don't , 
do you have an opinion on that , on the u s r ? 
well , the , 
i think the history of russia . 
and they're uh , changing a great deal 
and even in that situation , uh , and you know different authors , uh , there has always been a paranoia .
they've always suspected everybody 
and that's why they put a lot of people to death . 
that happens . 
but stalin 
i guess in particular my viewpoint is that they financially cannot go into a war . 
uh , they are desperate at this point in time to keep their country together , 
but i could not foresee them severing what they have with the u s . um , because they need us at this current time because of their financial situation . 
um , from what i've been hearing is the u s , uh , s r has been , uh , almost bankrupt for years 
 and it's people are desperate , 
and there might be a revolution within the people . 
but i don't think the u s would get involved with it because , uh , there's too close of ties to where i think they understand that gorbachev is trying to make a change , and that we cannot run them like we run the u s 
so , i guess i really have no fear at all of the u s s r verses , uh , 
you get these small little , uh , places like iraq and all of that , that might be something that i'd be more concerned about with nuclear weapons verses , uh , uh , or as big country of u s s r . 
you know , it would totally destroy their whole country because our technology is far advanced from what theirs is at this current time . 
so , i mean sure 
they have weapons to kill us over and over and over , 
but to them that would be a suicide 
and they , 
and the russian people are not suicidal type of people . 
but if you get the iraqis and iran which will do it for the country for the pleasure of , you know , doing whatever , uh , for their country , they'll do it . uh , 
i think you're right . 
there's a little more craziness down there .
uh , the russian people i think are not that much different 
you know i think 
i have a daughter that's frustrated . 
she's on a stool that she can get up on 
 but i , 
if she can't get down on it it's like , get me down right now .
but anyway it was really good talking to you , 
and you have a good weekend . 
you too . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
bye now . 
as far as , uh , universal health care 
i think it's time that we start looking at , uh , getting into that . 
um , health cost has continued to rise 
and i think , uh , there's people that to me it's the fundamental , uh , 
uh , it doesn't matter if you have money or all the money in the world , um , 
you would , 
you should still be  , 
everybody should be able to have surgeries that will save their lives or things that will make their life more comfortable verses than just the rich people that can afford to pay or to work for corporations that have wonderful health benefits . 
um , i think if , uh , they looked at it as a way of business helping out financially for universal health care and , uh , individuals , um , helping out in some sort of way whether it be taxes or some how . 
but , uh , the expenses right now for health care , um , are just unreal . 
well , they really are even when you're not talking about surgery . 
if you're just talking about basic care , 
and , you know 
oh , sure . 
and it just can devastate 
and your constantly , 
the only , 
um , uh , i know a little bit about the , uh , european , uh , universal health care 
and there's some pros and cons . 
one of the things , of course , is everybody gets health care , 
but , uh , sometimes health care , uh , when you get into a universal system lacks in , uh , what would be considered , uh , 
how can i say it ? 
um , over like in poland , uh , where my fatherinlaw lived for years there their health care system is , um , 
because no financial gains are available for doctors . 
uh , they may just go into being a doctor just clearly just to be a doctor for the full reason , 
but most people that go in to being a physician here in the u s do it for financial gain . 
i can do this , 
and i can , you know , 
can still make big bucks .
or plastic surgery 
or , uh , if i become a , uh , heart specialist i'm going to make this kind of money , uh , 
and there's , you know , financial gains toward that . 
and in a universal system i don't think there is a financial gain for the doctors . 
do you think that the quality , um 
the quality 
um , the only way they could do that is by having a real good quality check , um , and also offering some kind of , 
because i think , uh , well , anybody , um , likes the ability to kind of , uh , get themselves financially , uh , situated . 
uh , i guess that's the whole u s concept 
more motivation .
and i don't know if you can have that with a universal system . 
maybe , you know , there's a way of working that out , 
but i know that in poland in particular the doctors just go to do their job and that's it . 
that's what they look at it as . 
there's no , uh , 
and that's sad because if that's the case , if doctors aren't going in to be doctors to help people then maybe they shouldn't be in that area anyway . 
that's true . 
i , uh , 
but i think we have to head toward that way . 
well , we're going to have to do something because there's just too many people in the country that are uninsured 
 and you know you cannot , 
i mean it's just , 
i'm worried when i get older . 
oh , sure . 
 you know , and , uh , let's say for instance you , uh , get maybe laid off from your job . 
you no longer have insurance . 
i mean and you're sixty some or 
oh , yeah . 
i mean you're uninsurable .
that's right . 
and i know people that are paying two hundred , three hundred dollars a month for insurance . 
and how they can do it i have no idea . 
um , i know working for small corporations 
and health insurance , um , myself , um , it would cost for a family 
and this was back three , four years ago to put my entire family up 
and this was working for like a med center , uh , health plan . 
um , it was like eighty dollars out of my paycheck . 
well , ours is three hundred for our family 
and i mean we pay that instead of a car payment .
i mean i'm driving a piece of junk , you know 
well , we do the same . 
i mean it's , 
i think , uh , people are changing their viewpoints of , you know , 
it's getting harder and harder to survive . 
we're going to have , uh , a larger amount of people dying . 
well , uh , what do you all do for camping ? 
well , we don't do so much now , 
but when , uh , i was , uh , a child , we went regular old camping , tents 
and then with our children , uh , we had a pop up tent camper . 
and we used that to go camping . 
where do you go ? 
uh , years ago we lived in oklahoma 
and we went to , uh , i mean 
but , when we did it with our children , we lived in , uh , tennessee 
and we went up to the 
oh , i bet it was . 
around gatlinburg , or 
there's a ridge that goes down from tennessee 
well , now did you all 
and did it get real cold at night , 
but the , uh , camper had , uh , beds in it , you know 
oh , yeah . 
you know , we had our bedding . 
we didn't have to go with sleeping bags . 
but the  , when i was a teenager and growing up , that was sleeping bags 
and , uh , that got kind of rough sometimes .
well , we only did that once . 
now since we've been married , uh , we go real often to colorado to the mountains , 
but we'll 
oh , do you ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
but we're really not . 
but , the one time that i did go camping when i was about , i guess sixteen or seventeen with my family , 
oh , uhhuh . 
and at night it was so cold , you thought you'd never feel your ,
and the smell , 
and the stars were just five feet above you . 
you know , they were just right there . 
oh , just beautiful . 
and it was the most bonding , most wonderful time . 
we enjoyed it . 
but about the fourth day , i thought , if i don't get a hot tub and 
i understand that .
so , when we can go to a cabin as long as we've got running water 
but , yeah 
my husband and i , he says his idea now of roughing it is the regency hyatt . 
  i know that  .
and i agree with him . 
i agree with him , too . 
our children are grown , 
but i know that we liked it when our kids were teenagers because we got away from the t v 
well , that's true . 
and we got just strictly by ourselves . 
we , uh , 
some of the time we would not allow them to take friends along so that it was just the four of us . 
you know , and we could , you know , get back in touch with 
well , that's , 
and they can't believe that they could survive it . 
and then once they're there 
oh , i know . 
i know . 
oh , you know , they just thoroughly enjoy it . 
and we would hike all day . 
mom did the whole , uh , pork and beans and , you know , the slice the potatoes and fry them outside and 
you know , couldn't believe , 
like you know , we'd have these big breakfasts cooked over this little coleman 
oh , yeah , 
with bacon . 
oh , yeah . 
and it would just absolutely taste wonderful . 
and daddy would always try to prove he could catch fish for breakfast 
 so we usually had a bite apiece .
but , i know that you know , as a teenager growing up and going to lake murray , there would be oh , maybe twenty , twentyfive of us because it would be all of my mother's 
oh , my goodness . 
and it , 
well , now , is that hot camping . 
is that where you're hot , like on a beach , 
i mean , is that , 
oh , no . 
because a lot of our friends will , 
we were in the woods , you know . 
well , a lot of our friends will go to east texas in the summer and camp 
and i'm thinking , how could you stand it , you know 
well , we didn't notice it back then , 
but that was back before 
that's true . 
we didn't , 
and , uh , you know , it always rained on us . 
i don't care what weekend ,
but , i like that , 
and see , especially in the tent 
 and you would get your book and just kind of cuddle up . 
cuddle up , uhhuh . 
and i thought that was fun . 
well , i don't know , 
i remember one time , uh , some cousins were in a tent 
and , it was married cousins , 
and they had the tent 
and this , you know , frog strangler that we used to call them ,
and  , they had put their tent over kind of , 
i don't know what , 
it wasn't a creek bed , 
it was kind of like a little , little , uh , gully 
and the water rushed down 
and they said they looked down and there went 
 oh , no . 
and , you know  ,
oh , no .
we just used to have balls . 
you know , it was more fun . 
you know , and , as i said , it just rained every time . 
and then my folks had a cabin at one time at lake tenkiller 
and we went up there , 
but it was never quite the same thing .
well , yeah , 
i understand that , too , because some of the places we , 
in fact , the more urban we get with the television and the cabin and the whole bit , it loses it's flavor . 
it does . 
it really does . uh , 
well , i've gotten in the mood to go now .
even i would kind of like to go . 
and i know if i go home and say , oh , let's go camping , my 
you're crazy .
well , listen , i enjoyed talking with you . 
i enjoyed talking to you , too . 
have a good day . 
thank you . 
any vacations recently that you would highly recommend ? 
 well . that is like my favorite hobby .
oh , really ? 
so , yeah , 
and i have been all over europe and a lot of the united states 
oh , wow . 
uh , what , has been your favorite trip do you think ? 
well , i am not sure . 
uh , i guess hawaii is one of my favorite places . 
better than europe ? 
you know , i have been several times 
so after the first time it is like anywhere . 
you know , it loses that newness , 
i love it . 
i love to go over to europe . 
i do 
and mostly i travel through germany and switzerland 
and we have good friends in england 
and i just love it all . 
i love to look at the different people and the different cultures and 
so how about you ? 
well , uh , i have been to canada several times 
but , uh , that is about it for me . 
i am from denver 
 and so , uh , growing up , uh , we would spend most of our vacations right there in colorado . 
uh , my family is , uh , uh , real into camping and four wheeling , 
and so , uh , several , 
i , think , maybe , uh , four summers in a row , uh , we spent , uh , our vacation time in the summer , uh , four wheeling through , uh , portions of , uh , the southern half of colorado 
and , uh , every time , uh , my mother had , uh , uh , 
i have two other sisters 
and my mother had us , uh , do some studying of the , area which we going to visit 
and then we had to write , uh 
oh no .
we , each got to write little books . 
uh , my fiancee is a very very good photographer . 
that is what she had originally gone to school to do . was photography 
 and , uh , my , graduate degree , 
uh , uh , we have thought very seriously of trying to , uh , incorporate travel into and writing a book about , uh , some portion of travel , uh , 
so we are hoping uh , over to europe and take , uh , a trip from the northern portion of france 
it is kind of a backward s shape , uh , trail that the pilgrims use to take , uh , uh , back in the medieval times , uh , to see the relics , uh , in , uh , southern spain 
and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and romanesque monasteries and , uh , just take that journey all the way down 
that would be quite a project . 
it would be 
 uh , it is our big dream . 
well , it would be a lot fun . 
you know , there is good and there is bad 
and my experience in italy was not my favorite for sure . 
oh , su , uh , 
my daughter is , uh , a twirling champion 
 and she had to perform over there in turin 
and so we had to fly into milan 
and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians , even if they speak english , they do not want to let you know 
oh , sure . 
 and they gave us all the wrong directions 
 and there were just two of us . 
at the airport they put us on the wrong bus .
finally , we saw a policeman . 
he put us on the subway . 
we sat there , uh , 
we did not know italian . 
we looked at each other . 
we said things like spaghetti .
we finally followed some kids who told us where to get off . 
we followed these kids with , uh , gym bags 
and we figured that must be the sports arena 
 and we lucked out 
and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground . 
i mean it was so , 
but , that was our experience 
and i guess all of italy is not like that . 
but where we were , it certainly was 
and the hotel that we stayed in , 
we stayed with our english friends , their team in the hotel 
and it was beautiful . 
it was very modern . 
but it was very far away on a bus . 
so , you know , uh , it was interesting . 
you always learn something . 
and you always have a fun experience 
so it is great . you know . 
you said that you have been to england several times ? 
i wonder , have you ever been to uh , a small town , uh , 
well it is actually about thirty minutes from salisbury . 
it is called , uh , bemerton ? 
our friends live like an hour outside of england , like ash , around there . 
oh , okay . 
 so , uhhuh . 
uh , uh , the reason i am curious , i , uh , 
the other place i would like to visit , uh , 
how do you dress for work ? 
well , uh , uh about the same i dress for school . 
uh , i am a graduate student 
so , i don't have to worry too much about , uh , what i wear too much of the time .
you bet . 
i am a speech pathology major 
and so i do a lot of clinical work 
and when i do clinic work then i have to , uh , uh , look my best . 
look professional .
i understand . 
i am a , 
i own my company . 
i am in the , uh , manufactures rep sales organization 
and my office is a small office 
and i am very casual and wear slacks and sports shirt and things like that 
 but then when i travel it is a little different situation . 
i think in today's society , uh , there is more credibility to be quite honest 
i will always remember , 
i will tell this real quick story when i graduated from college , 
my first job years ago , uh , thirty years ago , twentynine years ago , in fact , was selling agricultural fertilizer . 
i worked for the , uh , smith douglas division of borden chemical 
and i sold uh , you know , manure . 
and , uh , i would go out and call on farmers 
and i would always try to look my best wearing sport coats and things like that , 
but i was calling on guys that wore bib overalls . 
and so , one day i got up and thought well i will just go casual and you know that i called on a guy wearing exactly that , bib overalls , 
and he sort of told me that he expected me to be professional 
 and he sort of expected me to dress as a professional 
oh , really ? 
 so , uh , it was sort of , 
even the farmers . 
oh , wow . 
so i uh , been aware of my dress ever since then and 
but here again i dress casual quite a bit 
it gives you confidence . 
in my business if i call on the the j c penney company here in dallas or say someone say sears and roebuck in chicago , then i wear coat and tie . 
if i call on just , uh , a normal little dealer of mine , i might be casual . 
i call on oshman's sporting goods , again , it may be casual or it may be coat and tie . 
 so it depends . 
it depends . 
uh , so you don't , uh , 
if you had the choice would you wear a tie or not ? 
uh , probably no . 
but then it depends on who you are calling on . 
who you're , 
you like your minister standing up in front of you with no tie , uh , he would be missing something . 
although , he shouldn't be evaluated on that . 
so , its' just different . 
that , uh , 
if you wanted to , uh , uh , really get into a hot issue , uh 
 , well at least in some in some beliefs , uh , how people dress when they go to church pretty hot topic . 
it is . 
i am , uh , like a catholic 
and the people that go to my church , you know 
catholics dress very casual 
people in jeans and in whatever , 
but yet the way i was raised , 
i am a converted catholic , 
the way i was raised , 
i was raised a baptist 
and like as a youngster i use to always dress up all the time . 
i guess that has changed also . 
uh , yeah . 
uh , i go to the church of christ . 
i have been raised in the church of christ 
you're supposed to look your sunday best 
 uh , when i see in other economic areas like in kentucky . 
you know , people just don't have that 
and they are afraid to go to church or afraid to go simply because 
 but   .
that is a very good point . 
i am from west virginia 
so i understand what you are saying there 
and , uh , evaluation of an individual . course , all of it depends on the type of job responsibility you have . 
i think you have to dress sort of accordingly . 
but , uh , you certainly should not judge a book by its cover and , uh , or evaluate a person by that . 
what about season to season . 
i guess your dress changes . 
uh , yeah 
uh , uh  , of course in the summer if i can get away with it , i wear , uh , uh , a pair of shorts 
and that's it . 
run around barefoot ,
but , uh , 
welcome to the net 
and , uh , what did you do about your last auto repair , 
well , larry , my last one , unfortunately , was an expensive one because i had a brand new lincoln town car 
the lights weren't working properly , 
it wasn't their fault , 
but they didn't run it . 
we both had green , 
and she hit me and did about eleven thousand dollars worth of damage to my car , 
my goodness gracious that's , 
that was a huge repair bill . 
i hated that . 
it's a very expensive automobile . 
so it wasn't enough to total it , 
but that's been my most , uh , expensive repair probably in the last year , with the except of just service work , because i buy a new car every two years 
oh , and do you buy one every two years ? 
so i don't know , 
and i leased it on a twentyfour month program . 
first time i've ever done that . 
but i'll probably go back to buying them , because i don't care to lease them .
did this car have one of these expanding balloons , 
or just are there normal safety belts in it , that you had . 
did that help you ? 
uh , it , 
they didn't go off . 
they didn't go off . 
that sort of upset me , 
we weren't going fast enough acco , 
when i called the dealership about it and called ford motor about it , 
didn't go off , uh , 
we were 
it was a bad , rainy , dark , dreary day , 
and the street lights . 
that may be the problem . 
leaning towards the forward 
took off my whole front fender and hood and everything . 
i tell you , just 
my goodness . 
it was uh , uh , 
my doors were okay front and back 
 but it did , uh , right eleven thousand dollars in damage . 
it was a expen , 
then i get it back and two weeks after that , i'm driving it in front of the local high school , and some young man just wasn't paying any attention and runs in the back of me . 
that's another twelve hundred dollars worth of damage .
my goodness . 
so , i'm going to get , 
when my twentyfour months is up on this car , i'm getting rid of this car . 
i would think so .
this doesn't sound like you've got very good luck with that one . 
how about you , larry ? 
well , i'm relatively fortunate about that . 
uh , here we , somehow , don't have many people run into us , although at the beginning of each school season , uh , students move into town who are from big cities , 
and they sort of drive kind of wild for about two , three weeks , then they finally settle down and ,
i understand . 
and , now that takes the strain off of everyone that , uh , is driving a vehicle , 
and i find that the most of the repairs i have to do here is body damage due to the salt that we have to put on the road to , uh , take care of us in the winter time . 
i understand . 
uh , i have a sixtynine cougar and a seventyseven pontiac , so forth , 
and i have to , 
and i drive a honda most of the time , 
and i have to make sure that , uh , salt and so forth are kept off of it , 
and once in a while we have to replace some of the plates in the bottom of it 
i understand that because i'm from west virginia , 
and we had the same thing up there continuously salting the roads for snow . 
well , uh , the body of it , totally rebuilt , uh , to get some of the rusts that were in the fenders 
and then winter got here 
and so i put the cover over it then to keep the ice and snow off , 
but , anyhow , uh , now , are you going to buy this next car 
or you going lease it again ? 
i don't like the rental , 
i think , i'm getting ready to retire myself , 
are you ? 
so , i usually drive a car for three years , 
and so i'd leased this one for two years . 
so i'll probably go back and buy one , 
and , uh , this next car will probably be my retirement car . 
well , that's an awfully big one , uh , that one that you had , that lincoln , uh , 
isn't it too large for normal town driving , finding parking places 
my wife and daughter , 
we have , uh , two toyotas in the family , one nissan , 
and then we have the lincoln 
and the 
well , that certainly would be a wonderful , comfortable machine to take on long trips 
it is . 
i'm very much aware of that . 
i'm like a traveling salesman , 
don't travel a lot any more , 
but , uh , when i do take it , it is very comfortable to drive . 
i'm sure it is , because that's the way that i enjoy this pontiac that i have . 
it only has thirtyeight thousand miles on it , 
but it's 
is that right ? 
well , my wife's toyota is soon to be four years old , 
it thirty thousand miles on it , 
so , gosh , been in such good shape , that'll probably be an eight or ten year car . 
do you feel that , uh , 
my personal perception of government and , uh , the way things are at this current time , is that nobody can really be trusted . 
and i don't feel that too many of the candidates are out there to , uh , be selfserving to the community . 
i think that they have their own , uh , wishes to , uh , be in the limelight and to kind of say , hey , you know , i'm a public official , i don't have to do , uh , certain things 
and they just stand out more . involving themselves more and more with politics 
but it's really , 
after all the things that i've seen in the last ten years about government and now the overdrafts , uh , of checks , uh , before that it was the wonderful , uh , escapade that they had with , uh , the new , uh , oh  god   , chief of , uh , 
well supreme court , 
i'm trying to think of his name and , uh , what they put , uh , him through in regards to , 
 thomas ? 
the sexual harassment , that kind of thing and just to see our government react to that and then just little things that have added up where people have taken vacations on taxpayers' monies and things like that . 
i just think it's very corrupt and extremely poor ,
but it's always the rich person that gets into government . that has the money to advertise , the money to do this . 
there's no more abraham lincolns out there , uh , that can get into government , even if they were poor . 
so , i know that's my personal viewpoint of things . 
doesn't wisconsin have a , uh , state , uh , medicare program or health program ? 
and it was passed 
and that is going to be a heavier tax burden on a lot of the taxpayers and a little bit more on to the medical . 
uh , i don't know if that was done out of just let's be the first state to do it or if it was done really for the needs of the people . 
you know what i'm saying ? 
right now every little state around here is thinking about oh we need to reform the health , uh , system 
and , of course , they think , uh , or minnesota , our neighbor , passed a state law , the health bill 
and it's kind of like we're the first to do it . 
so , i don't know if it's done because we want to be standing out as being innovative in the health system or whether it was done for , uh , you know , a real good purpose to help people that can't afford , uh , health insurance , that kind of thing . 
 well , one of the biggest problems that , uh , we see in government today is a reflection of society in and of itself . 
 oh , sure . 
 and that is , uh , uh , we become so debt ridden and credit oriented 
oh , sure . 
 and therefore , uh , that puts a lot of undue pressure on municipalities , state and federal governments . 
it sure does . 
like you said i think society as a whole , uh , you can't expect , uh , 
when we have t v s and we have things that are kind of bombarded at us for , uh , you know , immorality and this and this and this , that we can expect somebody to come off that's going to be totally clean .
uh , but down the line it does hurt . 
i mean when somebody's corrupt and somebody's doing something , each individual of the society when you find out that somebody's done something or the overdraft policy or , you know , the other things that have occurred , 
 so , uh , 
well , what is , 
see the thing is when a lot of things become acceptable practice 
 and then 
well , that's exactly what happens in government all the time . 
they blow the whistle on each other . 
oh , i hear that you're doing this , 
i've done it 
 and it's not going to get out . 
exactly . it's , uh , 
there's no 
we just had , 
the mayor of dallas is , uh , steve bartlett . 
he also , uh , was a congressman .
and he had been in that position for years . 
and , uh , he was elected mayor of dallas 
however , if the vote was taken today , the whole thing might change because he was part of that , uh , check kiting scam .
oh , sure . 
i don't think , uh  , 
oh , go ahead 
i am glad to talk to an expert . 
i always wanted to know who an expert was . 
oh , well , i'm not an expert , 
i've seen a little pollution in my time . 
it's , uh , 
the chemicals we were dealing with were , uh , a raid repellent 
and , uh , that was really quite dangerous , 
i'm not certain that that was , 
that's really a pollution issue . 
i think pollution issue over people catching , uh , things like , uh , respiratory disease . 
uh , well , there's two things , uh , 
the one i'm interested the most , i guess , myself , uh , would be the freons  i mean   , for  air cond ,  
the one , i guess , that's the one i'm most curious about is how they're going to replace the freons in airconditioning . 
that seemed to be the biggest surprise to me 
and whether , 
when they replace it , you know , they're going to really come up with something that is not just as bad . 
well , the , you know , 
that's another arguable issue 
and i've seen the , uh , uh , uh , 
assuming you can buy into global warming i bi , 
i , uh , was , uh , you know , 
where they were all concerned about that , 
but that it seems to be , 
well , did you see carl sagan on sixty minutes in kuwait and they'd set those , uh , all th , 
uh , it was interesting 
but , uh , i'm just curious what he has to say now that they've got them all lit . 
was that before , 
i didn't see it , 
was that before they actually did that 
or it was w , 
and his argument uh , a year with no summer .
because of that , 
and it ac , 
it actually happened , 
uh , it was a volcano erupted 
and it was high enough up 
but , uh , they had some people from the national meteorological center i think it was   which is the national , anyway , research people 
and they said uh , that the pollution would not go high enough . 
and it's going to be interesting to see if carl sagan and his billions and billions of stars , 
but among the , uh , meteorologists at , uh , 
i'm , uh , member of the american meteorological society , 
and an , 
are you d , 
you didn't work at t i ? 
oh , okay . 
but i did that in my   .
where do you work in research , 
oh , okay . 
but i'm in the active reserves as a weatherman , 
oh , okay , 
 uh , i keep up from time to time , 
but what uh , that , uh , maybe there isn't global warming and maybe there is . 
but , um , if there is , uh , we probably could do something about it now , 
and if there isn't and we do some the right things , i think , 
how do you feel stuff on cars . 
uh , well , i'm kind of a car buff myself , 
i was going to ask you another question , 
but , uh , i'll do that in a minute . 
not using  . . . 
 well , do you have an older car ? 
i have been working on an older car 
but it to , 
oh , i'm a car buff too , 
well , i'm restoring one . 
i think uh , ninetytwo octane i don't think you'll have any trouble . 
i'm not having any problem it's a seventy . 
oh , yeah . 
and the . 
i think , uh , 
i , uh , work on my own cars 
and , uh , i don't think that's a problem . 
i thought , 
i'm saying , i was glad to get rid of leaded gasoline , 
but did you have another ques , 
you said you had another quest , 
uh , oh , ye , 
i was watching c n n 
and i cannot remember what station it was , 
did you see the advertisements , uh , where they talked about nuclear war , what that would have been like in changing the atmosphere , 
it is so scary that i hope that every one of the government officials saw that because it was just total disaster , you know . 
uh , e , 
did you see any of those , uh , i , 
it was , 
i know that the , uh , 
that's  . . . 
it must have been channel thirteen , 
i don't recall , 
although , i thought it was on c n n , oh , 
well , that , 
they  called nuclear winner  
that's the ultimate , uh , pollution problem . 
it was a somewhat of a commercial because it i saw it regularly 
and it showed that 
and it was really devastating 
and ,  it would , uh   , 
 well it , 
how much ash would fall 
and how it would essentially literally destroy the world , you know . 
well ,   the chernobyl accident , uh , 
actually , um , because the circulation budget as high as it went , uh , covered , uh , a fairly remarkable amount 
they did some tracers 
and they 
i think it's  drawn  in , uh , 
i think , gets in there 
  i can't think of the other trace , 
but i saw on that 
and they , 
it went quite a long ways but i guess i can be a little sympathetic 
but , you know , there's some argument that uh , the pine trees giving off pollution 
oh , really , 
there's probably a lot of natural things , uh , 
but the , 
but and see all that haze from west texas ,
uh , it , 
i guess it's got to be really , 
i don't know , 
i don't know if it's air pollution uh , it's dust pollution whether it's natural or not i don't know . 
well , it , 
that's the thing is that i think dallas really does have a problem in this , 
the idea if we could get some cleaner burning fuel , 
the problem is it's like los angeles . 
people don't want to use mass transit , 
oh , yeah , 
well , i live in arlington 
and there are no buses . 
i mean , there is , 
the only buses you see are school buses , 
but who wants to , um , ride a bus ? 
well , i know it's , uh , you know , 
the car is , 
we have this big romance with the car , 
but , uh , i think people would be interested if you had one , i mean . 
well , my boss drives forty miles one way each day . 
and one of the guys that works with me drives fortyfive miles . 
and they don't think it , 
well , i guess they do think something of it 
but , um , not even to , you know , 
you consider how much , um , 
but then you get into all these issues it's the types of pollution and what it's doing to your lungs 
so , we all move out out of downtown 
so we get away from the smog . 
my wife grew up in southern california 
and they moved out to the valley when the valley was clean . 
and now the valley is not 
and so people move out  one more  valley and , 
well , you said you were car buff , uh , 
i think that , uh , all of us could use one electric car right now , i mean , today ,
when you go to trips and all you can have one gasoline car 
but i think we all could , in a family , say , have an electric car where my wife , she could use one now if they had one , you know , 
i think no , it's alcohol vehicles that they're testing   .
you're right . 
  i have seen them 
but , uh , they have a battery car . 
but they suppose , 
 uh , i went to the auto show this past week 
and they did not endorse , 
now that i think of it , 
and i was so interested in the auto show i didn't think to ask anybody , 
there were no electric cars . 
i was surprised 
but now that you just mentioned that . 
 well , the  road and track was talking about that apparently general motors has some , uh , 
they apparently think they're close . 
i think , uh , there could be a lot of  peo , 
i thi ,  
people close this is really , 
we're nine years away or less , i guess , from the next century and i think , 
 well , there's still a lot of research , 
i was over i guess , it's been about a month ago 
and saw this ,   research  it was a little light  that says solar powered research . 
they've got a area over in , the  s m  building too which is , uh , 
but it's a solar , uh , 
it's for , uh ,  the , g , 
  gots  some money from a power company 
and it's probably more generating power for , you know , uh , electricity , a hundred and twenty volt or whatever . 
well , do you work in that c building ? 
but , uh , 
oh ,  i'm at   , 
uh , i'm the  facility  
so i've been in most of the buildings anyway . 
oh , well , i'm in  the  c building , 
been there for , all my life . 
 oh , yeah , 
well , right around from the auditorium now . 
and it , 
they've got several different , uh , areas where they're called solar lab . 
well , that's been a  con ,  
i know the focal plain array is they were taking space a long time . 
but the solar project , you know , t i's been into it for years , 
and i guess it's just not , uh , economical yet because of the other fuels . 
well , the problem is that gas at a dollar a gallon , you know , who wants to , 
i mean , we want to not pollute , 
but , uh , at a dollar a gallon , uh , it's hard to beat ,
i've seen some . 
i think 
 then again i'm surprised now i didn't  think they'd asked anybody when i was in the auto show . 
there was nothing , uh , 
and there was no , place for air pollution or companies or anyone there . 
it was just pure automobiles . 
well , i thought i saw an ad for volkswagen that had an alcohol , 
they had one with spots on it and something . 
but i , 
it was showing they , 
i mean , uh , 
i didn't see , 
an article . 
did you go ? 
i didn't go , 
so . i wh , 
uh , i was , uh , quite impressed with all the cars , you know , 
the engines are so much smaller now and everything 
and they all have brand new engines , even general motors , uh , 
very few 
only the caprice and them and the cadillac had  uh , the old  veights , 
they're all brand new engines , 
uh , of course , they're burning gasoline , of course . 
they've done a lot . 
and , uh , whether , you know , 
that's one way , you know , uh , uh , f , 
on air pollution i don't know if the automobiles are the biggest contributor or not really . 
they've got catalytic converters , 
everyone seem to have gone to that , whether they last , uh , and do a good job 
and now that the inspection systems are analyzing that , uh , 
well , what do you think you know , if you're concerned about that , 
well , ther , 
i mean , if you're knowledgeable on that . 
well , they , uh , 
it's interesting though because my cars are older 
and so i didn't have to , 
if you live in dallas county you have to have it checked 
and it's    , 
i had a friend with a fiero that , uh , they tried and tried and tried and had all kinds of terrible getting that  pinned  
and , so , apparently  . . . 
well , i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting , 
and then we had uh , a bag filled full of cans 
 and they've been recycling at their school . 
well , she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow . 
but they were filled with beer cans .
and i hated to take a big old sack , i mean , i mean , like a lawn bag 
like i , 
we'll just taking them up there and put them in the bins anyway . 
they had tickets at their school that they recycle either newspapers or cans , 
and i think that's all . 
and they're taking the money that they earn to plant trees . 
oh , that's a good idea . 
and they've got their bins that stay there , 
and they've decorated real cute , you know , with a bunch of big old flowers 
so they're getting into it . 
i don't know what they get for the tickets , though . 
what do you get for the tickets , if you bring stuff ? 
oh , that's good . 
it's not bad , yeah . 
um , i know , 
we are kind of getting into recycling now . 
i'm in college , 
and i live in a dorm , 
and we recycle paper . 
and i know that there's a glass plant up here , 
and they recycle glass , 
and , you know , we recycle old aluminum cans and all that kind of stuff . 
so in each of the dorms you have a place for that ? 
that's really good . 
and then when our dorm , 
whenever our bins are all filled up , we take them and turn them in , 
and then we get money for that . 
for the dorm , 
and who decides what you do with it ? 
and what do they do with it ? 
well , we buy things for the dorm , whatever the dorm needs , you know . 
like we have access to a microwave and an oven if we want to cook things , 
and then we buy , like , cooking equipment and stuff . 
or we play games , like board games . 
we buy board games . 
you know , it's just different things , whatever , you know , 
we vote on it , 
and whatever the dorm would want , that's what we buy . 
well , i graduated from college in nineteen seventytwo , 
and we were just , um , not aware that this was a problem , that we ever would need to recycle . 
of course , you just threw it away . 
so , a little different . 
and i wanted to do this thing that you can get through target , to recycle . 
i had my school do it , 
but my principal said since we're doing this thing called operation desert shield , we're sending letters to all these servicemen and making video tapes and all that .
the whole school , you know , 
it was just this big project , 
she didn't want to get into that . 
and i could do it in the center , 
and i just never got around to it . 
but , it's like a club , 
you know about that ? 
a little boy that had died of leukemia , i think , 
and he had started this , um , save the environment club . 
and his mother is carrying this on . 
and you can get the information to set it up , you know 
you don't have to join it as a group or anything , i don't guess . 
oh , that'd be go , 
but you could start your own anyway . 
get a pamphlet , 
is that what this target is , 
what you're , 
do you all have target stores up there ? 
that's a department store . 
kind of like k mart 
i would like , 
let's start up a target . 
um , i don't really know any other recycling that they do . 
so , you're not having it picked up 
we have to take it to a recycling place . 
now in some of the towns around us , they're already picking up the newspapers . 
well , they're doing that here , too , now that i think about it once every so many weeks , 
and you have to pull out all the slicks , 
and you have to wrap them up with string . 
and , i think that's all they're picking up . 
but you know , like in minnesota , they've got their bins where you put plastics and your bottles . 
oh , i didn't know that . 
because my brotherinlaw lives in minnesota , 
and they're are just nice , plastic bins , 
and you fill them up and put them out with your other trash , 
and they pick them up . 
um . i never heard of that .
do you all have can banks ? 
um , not that i know of .
i sus , 
a big old bin , 
and you just feed your cans slowly into the slot , 
and your money comes out , you know , every once in a while , for however much poundage you've got . 
and if you keep feeding it until the light goes off .
oh my gosh . 
but they had one that i was putting my stuff in , 
and i went to take some today , 
and it was gone . 
i don't know . 
but i located another one today on the way to work . 
uh , we have places where we go 
and what we do is we unload our cans . 
it's like a conveyor belt , 
and the belt separates the aluminum ones from the steel ones because it has a magnet on it . 
and then they weigh , uh , your aluminum cans , 
and then you get money for your aluminum cans . 
but they don't give you for the other . 
but now they're going to start giving us money for the other ones , too . 
before , they didn't . 
but i know they're going to start now . 
well they're certain places , you know , where down there you can take your leaded cans . 
but i don't know where they are . 
they publish it in the newspaper if you wanted to get into it . 
i don't know . 
i'm trying 
i'm not that dedicated . 
well , that's all i really know about recycling . 
me , too . 
if they would . 
oh , i know , we're saving our grocery bags now . 
oh really ? 
you can take them to the stores .
um , like kroger's doing it . 
and i think skaggs . 
do you have those up there ? 
and we , 
they're taking our milk cartons and our plastic coke bottles there , too . 
it sounds like it , 
you'd think you would be . 
i've never seen any , you know , places that do . 
i know , um , we reuse our grocery bags now . 
we take them back , you know , and use the ones that we have . 
you can like , 
if you have grocery bags you can take them and use them instead of getting new ones . 
you mean where you sack your own groceries . 
and i don't want to go with those canvas bags right now , i'm sorry . 
i'm not that european .
but you know , they do that like , 
i went to europe , nineteen seventythree . 
and , you know , they go all the time . 
it's like they would go almost every day to the store . 
and they had their little bags 
and they had this little bitty old teeny refrigerators . 
oh , my . 
that's why . 
they couldn't put anything in it hardly . 
well , what are you going to do when you get out of college ? 
i'm a finance major . 
well , that's why i did what i did . 
i went into teaching .
here in texas it's a real mess right now . 
oh , really . 
oh definitely . 
there's no . 
let's see , 
we've had the funding , 
we've run out of money . 
we've frozen the money . 
and they had until the fifteenth of april to come up some formula that would be more equitable to different districts according to finances , because the poor districts were getting less money , so not as good an education . 
and now they're trying to take some money away from the richer districts , like the one that i'm in , in dallas , and make us pay our money to the smaller ones and make it more equitable . 
and if they can't come up with something by the fifteenth , then the state's supposed to decide , the courts . 
what do you think the outcome will be ? 
i think they're maybe going to give us a state income tax . 
do you have one ? 
i'm not looking forward to it , 
but something's got to be done . 
oh yeah , 
we've had one as long as i can remember .
 well , it's going to hit us . 
and i don't know , 
doesn't seem like it work to take it away when we're using it . 
but maybe , 
i know we're not using it so wisely . 
we have too many administrators 
um , i can't think of anything on recycling . 
me , either . 
anything else ? 
what about people from , um , pennsylvania . 
what do they think about texans ? 
oh , i don't .
have you thought about that ? 
   what you think about pennsylvanians . 
probably a lot more civilized , more , um , refined than a lot of the people would be down here . 
oh really .
i would hope so , 
i mean you've been together a little bit longer than we have . 
i don't know , 
i really don't know anyone from texas or anything . 
i've never been there , um . 
well i've never , 
well let's see , 
i think i have too been to pennsylvania . 
we went up there . now that i think about it . on one of our long trips 
oh , well .
what are you saying , holly ? 
 oh , my little girl is in the second grade , told me to tell you that shboom means goodbye in the israeli language . 
   is what you say it is , holly ? in israel . 
 see she's got this little girl from israel in her classroom that she's befriended . 
so she's into this . 
oh , is it like a foreign exchange type student ? 
you know we've had a lot of the jewish people  . . . 
oh , right , 
up in , uh , t i out there ? 
oh , right .
all right . 
the savings and loan scandal . 
i , got to , uh , 
uh , kind of neither . 
well , i'm a democrat 
so i was going to say if you're a republican , boy we would really have a good time . 
i do have some republican leanings , because ,
 well , i , uh , 
to answer that one before we get to our subject , you know , i always get a kick out of republicans who take credit for all the military hardware that was bought for the war and how successful it was , though when it comes to the budget they say well the democrats control all the money 
and they're the ones wasting all the money . 
and , i always wondered how they can play the money either way they want , you know . 
i get a kick out of that . 
you first . 
uh , i think it's a stinking shame that there isn't capital punishment for those assholes that stold our money . 
uh , i don't think it's over . 
i think that , uh , so many other things have taken over , uh , in the media . 
but , i think it was just plain greed , 
and i think it was deregulation really when they said do anything you want banks . 
go ahead loan your money out , you know . 
i agree with you . 
i think it had something to do with deregulation , 
but i believe , uh , more of it was just greed . 
i was talking to someone , 
i can't remember who it was , 
but he was a small businessman , 
and he said that the banks were calling , 
he borrowed some money 
and the banks were calling and just looking for people to give their money away . 
they just got totally carried away with buying property and reselling the same property 
and , uh , yeah , 
there should be thousands of people in jail as far as i'm concerned . 
not just a couple . 
you know , we've watched and watched t v and seen that a lot of these people were doing things , not just playing in the gray and not just reselling property at a profit , but financing the same property three and four times ,
and the list goes on and on .
well i agree a hundred percent . 
oh , yeah . 
it may have started with hud too . 
i noticed that hud was in terrible shape 
and that was property 
and , uh , they lost a lot of money there , 
and then some of these big , these rich people started to , 
even murchison here , who owned the cowboys , had a lot of property down in florida . 
this was several years ago 
and he lost , you know , all of his money before he died . 
not all of it , 
i don't know how much he lost , 
but , uh , they were just buying property and buying all kinds of real estate and thinking that there was a bottomless pit 
and it always would increase , you know , 
it always would , uh , uh , be more than what you paid for it 
and they just never even got conservative with our money at all . 
everyone forgets whose money it was . 
and , everyone forgets that there are several of these people that are wanted by the federal government currently and are overseas where extradition is merely a funny american word . 
as far as being a republican or a democrat , i think no american could stand for criminal action . 
well now the reason that i said that is because i was going to blame all , uh , reaganomics for , you know , 
you spend your way to prosperity 
and when you opened up the bank deregulation without any controls , i thought , well , that was the philosophy , you know . 
just keep spending until taxes are lower , 
and , i thought , that's not going to work , you know , 
and i knew that it wasn't going to work originally . 
and , it hasn't worked now . 
 in theory , a healthy economy has a lot of spending going on . 
no doubt , 
and , if people are making money , people can spend money , 
and it'll generate taxes . 
oh , yeah . 
i agree with that , 
but there's got to be some control 
and apparently there was , you know , 
well , the problem is , 
and the problem with reaganomics is that the people at the top are the ones getting rich . 
and , for what they would cost 
and we weren't producing anything . 
we , as americans weren't producing anything . 
it was all inflation . 
and , i'm sorry we don't get into a real argument over it , 
we agree too closely , 
 i know , uh , .
oh , no , 
no intelligent person can say that we could spend our way rich . 
remember all we're doing is delivering pizzas to each other . 
and not high quality ones at that , you know . 
 well , i do have a lot of confidence in the american people and the economy and everything else . 
i feel bad when i see the inefficiency , even here at t i , you know , 
and i think that the , 
it still , 
a lot of the workers don't understand that , uh , they need to put out the best that they can because it comes right back to them , you know . 
it is a life and death struggle ,
i know , 
and when i , 
of course i'm in facilities , 
and i work with a lot of mechanics 
and i just cannot understand why they're just happy to spend their time here rather than produce , you know , 
so it doesn't matter , you know . 
i'm very tired of it all pays by the hour . 
uh , and i'm nonexempt . 
oh , really ? 
you don't sound like a nonexempt , jim . 
you don't sound like a nonexempt . 
what does a nonexempt sound like ? 
uh , you're too informed . 
they're very , uh , not interested . 
they wouldn't even talk probably about some of the things we're talking about now . 
i guess i'm dealing with too many texas mechanics here . 
i don't know really . 
 uh , that's , 
i'm being a yankee , i guess i'm letting my yankee come out , you know . 
well , i , 
now maybe i'm not the , uh , typical nonexempt that you deal with . 
the badge is silver . 
and , uh , i am degreed , though nonexempt . 
uh , well that's good . 
that's not good 
i mean , that's good that you're degreed , 
uh , uh , your time will come . 
we , uh , 
i know a few people , 
i do not wish my time to come . 
oh , really , 
are you in a tech , 
like do you do technician work or something ? 
oh , no , 
government tool control is my specialty now . 
i did p c protection control work for , uh , 
oh quality , okay . 
right now i'm just trying to tool crib and   chips . 
times are bad . 
oh , yeah . 
well , now , is , uh , really terrible . 
i'm , uh , management level uh , facilities , 
and when the cuts came , three of us got , uh , bounced back , 
and so we're just , uh , 
i'm covering , uh , weekends and nights now . 
i'm one of the manager reps , 
there's three of us to cover in dallas facilities 
and just we're essentially standby and problems , uh , all nights and weekends . 
that's my , 
i only get one weekend off a month right now . 
i call it my recession job . 
 uh , being basically an engineer and liking , uh , doing installation work , well there's not any . 
i mean there literally is no installation work going on . 
they turned all installation up here off . 
they told facilities they could not work . 
i don't care what the jobs are , you will not work . 
you know , our conversation goes , i would really be interested to know how much of t i's problems now are related to ,
i think that , not only t i , but a lot of it , when they talk about , uh , 
there was one point i was going to make . 
i think the last i heard , 
and i , i have to admit i'm not as informed as them , 
but there's something like about eighty six billion that they admit . 
well , i always double that . 
i figure well , if they claim that it's going to cost us eightysix billion , it's got to be twice as much because no one admits their mistakes 
and so if that's true , it may mean that two hundred billion dollar category that went down the tube somewhere . 
uh , it really hurts me ,
it's amazing really . 
it's amazing that , 
oh , yeah . 
i know what you mean . 
uh , one of our senior , 
course your value of homes up there are pretty good . 
i mean , here they're not really that high , 
but are they pretty good up there ? 
oh , really . 
our economy in colorado springs fell completely apart . 
well we're in the metroplex here , you know , 
and , uh , 
i die every time companies like general dynamics , 
they lost several contracts 
and , i don't know if you noticed yesterday , you probably don't pay attention to the bell helicopter , you know , 
they were going to have big , uh , award , 
and secorski got it . which was boeing secorski , which is up in the north somewhere , you know . 
it's northwest . 
and , i don't know how , 
and also , uh , they do some of that in wichita , kansas . 
well , i don't , 
they were advertising here that it was bell , t i . 
t i was getting the , uh , electronics with bell , 
and so , it was a double . 
one that bell is in the metroplex 
and two , that t i was doing the electronics for them . 
and , t i bell and then all of a sudden , secorski got it , yeah . 
secorski boeing . 
secorski , boeing , 
boeing doesn't need the money . 
i almost think there's some politics around here , because the metroplex here , in the dallas , fort worth area , uh , with t i , 
i don't know if t i has lost as much as everybody else , 
but general dynamics and l t v and bell have lost project after project , you know . 
well , you realize  . . . 
now my personal opinion , 
i don't know . 
uh , uh , here lately it seems , 
well up until a few years ago , i guess , there just too many liberals about and permitting too many , oh , 
they just broaden the human rights everybody , and i don't think those guilty of committing capital crimes should be permitted to go spend a few years in jail and be turned lose on parole . 
it's just not right . 
i think i agree with that very much . 
and therefore 
do you , 
do you think a lot of people , when they are listening to a trial , put themselves in a position like that and say , i would never do something like that , 
and it's for them to believe that somebody else could do the things that have been done ? 
so many of us have led sheltered lives 
i've never done it myself 
i never have either . 
i wish i could have . 
i've just never been called up . 
my husband works as a police man , 
so i always assumed that that was why i was never called . 
well now , that's possible . 
but , uh , i was called up as an alternate once , 
but i 
uh , do they have such a thing now as a six man jury ? 
somebody told me the other day that there is ,   what they call a six man jury , 
and i had never heard of such thing , 
and i wondered if it was true . 
uh , i've never heard of it . 
i never had either , 
but i just wondered . uh , 
and that i wasn't sure on either , whether it should be unanimous or not . 
 uh , well , there again , uh , i suppose it should be . 
that would mean they all would have to decide 
is it guilt or innocence . 
but then again , so many times you get one or two holdouts , 
and there , 
that's not too bad in this sense , because you might get someone in their that's a victim of circumstances 
 i mean , that's happened 
bring some of these things out . 
we can't overlook the fact that there are innocent people that do get involved in jury trials . 
un , apparently there are . 
since my husband worked as a policeman , i can't believe there are very many people that come to trial that 
i still have a little bit of a problem with that . 
uh , but , i would suppose there are circumstances , you're in the wrong place at the right time , or know the wrong person at the right time . 
oh , that's it , 
and you just might resemble somebody . 
uh , out here in texas we had a , great miscarriage of justice . 
after nine years , it was finally , uh , taken care of . 
we had , 
a black man was accused simply because he resembled 
and even though he had witnesses that said that , uh , he was at work , 
and he had all sorts of character witnesses and what not , 
they still found him guilty ? 
when people said he was at work ? 
and he could have gotten away at lunch time 
but after nine years , 
well as a matter of fact they made a t v show about it , after nine years , they finally came up with evidence to prove that he was innocent . 
oh , for heaven's sake . 
so there's nine years of that man's life gone . 
now that just was not fair . 
i guess that's where a lot of the problem lies , 
we bend over backwards protecting the guilty people , the one's that are on trial . 
unfortunately , that's what happens . 
well , uh , uh , it's not the best system , 
but it's the best one in the world . 
it's the best one that exists , i guess . 
and unfortunately , we just have to put up with a lot of things , 
and they try to solve them and everything , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
the supreme court , 
well , i'm still rancled about their decision to permit burning of the flag . 
oh , i think a lot of people are . 
i think they've lost sight of some things that are very important to our country . 
well , it , 
the first amendment definitely says freedom of speech 
and , uh , uh , well that just rancles me 
i swear , if i ever saw somebody i'd try to kill them , i would . 
 that bad , huh . 
i wouldn't like it , 
but i don't know if i'd go that far . 
well , i happen to be a flag freak . 
i was in the service 
i was in korea 
 and , uh , well , i saw what the red in the flag represents . 
well , i think pride in our country and our flag is so important . 
it's important in so many facets of our lives . 
and , uh , people don't like what our flag stands for , they're welcome to go some place else . 
see what they , 
there's nobody holding them here . 
see how they'd like it under another flag . 
they'd soon be back , 
i'm sure . 
well , jean , we seem to be of the same opinions here . 
i don't know about the judge making the decision , if that's , 
do you think that's good 
but i think the jury should be able to recommend , 
make a recommendation ? 
do they sometimes make a recommendation ? 
oh , yes , 
that's what i was thinking they sometimes do . 
i don't know if that's a regular procedure or what . 
but i know i'm always hearing that , uh , 
well , the jury came in with a guilty verdict 
and they recommended ,
 and they recommend . 
and then the judge has the final decision 
of course , now , the jury may not be completely aware of all the ramifications of a sentence . 
they may not know that if you give him twenty years he can get out in five . 
well , i think that's where a lot of people think , boy they're getting put away for a long time , 
but actually , their chance , course , when , 
a lot of times when they come up for parole , they're denied . 
it depends on 
but too many times they are permitted to go out on parole 
a lot slip through the protective whatever they have to do . 
and there are bad ones that do slip back out and end up hurting somebody again . 
they just go out and repeat their crimes . 
well there , 
well , they say after three offenses its automatically life in prison , 
but i think they ought to make it two offenses . 
i always thought there was wrong , 
it seems sometimes that like somebody who is stealing a loaf of bread to feed his family got more jail sentence than somebody maybe that killed somebody . 
it seemed like sometimes there's not a good , 
the balance isn't right . 
it doesn't make sense . 
very true . 
well , here again now , there is where race seems to rear its ugly head so frequently . 
race or nationality even . 
 but , uh , like you said , it's not the best system , 
but it's the best one we've got . 
so , let's put up with it , i guess . 
improve it if we can , if we ever get a chance . 
sure enough . 
jean , it's been awful nice talking to you . 
and i hope you have a real good day and week . 
well let's hope neither one of us ever has to run into this subject we were discussing . 
 i hope not . 
take care now . 
you , too . 
where are you from ? 
um , just here in dallas . 
oh , okay 
that's true . 
 so that's why so many people are from this college . 
you first ,  eve  .
oh , okay . 
what type of foods do you cook 
and what would you , uh , cook uh , uh , let's see , if you were giving a dinner party ? 
and the only reason why i may know a little bit about this , is that i'm planning on having a barbecue pretty soon . 
oh , great . 
and to me , that's the type of thing that i like to give in , um , uh , cooking for people . 
and , uh , if he's cooking outside where it's cooler and , uh , you don't have to do all that much work . you know , you just , uh , slap on some food and slap on some barbecue sauce and away you go . 
we have them too , 
and i'm trying to think which is the , best , uh , that i prefer . 
uh , my wife , uh , doesn't like to have all that work on the very day that you're doing it , uh , 
and we haven't catered out very much , uh , 
i always worry about the barbecue in that you have to be , 
the man always gets that chore , 
and you ,
uh , i've made shish kabob , which i like . 
it's fairly easy and fast . 
uh , where , 
i guess i'm thinking of the easy thing to do 
i do cook , 
but not , 
i'm mostly the easy cooker . 
you know , the breakfasts and , 
although i would like to experiment with , uh , the meals my mother made , you know . 
and i haven't gotten around to that yet , uh , 
what kind of meals did she make that you liked ? 
well , she was polish 
and , uh , she would make very economical meals . 
we were very poor . 
different rice and ham and things that , uh , 
she would throw things together 
and , uh , i would like to try that one day . 
and she would make spaghetti with pork chops and special meat balls and everything . 
and my wife ,
sounds interesting , uhhuh . 
that's great . 
but dinner parties are a lot of work , uh , 
but , uh , the outdoor stuff a , 
people can entertain themselves , i think , a great deal more , uh , when you have a barbecue . especially when you have hot dogs and hamburgers and ,
well , that , 
shish kabob is , uh , just because it only takes a few minutes to cook , you know , 
you get it ready , 
you have to do a lot of work beforehand , i agree , and buy special stuff . 
but , uh , so far as getting out there a few minutes , uh . 
but anyway , i'm thinking of the easy way , rather than ,
but , uh , 
well , do a lot of work . 
even if people do bring over things , you still do , uh , all the , uh , 
uh , you know , my mother used to make an armenian rice dish . 
i'm thinking about , uh , special dishes , 
and , uh , yeah , 
it was made out of rice and consume soup , uh , and bacon and onions . 
oh , yeah . 
and then you'd simmer it like all day long . 
oh it would , 
you'd get the odor of it , yeah . 
and it was just wonderful . 
uh , to try and find the recipe for . 
but we used to have that at thanksgiving time .
and there's so much broth and juice in there ,
 oh , great . 
and that was , you know , 
when you were talking about the polish dishes , uh , some goulashes and things like that . 
uh , that's what i thought about , was that armenian rice dish . 
oh , yes , 
we probably ought to try this . 
but it probably will never taste as good as we remembered . 
i guess it gets better and better as we remember it ,
that's true . 
that's true . 
the recipes are really interesting , you know . 
we're probably going to lose them 
and we'll probably forget all about them , you know . 
since we're trying to make everything so sim , 
here i am talk about trying to make everything easy , you know . 
i , uh , 
you talked about thanksgiving , there are interesting meals at different times . 
uh , something , s , 
my wife's from texas , 
so , uh , i remember we were first married 
and we were living in new jersey . 
and , uh , we were going over to my mother's house for christmas , you know , to have a meal . 
and we were on the way over , 
we were just married that very year , 
and she said , oh , i'm looking forward to a nice turkey . 
and because she had turkey a lot , you know . 
and , uh , that was surprising in the east , uh , 
we always had ham , you know . 
and that's one thing als , 
now the hams just kind of , you know , go take it out of a can or , uh , uh , a package , sliced , uh , 
the cans were cooked for hours and hours and 
i'd like to try that too . 
you know what i found was , at sam's , uh , wholesale 
and , uh , what they have is this honey baked ham , 
oh , yeah , 
i saw them . 
that's good . 
have you had any of those ? 
my wife i think goes 
if you ever get a chance to buy one of those , i think it was , uh , twenty dollars , for , uh , i don't remember how many pounds it was . 
but you cook it in the bag that they send it in . 
oh , really ? 
and all the juices and everything are all sealed in . 
and , i tell you what , it's never failed to come out tender and juicy ,
 oh , i haven't heard 
but with this honey bake that they have , that's the only one i have been able to find there at sam's warehouse . 
it is absolutely delicious . 
oh , yeah . 
and it slices great . uhhuh . 
i'm trying to think of his name of it . 
uh , uh , i don't know , uh . 
i see a can here , a box here of gourmet choice . 
uh , he delivers , uh . 
what is the name of this thing ? 
i got a box ,   distributor , marked on it , 
it doesn't say , gourmet choices . 
but he , 
but it's a company that has , uh , you know , a truck that comes around . 
and they recently had hams . 
they have steaks and , 
i wish i could tell you the name of the company , 
but i don't know what it is . 
but , uh , they recently had a ham , that was supposed to be , 
it was boneless 
 and we tried it . 
it was real nice , 
and it was fully cooked and everything . 
we had it 
it was really great . 
you know , that sounds like it . 
but that's the only ham i have found that i thoroughly , thoroughly enjoy . 
i would like to try the old recipe though , of cooking it , 
to do the different things that we did . 
but i would like to put one in the oven , you know , the old fashioned way and put it in there for hours and hours , and see if , 
because i don't think in my married life , which is , uh , twentysix years now , we've never done that , you know . 
and i remember that when i was a kid , uh , 
ham is just something you have for breakfast occasionally , you know . 
and that's it , you know . 
in the old days , hams were the meal , 
and i don't think we ,
that's true . 
and all those 
that's an interesting point . 
your meals now ? 
have you , 
into that , uh , 
 oh , yeah . 
looking at those things ? 
 and , uh , getting , 
parents , that's unusual . 
well , it's true . 
i think my parents are very unusual because , uh , we grew up in the south , where , uh , you have all the , uh , you know , biscuits and gravy 
oh , yeah . 
and then gradually they started switching over to , uh , plain rice , uh , no gravy . 
that's amazing . 
it really is . 
uh , the finer points . 
but my mother has really high cholesterol , 
so it was 
and they started doing this , like or in about the middle seventies . 
well , that's amazing , 
 uh , yeah . 
they'd go , 
that they have started . 
usually it's the younger people doing it . 
it's true , 
i agree with you . 
 so , it's really neat . 
and , uh , 
of course , i have too , but not like hers . 
and i always get after her about salt and everything else . 
and she just will , i mean , she's going to eat the same way she ate , you know , 
that's right . 
and she just tells , more or less tells me to shut up , you know . 
and , uh , i like to , 
i'm trying to do something about my cholesterol in the same way . 
 uh , it's not the   
i listen to , uh , larry  newarth  on the weekend . 
he's a fitness expert 
and , uh , he talks about , you know , the chicken and the rice 
i think the peanut butter and mayonnaise he would throw away for ever . 
and then he's got me into making eggs without the yolk . 
you know , try that sometime . 
my wife says she can't stand it . 
but , uh , when i make scrambled eggs now , talking about a recipe , 
 say if i have four eggs , not for me , 
but if i'm making four eggs , uh , even for my daughter i'll take out all the yolks but one . 
and it's fine . 
you don't miss it , uh . 
in fact , not eat the yolk at all . 
and you don't really miss it . 
you get the flavor of the yolk , 
but , uh you don't eat it at all , you know . 
you don't , 
they're hard . 
you get like , uh , a bite most . 
and so , uh , for cholesterol , i mean , i'm trying that . 
and it has worked . 
my cholesterol gone down twenty points . 
so , although , 
wow , that's good . 
i haven't gotten on the , margarine and all that . 
i don't know , whether any of that is true , you know .
what can we do about crime ? 
i don't know . 
the one thing that keeps coming to mind to me is that they don't have enough space in the prisons to put people 
and they keep letting out people that have , you know , these horrible records . 
so maybe we need to have more prisons or use the old army bases and make them into prisons or something . 
that's one thing i guess i could think of .
uh , it's definitely a big concern , 
i mean every day it's , you know , all ar , 
we live in a little small town , 
and there's just rapes and murders and burglaries and everything all the time . 
and you just can't get away from it no matter where you live . 
well i , 
so it's pretty scary . 
i'm from butler , 
and i can't say that there's too much of that there . 
um , i know the bigger cities have problems with it . 
uh , i really don't know what we can do about it . 
it's rough , because  , 
 uh , start giving more people death sentences . 
that's the only thing i can think of . 
well even some of the sentences just seem ridiculous . 
i mean you hear about people , you know , six and seven times have committed burglaries 
and they're still , you know , only serving six months in prison . 
so that's definitely something . 
they could have a more automatic sentence instead of having the judge having the choice of like , you know , from one month to ten years or something .
that would be one thing that , you know , i think could help is having the laws be changed so that they were more stiff penalties and more automatic penalties , you know , for certain crimes .
uh , i don't know what they're going to do with the problem because it just keeps getting worse and worse . 
and one things that they're saying , now , 
are you going , 
are you a student 
or are you in the work force 
oh , okay . 
because one of the things that i've heard so much about um , lately is the situations on campus where crime has gone up so much . 
and apparently especially like in date rape , many of the , uh , you know , perpetrators seem to be getting off because the universities kind of cover up . 
and they don't really , 
you know ,
a lot of times 
um , i've heard of a few case up here , 
but i can't say that i've heard of , uh , you know , any significant amount . 
uh , but then again like you don't know how many girls are reporting them or not . 
they say like only one in ten are reported . 
i believe it . 
that's awful . 
so one thing they could do is probably support people more reporting it . 
i know some police agencies try to have women police officers that the women can report to and this kind of thing . 
but i'm sure it's still terribly traumatizing , you know , for people to report it . 
so that's probably something else they could do . 
i don't know , 
it seems like something else in terms of crime is certainly involved with drugs ,
and that's like as long as , 
it almost makes me feel , in a way , like making drugs legalized just to get all the money out of it and not have , you know , 
and so i can go out and work at burger king , you know , for four dollars an hour or whatever , when i can make four hundred dollars a day selling drugs . 
so that's certainly a big problem . 
i don't know what the solution to that is . 
having more drug treatment centers available . 
jeez , i don't know . 
uh . see , you see now i would say that that's a bigger problem up here than even the date rape or anything . 
i know a lot of people that partake in that . 
and i'm not saying they're bad people , 
but i would say that's a bigger problem . 
because it ends up , 
even if it's just kind of like this social drug use , you're still ending up supporting these big drug pin , you know , 
huge amounts , thousand and millions and millions of dollars are getting spent , you know , on higher and higher up ,
and it's definitely got to do with crime . 
you know , you hear about people selling their babies , you know , to get some crack . 
i mean , just , oh , 
gosh , horrible stuff like that . 
one of the things they're doing is they're prosecuting the women who are having these kids that are addicted to crack . 
they said , uh , some of the statistics show like one out of every ten babies being born in these public hospitals are addicted to crack , 
and their moms are crack users . 
so that's , you know , another way of looking at it is as the woman is being a criminal , you know , for doing that to her child . 
so i don't know who's the victim there . 
i mean the kids are the victim , it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted . 
and , it's a very complicated problem . 
i don't envy the government trying to cope with it . gosh . 
 no , i don't either . 
well , i guess that's about all i have to say . 
is there anything else you would want to , 
i can't say that i just know that it's really bad in some areas 
and something's going to have to be done sooner 
i don't know what they can do . 
it's frustrating . 
it was nice talking to you . 
 have a good day . 
you too . 
bye , bye . 
uh , basically i'm at home 
and i have two cats 
i mean my husband's great . 
oh , uhhuh . 
it's wonderful ,
and , and , uh , so i'm about forty and whatever , 
around there , huh . 
so , yeah . 
well , you're just a youngster then .
i'm just a 
i passed the fifty . 
so , you think we're ready ? 
uh , you want to start off ? 
the changes i've seen in women's roles , uh , 
since i am in the forty age , i'm a fifties baby 
and from my mother's generation to my generation uh , it's been a big change . 
very much , yeah , 
and i think you'll have to agree 
 and we didn't really know what the agenda was going to be 
and i think , you know , it got off to a really radical , 
it has a radical fringe to it that , uh , i've sort of backed away from . 
i think all things get started sometimes in that manner . 
you know , they come in that way . 
and , to make a change , you know , you have to make a splash . 
but , to continue in that vein , i think it got a little bit warped and off the track 
but i really do think that women have made a contribution 
and it's okay 
and i think , uh , you know on the other hand , i don't know that men have changed that much . 
so in contrast to the women's changes , uh , you know , the men stay steady , 
 and then the women change around them . 
i hadn't thought much about that , 
but that is true . 
uh , i think men are trying . 
some of them . 
but they don't have a national organization of men ,
very much . 
 and they both have to work 
 and they both have to raise the children ,
 and that , i think has been the downfall of the last ten years . 
you know , the me , oh , 
i don't know , 
the yuppiedom ,
and they wanted to compete with men , 
they wanted to be like men , 
 and that's wrong . 
i think they finally discovered that they don't want to be like men 
they hurt themselves a little bit in that way . 
and so that's , you know , 
they sort of threw the thing back another , you know , ten years ,
but i saw the greatest tshirt the other day , 
i got to get some for all my men friends , 
there you go .
there's a lot of truth in that . 
but , uh , i think men and women both have valuable assets to offer 
 and , you know , we shouldn't , 
we were made differently ,
we were biologically , physiologically , made differently 
and there is great wonderment ,
and , uh , you know , we should respect that in each other 
it shouldn't be destroyed . 
swooshed into one channel 
it's viva la difference  ,
 and i think that you can truly respect the other person , 
i mean , you know , tom is just always saying , what a mystery you are , you know  , you know . 
 well , that's kind of makes it exciting .
well that depends on what day of the month it is . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i guess we've gotten more of a , 
in terms of that , i think we've got more of a sense of humor about each other 
but it's still a challenge being in a marriage and trying to figure out those roles 
i think now when both are working they have a more of a chance of working together because they're starting out that way . 
well , that's a very different way to do , 
 you know , the woman doesn't start off at home ,
because you get set in your ways 
and it's ,
are you married ? 
do you have children ? 
oh , my goodness . 
oh , my . 
they're , uh , 
how did you do ? 
uh , how do you mean that ? .
well , i mean , okay , 
well did you have boys , girls , 
how did , 
uh , we have , uh , two girls and three boys 
and our , 
 oh , my . 
oh , my . 
last week was her first baby . 
oh , how exiting . 
so it's been real exciting . 
i don't know what i would do without my friends having all their kids . 
i just love the babies 
 and since i'm sort of in a medical situation where i can't do that , it's , 
have you been that way long ? 
just eight years . 
the most important years of my life you know .
that's a long eight years , though . 
it has been . 
uh , so there have been major , major adjustments , 
 but that's another story . 
but , you know , my husband has really , really filled in the gaps , 
i mean i , 
that makes a big difference . 
i mean if this is the way it had to be ,
and his being able to , you know , all , all ego aside , do a lot of things 
so , when i say men haven't changed i guess i should look at my own backyard sort ,
well , probably your role 
and the way you are also has changed , though .
oh , yeah . 
that's true . 
i mean i would have had so , 
i had so much guilt to begin with 
and the changes that had to take place , you know , 
and you deal with it the best you can , 
the best you can , yeah . 
they're got a little wobbly and a little shaky there , 
i think the future of this whole thing is going to be what happens with the day care situation . 
that's the only thing i worry about is the child's love and security . 
i think that's being damaged , uh , 
i think , 
i think , 
i do , too . 
i think , uh , 
now can do both . 
they're very capable of working 
but i wish they weren't so many , 
i wish they weren't role models for everybody ,
it really is , yeah . 
it's dangerous for the woman , too , to think that she can do that 
and then when she can't , you know , the failure of that is ,
and she doesn't know who she is 
and she's , 
so many have to work to make a go of it , it seems , 
 or they say they do anyways , 
but i think ones that don't have to , the , 
it's not as much of a stigma not to work as it was for a while there . 
well , you know , i think it depends on what part of the country you're in . 
well , that could be . 
uh , i would almost just say that because , you know , down here in the south 
 and you know , 
you  mean  it's stronger there ? 
uh , oh , yeah , 
much stronger . 
and i think that , uh , you know , career women still have a lot of problems here ,
that's the woman's role , 
 and it's hard for her to , uh , you know ,  watch  her peers be appreciated , i think sometimes , 
but then i'm not there , 
so i don't know that . 
and i have women that do both 
and i see a little jealousy on the part of , you know , the woman what has two little boys 
and she has an au pair , which is a livein college kid working for her 
and then she has her business in the back 
 and then my other girlfriend that has , you know , just runs the whole household herself and just has two kids and goes crazy ,
 and so i see i little bit of that 
and i always wish there was a balance , you know , 
and the other gal i wish she could just get out of dodge ,
but they're both , 
get some peace and quiet . 
they're both different people , too . 
so . you're right about that . 
some people can adjust and have both , do both well , 
 and that's , 
 and others can't . 
that's true . 
that's so true . 
how did your daughter do it ? 
uh , well , uh , i have one daughter that works fulltime . 
she has two little boys . 
and , they seem to do fine . 
she has talked about quitting , you know , and staying home for a few years . 
but then , it's real hard because she's got an excellent job . 
 go ahead . 
so ken , how do you do your family budget ? 
well , we don't actually have a budget per se . 
what we do is , uh , maintain a normal checkbook . you know , like ,
and occasionally it actually balances , .
and , um , a u s air and visa card . 
every dollar we charge is a mile for our frequent flier mileage . 
oh , yeah . 
it's a real good deal actually , if you charge a lot . 
so what my wife and i have taken to doing is charging everything in sight . 
anything we buy , we charge , including groceries and so forth . 
so what we'll do is , 
we actually maintain a , 
we have a checking account that we treat like a savings , 
scratch that , 
we have a savings account that we treat like a checking account . 
and so what we do is , anytime we do or make or charge something , we write it out as if we wrote a check . 
and then at the end of the month all the money to   covered already . 
so we just pay it off without having to worry about any interest or anything . 
that's a real good idea . 
it keeps us hopping . 
see , now i'd never get my wife to be able to follow that . 
before we got married i had money in the bank . 
i owned my own home . 
i put in so much money , each , you know , month towards long term savings , you know , like in , uh , mutual funds and things , you know , 
 and , uh , after i got married , 
it just didn't work anymore . 
she spends a lot . 
she likes to spend on anything and everything .
so , we don't have a good organized system , yet . 
maybe after awhile i'll rub off on her or something .
i don't think , 
 well , you know , you know , you know , what's always good is sort of a  for savings   , where they just take money out of you're pay . 
we did that for awhile where , um , 
we actually still do it with my wife's salary ,
i'm a graduate student . 
so am i . 
oh , really . 
in what field ? 
well , uh , in information systems . 
i'm a voice researcher . 
oh , okay . 
i'm in , uh , psycholinguistics , actually . 
um , but my wife has a real job . 
so does mine . 
what we do is , we take money out of her paycheck each week . 
and at an entirely different bank , that we don't have access to so easily , 
and it goes there 
and it stays there 
and it builds up until we need it for something . 
see , i think we might have to do that .
of course , she looks at what she brings home each week . 
it's going to be hard for her to , uh , not have her own money . because , like now , you know , i put money in the bank and saved to go back to graduate school for two years . 
and now she wants to go back to school , 
but she saved enough maybe to get her through august . 
you know , and that's it . 
and i keep saying , now , laura , you're going to have to save a little money . 
i don't know if my paltry graduate student fees are going to get us through . 
it doesn't work , ken .
my mother always said , "now , don't argue about money" , 
so we don't . 
but , you know , there goes my savings .
but , you know , it's one of those things . 
i got lucky . 
my wife apparently is not a , 
she likes to spend , 
but she's pretty good about things . 
now , see my wife will do things like make clothes . 
one of our big investments that , you know , i was wholeheartedly in favor of , was to buy a sewing machine . because she makes clothes . 
and , you know , a descent sewing machine will really help her out 
and she's already made , you know , presents and gifts and things for , 
you know , so i guess i can't , you know , we've probably almost paid off the sewing uh , 
so i can't complain too much , you know , 
she's good about that . 
and , also , we dine at home a lot . 
you know , she likes to cook . 
so that saves us from restaurants or whatever 
i go to , uh , 
i pay what i think is a lot of money to go to a karate class , you know . 
you know , but you need a hobby . 
but that to her is sort of like a waste . 
that's true . 
but she does her nails . 
i know , 
and those nails are so expensive 
i was so excited when she decided she wasn't going to do her nails anymore . 
i guess she just stopped polishing them because they were yellow . 
and then she waits for them to get their color back . 
and then she'll polish them again . 
i don't know , whatever . 
so she stopped for awhile . 
boy , what a difference . 
they buy nail polish every two weeks , 
it's , uh , 
and lotion , oh , my goodness , body lotion , 
 oh , yeah . 
we spend more on body lotions with sesame oil and all these different things , than , uh , 
must spend more on one application of body lotion than i do on soap for an entire year . 
it's funny . 
she's always soft . 
that's true . 
   , so that's helpful . 
but i think , um , 
i don't know , 
maybe after we're not in school anymore , we'll be much better at saving . 
now do you still own a house ? 
you said you owned one . 
and that's what's really paying for my time unemployed or whatever .
that's great . 
we actually live in two different places right now because she has her job . 
so that makes it hard with , uh , you know , 
we're paying double rent , double utilities , 
 oh , wow . 
 and that makes it sort of expensive 
but see , i live within my , 
and she doesn't .
she doesn't live within her professional income , you know . 
so i just get a , 
that's the killer , two apartments , 
and then even if we want to see each other on weekends , it's twentyfive , thirty dollars in gas , every weekend , 
and that really adds up too , you know , 
so it gets tough , 
i think , we'll , do much better when we're living together and we're only paying one rent and one telephone . 
you know , it will cut our telephone bills , you know , by fourfifths , you know , 
eventually , right . 
i mean you're not going to , 
so it's actually tough this year , 
but it will be better in june . 
she will move in with me in june , 
so hopefully our budget will in increase then . 
have you been married for long ? 
just since december . 
oh , wow . 
so you guys really are newlyweds . 
we're , very newlyweds , 
but that's the , 
we're together probably for , um , uh , very close for about six months before we got married . 
so , you know , we lived within , 
though i had my own house and things , you know , uh , we're still pretty close . 
i knew her spending habits 
and they're about the same  , 
 oh , wow . 
they haven't changed at all , you know . 
never say a word when you're wife spends money" . 
and i was like , well , that's true my dad never said a word , you know . 
i actually encourage my wife to spend money sometimes .
so i say if she wants to go out and buy something , i never argue with her , because she's real good at , you know , sort of   .
i don't argue with her , 
but i just get all , 
it must show in my face . 
must be cringes or something , you know , 
we met half way between , at her parents house 
and , um , she had on a new pair of jeans 
and she'd gotten all new underwear , 
"well , i just got paid ." 
had some money in her pocket , yeah . 
it was there . 
it was burning . 
it had to be spent . 
you know , and i'm like 
and she said everything was on sale . 
oh , oh , that's good , 
at least it was on sale .
that's good honey , 
i'm glad you bought it on sale .
what else can you say ? 
that's right . 
i think , 
you don't notice it . 
i think that's probably a really good idea . 
you know , you don't even think about it if it's gone . 
so , uh , until you really need it 
and then you realize , you've got a couple of thousand dollars built up someplace else . 
see i was , 
i was paid twice a month , 
one paycheck went into savings 
and one went into the checking account that paid the mortgage ,
and it , 
and i was even able you know , to accumulate some savings in a sense in the checking account , because i'm pretty thrifty 
you know . but my wife likes to spend . 
she enjoys , 
so that's fine .
but a 
 for savings   , i'll have to look into that . 
that's been our godsend , you know . 
we've had some sort of major emergencies come up , you know , where , 
we also own our own house , 
 um , we had an ice storm up here ,
i mean , half the city  owned  trees   .
onethird of all vegetation in this county is just wiped out . 
oh , really , because of the heavy ice . 
it broke the limbs . 
we had to   our backyard tremendous willow tree that just fortunately , 
but it cost us , you know , a couple of hundred dollars just to bring the tree down .
plus , we went with a friend , 
and they said you know , 
and then the whole ice storm cost us quite a bit of money , even though insurance picked up some of it ,
they don't get , you know , 
 and that , 
and then we had a car expense like that same week . 
one of the cars died , you know . 
all of this adds up 
and that  for savings  really comes in handy . 
i can see that . 
i can that , 
what happens if something happens to a car , you know . 
oh , well , nothing will happen . 
what type of things would you fix if you're having company come over ? 
well , i have a really great one that i make in the summertime because it's cool 
and uh , it's just really pretty easy . 
it's pretty much dumping things in and stirring . 
and i like that . 
uh , the only thing you have to do is cook the rice that goes in it 
and then you're supposed to do chicken , 
but i just use those little cans of chicken . 
and it makes it so much easier , 
and so you dump the rice , 
you dump the chicken 
and then you put in fruit like pineapple and mandarin oranges and grape , 
now grapes are the ones that you have to pull all that off , 
but i get my kids to do that , 
i don't have to do that . 
um , and it really , 
and you mix it all up with ye , 
there's a little dressing that goes in it that you have to stir up , 
but it's so simple 
and it tastes really good because it's cool in the summertime . 
oh , yeah . 
you serve it cold ? 
oh , yeah , 
that sounds good . 
it has to sit in the fridge over night , 
but it's really good . 
and i like that one . 
usually when we entertain we do something really simple , because i like to visit with my company ,
like , uh , for memorial day we had some friends over 
and we just bought a brisket and marinated it overnight in one of those like adolph's meat marinate ,
oh , that sounds good . 
and it was real good . 
you can buy a fairly cheap piece of meat that way 
and then people think they're eating steak or something .
it really does . 
i know what you mean . 
i don't usually just pass on any recipe that's got more than five or six steps to it because i just know i'll never take the time to do it . 
now spaghetti's such an easy one . 
um , i do that a lot . 
i do spaghetti a lot . 
it seems like most people like spaghetti . 
i don't like to do that real hot though . 
because , um , i don't know , 
i have a real thing about being hot in the summertime . 
i guess . 
well i think when you heat your kitchen up it really makes a big difference ,
i think that's right . 
and , um , we don't entertain that often , 
but when we do , i'm like you . i like it to be fast and easy .
we don't entertain like people from work or stuff often . 
it's usually friends from church and stuff , 
and so it's real easy because you just make one or two things 
and everybody else brings something . 
that's exactly like us , from our church , we just do it , 
oh yeah , 
it's a lot more relaxing . 
i don't know if i could take the pressure of having to you know , put on this really fancy dinner for someone . 
well you see all that on t v 
and i could never be that person . 
uh , i'm just not , 
well i'm pretty laid back . 
and , uh , you know , so my church 
and , uh , she like does her own bread and does her own stuff 
and so when she , um , does food , she really goes all out 
and i don't know how she can do it and be calm .
do you work ? 
do you stay home with kids ? 
i've been working , 
we're going to have a baby this summer , 
and i'm not going to work anymore . 
oh , how exciting . 
so hopefully , i think i'll enjoy cooking more , when i don't have to work all day . 
i don't like to come home and stand in the kitchen and spend an hour fixing something and then have to clean it up 
and by then it's eight thirty or nine o'clock at night , 
well i usually start about six and cook and then eat at seven .
eat at six , yeah . 
and , uh , my family and i , we're a sit down together family . 
oh , that's good . 
uh , yeah , 
i don't like the run in and out part . 
and i like to be able to sit down after school and have them talk with me and my husband about what's happened 
that's neat . 
and , uh , you know we could learn to talk about things 
and i think that's good . 
that really is . 
it keeps the family in touch with what's going on with each other . 
i think , 
right now we eat in front of the t v 
but since it's just the two of us , it's  , 
well that happens to us sometimes too . 
but , uh , sometimes if something , uh , is on that they want to watch i leave it on , 
but we eat in the kitchen 
and their heads are always poking past the door . 
to see what's happening . 
anyway food is , uh , a real lifestyle kind of thing 
and some people don't like to do this 
but i like to uh , cook with my kids . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and if they're going to have other kids over then , then they help . 
and we make real simple things , you know , those , oh , 
i don't know if you've ever made them , maybe not since you don't have kids yet , but those jello , uh , gelatin things you can pick up with your fingers , i can't think of what they call it . 
oh , i've seen those in the magazines . 
they're so simple . 
and the kids love to do that . 
uh , finger food is a biggie with them . 
a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks , because they love to do that 
and it's just really hard 
and if you have to work with a knife , i don't like that . 
so , that's , uh , 
they like to eat it , 
but it's a hard one to have to prepare . 
but they like that with the cool ranch dressing that goes along with that . 
oh yeah , 
we like that . 
that's a good way to get kids to eat vegetables too . 
my son's getting to be a real good cook 
so , uh , 
oh , neat . 
sometimes he fixes me breakfast .
oh , wow , that's great .
i like it , 
i like it a lot . 
how old is he ? 
he's eleven . 
eleven , 
so hi , 
do like you cook a breakfast every morning 
mostly during the summer it's hit and miss 
um , twice a week or something and then have like , when it's really cold , i even cook oatmeal ,
and they like it all right . 
and , um , then sometimes we do something , 
it has to be fast because they're on their way to school , 
we do like eggo waffles and stuff like that , 
oh , uhhuh , 
so , i try to , uh , 
and sometimes we do eggs if i get up early enough to do that . 
i used to do them in the microwave , 
but they don't like that . 
oh , do they get rubbery , 
i've never tried it . 
it depends . 
if you let them cook too long 
you can tell if they've gone to long because they'll turn a little bit gray 
and they will be a little harder , 
and i don't like that . 
so you have to just let it cook a little bit less than what it says in , if you have a microwave book , 
but you cook it a little bit less and then let it sit with like a plate over the top . 
and let it steam . 
and then stir it up . 
and that turns out okay . 
and it's funny 'cause if i turn them out on to like a plate , for them to take what they want , 
it's really funny , 
and yet if they don't ever see it , then it's like , oh this tastes okay , you know , 
we had , 
my grandmother used to do that to us with things like squash . 
everybody would say we don't like squash , we won't eat squash , 
so she would make these fancy casseroles and hide it in there , you know , 
uh  , it's not such a bad idea to think about judges , uh , you know , taking the idea of , uh , uh , sentencing into their hands versus , you know , the jury , especially if it's a highly publicized case such as , uh , you've got cases right now that are going on that everybody's very well informed of or have read , uh , certain , uh , things in regards to cases like the dahlmer case in milwaukee and stuff . 
so it may be an idea to think about , you know , cost . 
trying to find a jury 
but deep down they are against this person or whatever , 
so , uh , i don't think it's such a bad idea to think about . 
that it , 
a judge would be more consistent from one case to the next 
and some of them don't , 
but , uh , this one , uh , 
i was trying to remember back . 
it seems to me that , you know , when i studied civics in 
i didn't think they 
i thought the sentencing was done by the judge . 
i mean , it's either guilty or not guilty . 
and , uh , i guess , 
and i don't know whether it's by state or whether there's been some 
but , yeah , i certainly wouldn't be , uh , uh , worried about that . 
i guess in terms of 
oh , sure . 
uh , in terms of doing away in the trial system . 
that it's got to be a unanimous 
but , uh , just a bare majority . 
that's kind of how i , you know , 
in certain cases i can see them going , uh , uh , just basically with a judge , guilty or not guilty 
and it goes into the court case or whatever 
and it's not highly publicized . 
but when you get into these highly publicized cases where everybody knows details whether it's through the national enquirer 
i'm not going to listen to the facts 
but , uh , also there's aspect of cost 
and i'm not quite sure how much cost it does take for , uh , the judicial system to try and call a jury , whether it's very costly , or if it's something that's not costly or what . 
you know , being that i'm not in that area i really don't know . 
but i wonder 
i know companies have to pay for these people to be off from work . or 
uh , whether it's , 
i think it's with pay . 
if i remember , jury duty is with pay . 
and i'm , 
where i work . 
but , i'm not sure that that's necessarily required . uh , you know , by law that it has to be 
paid , right . 
uh , i suspect that's a benefit of a bigger company . 
but there are 
some that may decide not to . 
well , i don't know if there's going to be solutions to the u s budget . 
well , now it's in pretty disastrous shape for sure . 
it's only getting worse exponentially 
there's , uh , maybe some shortterm things that they can do 
and it hurts everybody's pocket , of course , 
but , um , i know that state has , uh , cutback , uh , raises for a year to help , uh , the , uh , state financial or whatever you might want to say to get better 
oh , which state is that ? 
uh , state of minnesota . 
so there's the potential that perhaps , you know , the u s budget might want to take a look at it's , uh , federal employees and take a look at saying , well , let's freeze wages . 
i mean everybody's doing it so it isn't 
and the only other avenue that i can think of is , uh , looking at where they're spending the money and not so much as saying , well , we're spending too much in that area as perhaps looking at what is costing them the money . 
and it was just , 
 i mean you can go to kmart and buy them for , uh , eight dollars or i think 
i think that there's 
i mean there was , um , people at stanford who were soaking the government , you know , using millions of dollars of research money 
and i think that maybe more widespread 
than we think . 
 but then it's something that's hard to enforce too i'm sure . 
it sure is . 
the , you know , as far as , 
i think there was something with the government official that went on conferences for two days 
and actually , uh , the conferences were nothing 
but , uh , you know , they're getting paid for this , 
and it was something more than just the conferences . 
they were using it as eating out , uh , 
when you think about people , uh , taking vacations these big government officials taking  descendants  in congress . 
the rest of them taking these vacations and using the taxpayers' money for that . 
and it's a real big crunch , uh 
of course , when they get caught then you know , they're guilty of course , 
but , uh , during that time i'm sure there's hundreds of , uh , thousands of people that are , uh , spending money that does not belong to them . 
well , that's right . 
uh , i think that , oh , politicians talk a lot about waste 
 but i'm not sure that that's really that much of the problem . 
i mean when you look at something like the gulf war 
and i don't think , uh , it's ended up being , 
i mean it gave people jobs 
 but i think it also cost , um , quite a bit as far as because after they're done with the war , a lot of things were no longer put to use . 
i mean it was kind of like , okay , we'll do this during this point and time 
but after that you know , uh 
so , a lot of things that are saying that they're no longer going to be doing for next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things . 
well , it was good talking to you 
all right . 
you too . 
bye now . 
what kind of pet do you have , gail ? 
i have children .
oh , you have children .
i have little children . 
both of my kids are under two so right now we don't have pets , 
but we've had lots of them in the past . 
have you ? 
uh , what have you had ? 
well , we had a dog before we moved here . 
uh , and we couldn't bring her with us . 
we came from colorado , 
and we've had hamsters and fish and birds . 
i've   , 
well , you're going to have lots of pets with your children growing up . 
 well , we had a schnauzer that we lost this summer , 
and he was fourteen years old . 
and , uh , we've had two schnauzers 
and before that we had all dachshunds , 
and i think my husband wants another dachshund , 
and we're trying to debate because our children are grown 
 you know , another dog . 
and we do have a very loving cat that's , you know , kind of our baby . 
uh , and we like pets . 
we like them around . 
we have grandchildren that run through 
and they think we should have a dog , 
and that's because they have a great dane .
they're just huge .
well , we , you know , 
um , if it were just more peaceful , you know ,  with  the little ones , we would definitely have a pet . 
i just think it's nice to have around . 
we had a cat   that had kittens . 
so any pet that i get from now on will definitely be spayed or neutered . 
oh , yes , 
because , uh , i did . 
that experience was awful .
i have never wanted to , 
that's why we've never gotten a female , you know , in anything . 
uh , uh , and our male cats , you know , we had ,
  what you doing   ? 
and , of course , he doesn't know it . 
he's still out partying . 
but , um , you know i do think that maybe we'll get a female next time and just have her spayed , you know . 
and , uh , 
well , a lot of times now when you buy them from like the s p c a or 
which i think is a good thing . 
it just breaks my heart to see these poor little old dogs wandering the streets looking starved 
it , uh , 
plus , uh , you know the safety factor and stuff . 
well , we enjoy having pets . 
uh , you know , i think they're a lot of company , 
and when my mother lived with us , uh , the cat was really hers 
and he was kind of wild . 
our daughter found her and brought her to us , 
and , uh , that cat walked in and walked right up to my mother and jumped up and curled up in her lap . 
and she was the only one at first that , you know , could really hold him , you know , because he was really skittish . 
but it was like he knew 
and he would sleep with her , 
and so he was a lot of company to her .
and cats are usually so independent 
but this one you know , he comes up 
and he crawls up next to my husband now , you know . 
you know , before the dog died , we have a queen size bed and the dog would sleep on my side , 
and the cat would sleep .
and when everybody turned we all four of us .
my husband that's one thing he hated was our cat used to sleep with us . 
our dog wasn't interested in even coming in our room , 
but our cat would sleep with us 
and he hated that . 
did he ? .
he just thought that they belong , 
and when she'd walk on the couch along the back behind his head 
so , i guess probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though i love cats . 
i think it would probably be a dog , 
and it would definitely be an outdoor animal . 
i think that's one of the reasons our , 
because as i said our schnauzer was old . 
and so he was becoming incontinent . 
and so then i would just have messes in the house , 
and i think that's one of the things that both of us are not wanting to start over with , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , and it was new carpeting 
and , you know , it just really , you know , upset me no end . 
and , uh , 
oh , that would , greg , uh , 
my husband's grandparents have a dog 
and they just , 
it needs to be put to sleep 
but it's grandpa's dog , 
and , uh , he's really getting too old to take care of it . 
but the dog messes all over the carpet 
and my daughter is just nine months old 
 and so then she crawls on the carpet 
and , oh , the smell i mean 
and that's one real drawback , 
but you know i guess you'll do just about anything for your pet if you love them enough .
you will . 
you know , we were trying to decide you know , about putting him to sleep . 
other problems too . 
and fortunately the decision was just taken away from us which made it a whole lot easier . you know , 
our animals are almost like our kids in some ways , you know , 
and you grieve just as much over them when they go 
and his wife and our daughter and her husband and the grandkids all say , get a dog , get a dog , you know . 
and i can tell my husband , you know , deep down you know , he real , 
brian in plano , texas . how are you doing today ? 
i'm nancy . 
how are you ? 
great , nancy . 
i'm in plano also .
you're in plano also , huh ? 
well , good to hear . 
oh , that was good . 
all right . 
well , good to hear , 
learned about their basketball team .
which one ? 
uh , jazz . 
oh , yeah . 
the utah jazz . 
they're pretty good . 
they've got some 
well , you ready for new year's eve ? 
should we , uh , start this so we can , 
what was your name again ? 
nancy , that's 
and i'm brian . 
well , i'm a little different than other people because i don't have benefits with my job . 
i'm a nurse 
and i 
i float 
so i find that it makes up for what i pay for insurance 
and i make enough money by the hour to make up for that . 
to compensate 
it's cheaper for me to buy insurance by the month than to work staff someplace . 
and then i have my freedom . 
i can work seven days in a row and take a week off or whatever i want to do . 
well , that's an excellent , 
so actually that is a benefit , uh , 
most people prefer the security of nine to five ,
and i'm just really not interested in 
well i guess that's a good point , uh , 
i do belong to a large corporation 
or that where i'm currently employed 
and is health insurance . 
i think through our health insurance that i can get better rates through a group plan 
and that got to be somewhat expensive , 
and especially if you have a family . 
then i think it makes a big difference . 
and that's one thing i do have . 
if i didn't have a family , i don't think i would have , in this stage of my life , 
i don't think i would have insurance , uh , 
i don't think i would go through that expense . 
one other benefit that you mentioned is the flexible work hours 
and in my previous job , i really enjoyed because they had what was called flex schedule where i could go and i could work , uh , nine hour days and have like friday only work four hours 
oh , yeah . 
 or i could do , uh , work four days a week at ten hours a day and have a , you know , three day weekend .
could you change that as you felt like it 
or did you have to do it the same every week ? 
well , basically , yeah 
i had to do , that , uh , the same , uh , for about every quarter of the year . 
i mean 
that was an excellent benefit 
and i don't have that in my current operation , 
but , uh , you mentioned , uh , flexible work schedule 
and that's good . 
and , uh , what other benefits do you think are important ? 
oh , well , i guess ,
that's true . 
i just prefer to worry about today , 
probably not a practical attitude 
but that's who i am 
well , and that's an individual thing . 
uh , with our current , uh , organization , we do have a nice retirement package 
and also an interest , uh , in the company 
and , uh , also , uh , in one of my wife's , uh , companies where she worked , they'd had a real nice profit sharing plan that , 
some of the t v shows i like to watch are , uh , mostly evening shows 
and , uh , like for instance the one i'm looking forward to tonight is twenty twenty . 
i usually watch those prime time programs . 
uh , i like to watch fortyeight hours . 
never miss that and , uh , sometimes prime time live . 
uh , and then the week goes by 
and i don't think i ever watch anything else . 
you know , but basically a lot of documentary things and , you know , what's going on and that kind of thing . 
i have a few , you know , favorite shows that i try not to miss . 
l a law is one of them . 
although this year's , it's a little easier to miss than last year .
it's hard to follow . 
and , uh , i like rosie o'neill . 
oh , i've never seen that one . 
the trials of rosie o'neill with sharon gless . 
i've seen uh , the previews for that . 
it's very good . 
 uh , show . 
but , uh , and then there's a new sitcom on that is , tim allen's , uh , what is it , uh , handyman . 
that's not what , uh , 
home improvement . 
oh , we never miss that , 
or we try not to miss that . 
i thought it was , you know , 
and it had such a good story , too . 
did you see the end of it ? 
well , you know , the little boy , the little one was trying to decide if there was a santa claus . 
oh , that's right 
and the neighbor , 
they thought it was the neighbor . 
he gave the two doubting thomases a rubber band and a paper clip . 
i thought that was wonderful . 
and then , uh , it appeared that maybe it probably wasn't the neighbor . 
and , uh , used to be on sunday nights , now i can't figure out where they've moved it . 
on our , uh , public television , they had a show at ten thirty that was a computer show . 
and it showed the latest , uh , developments from all the computer companies . 
i've never seen that program . 
well , you know , it's , 
unless you're really into computers , and software , you 
it just really gave me kind of an outlook of what was available out there . 
and , uh , you know , 
so you could see what the new developments were and what to look for 
it was just a thirty minute show with no commercials . 
oh , okay . 
public television , course , doesn't have the commercials during the show 
and i like the frugal gourmet . 
oh , i do , too .
but i just seem to miss a lot of these programs . 
i don't know why . 
i just , 
if i can catch them , i do . or if i remember . 
well , there's very few that , you know , my life would stop if i didn't catch . 
but , uh , now i do , 
before i go to work , i tape my soap opera . 
oh , yeah . 
i watch one 
well , i watch two , 
but one's a halfhour 
and one's an hour 
and they lead into each other . 
and that's the bold and the beautiful and as the world turns . 
oh , okay . 
and i've watched the , as the world turns since i was a little girl .
that's been on for years . 
so it's just , you know , 
it's , something i've done for the last probably twentyfive years . 
oh , and so you get to come home and watch them .
so i have freedom to watch 
but uh , the information shows 
and i like the comedies 
i subscribe to h b o . 
well , we , 
so i can get some of the movies . 
that's a good idea . 
we did have h b o , 
but we just canceled it last week because it seemed like it was so repetitious , you know . 
it is . 
it's just , 
but i don't sleep a whole lot 
and i , you know , 
at two o'clock in the morning , there isn't anything on regular t v 
oh , yes , 
if you're up then .
and you don't get good reception without cable 
and it doesn't 
i thought when i got my v c r , i'd probably drop it , you know , 
but that was years , 
say you did , uh , starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one . 
some that , she had to , uh , label everything .
she had to label everything . 
what was she driving ? 
it was a cadillac . 
and uh , well , they quit making those , the  quieter jet  carburetor 
and they quit making it . 
they rebuilt it 
and it never did run right again . 
 quad    not really easy to get rebuilt just right . 
uh , and like , what were you replacing the starters and bendix on ? 
uh , a maverick and also , uh , a chrysler station wagon before that . 
did you replace just the , uh , bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter ? 
uh , the , 
i'm replacing the , two or three starters on the chrysler . 
the starters are kind of fragile . 
and the , 
especially if you need a tuneup . 
they kept saying that's what chryslers did , is they wore out starters . 
well , if they start real easy , you know , you just hit the key 
and it starts up 
 and when it's properly tuned up , that starter will last for a long time . 
see , they built that starter so it would fit every v eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirtyfive years . 
they all take the exact same starter . 
they'll interchange completely . 
i mean completely . 
one starter will fit all of them . 
so they've got a whole lot of torque , 
but to do that , they did it , 
use an underdrive system , 
but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast 
it's kind of tough on the bushings . 
usually what goes is the bushings . 
you take a little time , replace the bushings , you still got a perfectly good starter . 
but , uh , most places with good enough bushings . 
so it's , you know , 
after you get rebuilt one , you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly , especially if you need a tuneup . 
anyway , what are you driving now ? 
uh , my chrysler van 
and it's pretty maintenance free , you know , 
and , uh , at the beginning of the year last year drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon 
and it didn't give me any trouble at all . 
that's good . 
it was a late model , 
is that chrysler van ? 
one of the little mini vans ? 
is a , 
do you like the way it rides and stuff ? 
rides rough ? 
well , yeah , 
it runs good . 
you know , i kind of , 
it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine . 
you have to kind of wait for it , especially when you get on the highway . 
right now , without getting some of the sportier models , uh , the four cylinders aren't real peppy . 
but , uh , they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years , too . 
you driven american cars all , 
uh , yeah , 
i drove a volkswagen beetle for a while , about a month . 
uh , in a month i think i put , uh , three oil coolers on it . 
uh , every time i turned around i was having trouble with it . 
everything else i ever owned was american built . uh , mostly older cars . 
uh , i've been a mechanic , 
well , i starting working my father's service station when i was about , uh , twelve . 
so , i've been around cars a lot , but , uh , driven a lot of old pontiacs . 
my first three cars were , uh , seventy model pontiacs . a g t o and a bonneville and a station wagon . 
i had a couple of chryslers . 
had a super b for a while with a four forty in it . 
it was a lot of fun . 
but , uh , 
not much gas mileage , though . 
i don't know , 
gas mileage wasn't too bad . 
it got about seventeen . 
oh , wow . 
well , till you got crazy with it . 
you know , you get the four barrel all worked up 
and suddenly it drops off fast , 
didn't have to work too hard to move the car around . 
now , do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs ? 
oh , yeah , 
my last g m car was a seventy chevy station wagon 
and it still had the points and condenser in it . 
when i rebuilt the engine on that , about a hundred and thirty thousand on the car . 
i , uh , pulled that old points distributor out and got , an h e i electronic distributor put into it . 
well , i really enjoy reading the newspaper , 
we get the daily , uh , dallas morning news 
and i try to look at it . 
if i get busy i don't get a chance to pick it up , like this week i noticed several copies haven't been touched 
but  , 
well , do you have time to read the paper in the morning ? 
but , uh , if the , 
well , i have two children 
and if they , uh , go out to play or something i like to keep my eye on them so i'll , you know , maybe go outside and read the paper while they're playing or sit in a chair by the window or something . 
you know , a lot of people don't take newspapers at all . 
we took the morning news for a while , 
and then , uh , well , we've been taking the times herald for ages 
and then , uh , dog just ran off with my shoe , that's off the subject , 
anyway , uh , and then we switched the morning news 
but we found we couldn't read enough of it 
and by the time i got home and had time to read some , 
but i do like to watch , uh , c n n . 
i have several chores and things to do , 
so it comes on at , like nine o'clock p m 
and so i will turn that on while i'm doing some work 
and i can hear the news , not have to sit right down and listen to it . 
the news coverage ? 
i mean yes i did hear that 
and so , uh , i do try to keep that in mind that whenever you're reading a paper it usually has a particular flavor . 
well any , you know , time magazine and even the news that , 
sometimes that , 
that's why i like some diversity the idea that , which we take from time to time 
and we , 
the problem is they call up and make this deal , you know , 
and we also hit the garland , garland daily news , 
i guess it comes out sporadically , like ,
but i think what's interesting is as much as they try , they put some bias , 
i had the chance to hear tracy rowlett speak to a group 
and it was interesting that they think that they're basically impartial . 
and that , 
well , i would really say that that's not true , because uh , it seems like certain newspapers always espouse certain candidates , 
and , so , uh , news stations always tell the story from a certain angle 
and that's why it's a good idea to get a wide variety of coverage so that you get a lot of different opinions . 
you may never get the truth , 
but you'll have a variety to choose from . 
and as , uh , a ploy . 
which was , uh , 
i find that fascinating that , uh , 
i do , too . 
do you ever listen to the radio 
or any , 
and i actually listen to c n n radio . 
do you know it was on radio now ? 
it's on eleven ninety . 
um . i really , uh , have gotten out of the habit of listening to the radio from any kind of , even music 
and , uh , 
well , when i go to work i listen . 
my husband does 
but i've got out of the habit of listening to the radio . 
well , with your , you know , 
if you're around the home , though is that about twenty minutes of news radio , or thirty minutes is 
and then they start repeating everything . 
and so it's kind of a , oh , 
that's what's interesting is the c n n , uh , 
i don't think , i'm trying to think if it's much local . 
i listen to a little of that 
and i listen to a little of ninety point one . 
i'm inveterate switcher . 
that and ninetyeight point seven , i'm eclectic approach . 
do you have a particular local channel that you watch ? 
but that has to be , 
that's another bias . 
that has to do with the weather reporting . 
i'm not sure that , 
actually i think channel eight is probably , 
but i know dave fox , 
he goes to our church 
um . well we're fairly new to the area 
and so we're still shopping  ,
well the ,
and apparently channel eight was way down 
and now they have turned it all around and done a pretty remarkable job 
and then they've been some people move around 
and , uh , john chriswell is , anyway , the , 
i don't know , 
do you seem to , 
can you tell much difference between the local radio , t v stations ? 
i noticed on channel eight that there's all of the , uh , anchors , seem to be like white anglo saxon protestant type people 
and they all seem to be , you know , fairly similar 
and i kind of prefer you know , some females , 
i don't recall that they have any female anchors 
and i like the anchors to be different kinds of people . 
i think that adds to the diversity , 
i think that , uh , i like that . 
uh , there , i know , you know , john wylie price , 
i don't know if you kept up , 
but he's been protesting , 
and , uh , i prefer you know to have a little bit of variety like that because i think you're more likely to get , 
and i think he has legitimate argument . 
i mean you can , uh , 
i grew up in alabama 
and so i have some prejudices . 
but a justice standpoint , because we have the option of not watching that station . 
uh , i'm totally in favor of affirmative action in some of the programs 
but i think that , uh , in some cases this should be some real opportunity 
and i think that , dallas , it turns out , though from what i understand , has quite good , 
i occasionally go to saint louis . 
and , uh , there for a few days and watch the news have quite good news . 
i think channel eight is the number one , uh , a b c affiliate in the u s . 
i think tracy rowlett was saying that he , 
oh , really ? 
course he pumping his own  , 
well , we , you know , 
like all of the stations seem to be pretty good , 
it's just we haven't found one that we've snuggled into . 
where'd you move from ? 
so we had a favorite , 
or i did , have a favorite channel that i usually tuned into for local news . 
i guess because you get use to , you like the anchors , 
and you feel comfortable with them 
it is interesting though , 
it becomes a little of personality . 
in fact , the guy that was on , the weatherman on channel eight worked for me , oh , long time ago ,
we got here fourteen years ago 
and , uh , they had fired him , uh , because he was too t , 
anyway , he didn't have the personality ,
and that's interesting . 
that's what the t v stations do . 
they're trying to get ratings . 
that's true . 
and i think ,
their job . 
that's true . 
so that really effects how they report the news . 
well , it's like sometimes a little too cutesy 
is he the sports , 
i guess it is time to close now , so i can run go help put the kids to bed . 
well good talking to you . 
are you a t ier ? 
oh , really . 
but , are you at t i ? 
oh yeah . 
so you have to do the random drug testing . 
oh , yeah , 
in fact with me , it's not much to talk about , 
i'm so much for it . 
i don't really have much to comment about it . 
how many times have you called , 
or have you been participating in this ? 
oh , about ten or eleven calls . 
oh , you got ten , 
this is about six times . 
as contract person we have to do random drug testing , too . 
it doesn't bother me . 
i don't feel like it's really a violation of privacy or anything . 
i think it's good . 
in fact , i don't know what the statistics were , 
but i think that they were surprised to find it so low . 
i think they were expecting to find , uh , like the national average at t i . 
and i think it was tremendously down . 
but i think that when i was at t i of course , we had all the information before they started . 
and they said that a certain number of people that the heavy drug users would either quit or go in rehabilitation programs . 
and i think that's what helps , you know , that in the warning that you have a drug program , the people that are worried about it or are taking drugs , actually go 
and then usually a lot of them partake in some of the benefits of rehabilitation and everything . 
so that's real beneficial for the company and the employee . 
and our numbers have been way down . 
i don't know what they were . 
when i worked for the temporary agency as a permanent person , 
and so we had , 
when we sent temporaries to t i , we had to have their drug tested . 
and we did have a couple of cases where the person said that they hadn't used anything , 
and their test came back positive , 
and normally we didn't retest them . 
but there were a couple of people that we really thought that they were telling the truth 
and we retested them like the next day , 
and they came back negative 
oh , really . 
so that's the only thing , i think , that might be a little bit of a problem . 
oh , you're , 
that's a good point , 
but at t i before they had the testing , i've forgotten , seems like it's a year ago september , something like that , they told us that the agency that did it was the one that did it for the government . 
and , of course , that's critical , just as the point that you brought up that whoever does your testing's got to be , you know , have a lot of quality control , that they keep track of everything . 
they don't make mistakes . 
that would be terribly embarrassing 
and they were not . 
and i haven't heard of any , 
now i'm not in personnel or anything . 
but , uh , they say that there , it's almost down to zero where people come back and say they are positive and they're not . 
in other words , there's very few mistakes , 
and that , of course , has got to be critical . 
it's got to be , if you have a drug testing program , 
it's got to be with a very , very good agency . 
you don't just have some local group do it . 
it's got to be a highly qualified agency . 
not just some doctor's office somewhere . 
you don't want to do that . 
it's got to be a laboratory that does quality control and double check . 
and i think that t i is latched themselves up with an established group . 
and that would be good for any company that does it , and not to have just a very casual thing . 
it's got to be with a , you know , first class , totally independent agency . not local of course . 
ours , well i think it was in the south somewhere , 
but it wasn't even in dallas , you know , the one that did us . 
oh really . 
huh . do they have a policy where they counsel people if they come back positive , 
or do they fire them right away . 
oh , no . 
they have one chance to then go in a program . 
you come back positive , you have one chance to go in , and go into , they have a lot of , uh , rehabilitation , both for alcohol and for drug use , 
and uh , they have an agency where you can go for personal problems , financial or whatever . 
and so they don't , 
it's , uh , definitely trying to encourage people to rehabilitate . 
in fact , again , before you go , you know , that's why i said , when they first started it , they had a rehabilitation program in effect that said if you worried about this and you may have taken drugs , go ahead and get rehabilitated first , 
and they won't say anything about it . 
i think that's really good . 
oh sure . 
i know some places just fire people on the spot if they come back positive or something . 
oh yeah , 
that's not right . 
it's really an illness , or whatever you want to say that it is . 
you know , it's a weakness and all , 
and all of us have weaknesses of one kind or another . 
and i think that those people that have that and however they got into it , 
i have children , 
i always worry about the classical thing that you see on t v , where the drug pushers give it to the kids for free , you know , and get them sucked in , 
and then they sell it to them . 
you know 
i always worry about my teenage daughters going to some party 
and they slip it to them . 
i don't know , 
i don't even have that much knowledge to know whether that would get them addicted or not , you know . 
that's a real worry . 
some of the stories you read about cocaine , that's like people try it one time and they're addicted . 
my husband is a counselor , 
and he works , mostly with adolescents . 
oh , you know a lot about that . 
so yeah , 
but most of the time it's they get into the wrong crowd first , 
and then they start a drug problem . 
it's usually not a one time accidental thing , i don't think . 
i know , 
i'm glad of that . 
and i have , knock wood , pretty good luck , or very good luck with my daughters so far , 
i have one daughter still at home . 
one's at u t 
and one's at home , gets dozen calls a night . 
oh , well i'll let you go if you want to go ahead and take that , 
i don't care about that , 
she'll be on the phone all night . 
it seems if you watch what kind of crowd that start running around with and kind of keep up with who their friends are 
do you have children ? 
we're expecting a baby 
oh , great , 
so we're starting . 
fantastic experience . 
i've got two , as i said , i've at u t now in austin , and one at home , 
and i always say that i've learned so much more from them than i ever taught them . 
it's a fantastic experience . 
oh , we're really excited about it . 
oh yeah . 
you know , one thing my husband believes is if you suspect your kids are having any kind of problems , he believes you should take your kids in for a random testing , like on a saturday morning , if they've been out at a party friday night . 
if you're not too sure what's going on , he tells parents all the time , haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked . 
the key thing that i think , that we try to do , is that bring all the friends over here . 
have our house as a place where they can come at any time , so that you always see their friends 
and they're always over in someone else's house . 
so we've been lucky that our house is usually the place where the kids could come , you know . 
i think that's a really good thing to encourage . 
and then you can make judgments and make comments or whatever you want . 
but at least you see what's going on , 
and you always have your house welcome , then your children think that , you know , you're cool parents and all that . 
oh well , thanks . 
my wife was talking in my ear , 
she reminded me to say that they're very cheap until they get to start driving . 
and we have one , of course , i say , in college driving . and one going to drive this summer , 
so kids cost you practically nothing , because you always get so many things from your relatives and everything . 
but you wait until they go and get a car , insurance , that's when they get expensive . 
as they get older 
and then slowly but surely starts to creep up when they start to take lessons , 
but it's well worth it and everything . 
uh , yeah , 
i think it'll be neat . 
be a great experience really . 
i thought i was cut off there . 
you know , i don't have much to say about drug testing . 
oh , okay . 
well that great . 
it was good talking to you . 
byebye now . 
well , wayne , i've never done any , uh , auto repairs myself at all . 
i mean , i may have screwed in a little  , screw that looked like it was falling out on the door or something 
but , uh , i personally haven't done anything . 
maybe i've , uh , changed wiper blades or something 
but i have noticed since , uh , i got married that my husband , he hates to do auto repairs , 
but he would rather do them himself than to pay someone else . 
i guess , he can't make himself pay someone to do the repairs when he knows how to do it , 
and he'll do it . 
so , he hates the time that he takes , 
but he has changed , um , the brakes 
and he has done all of the tuneups 
and the   like that 
and recently he changed the steering mechanism in  the  car . 
i was really impressed with that .
we had to have it to get the car inspected , 
it wouldn't pass inspection 
and so , he priced around 
and everyone wanted several hundred dollars for it 
so , he thought , well , i can get one in a junkyard  , for like fifty dollars , which he did 
and then , he did it 
and , so , i guess , uh , he's been pretty good about keeping our cars up , 
uh , what's your experience been like ? 
well , uh , i have a long experience with cars . 
uh , when i was younger , uh , my brother had a corvette 
and i bought a corvette 
and when you have a corvette you more or less do all the work 
and i've done everything from build the motor from uh , you know , the bare block on up . 
and , i'm the same way as your husband is when it comes to my car , i hate to go pay somebody good money , you know , 
i hate to pay somebody twentyfive dollars on hour for something i can do myself . 
it just , to me it makes absolutely no economic sense to do that . 
in fact , i , um , just this past weekend put new plugs in both , uh , my car an my wife's car . 
and so , uh , i pretty much try to troubleshoot and do everything i can do myself 
but i've gotten to the point in my life , um , you know , i just crept over forty years old , where i don't want to crawl underneath the car anymore .
that makes sense . 
i mean i've just reached a point , you know , 
it's real rough in the winter time . 
huh , yes . 
and , uh , so , i try to make sure that , uh , by the time fall runs around , because we actually have winters here on the east coast , um , 
and , uh , then springtime i usually end up giving them , uh , a tuneup and make sure that they're running well , 
and , uh , you know , it's like i had the muffler go out on my car , shortly before it was required to go , 
in maryland they have , uh , emission tests . 
and you're required to get your car and go through the emission test , 
well , my muffler , of course , starting going bad right before i was supposed to go to the emission test , 
so . you know , i had to do that job , 
and of course , that was back in december when it's nice and cold outside .
i'm sure it was . 
but the thing was that i could do the job myself , 
i mean , the parts cost me , oh , roughly a hundred dollars . 
um , if i'd taken it someplace and have it done it was going to be three hundred twentyfive . 
 now   like  who's got that extra two and a quarter  , 
i know i don't . 
well , that's exactly the way he feels is that , he really hates to spend the time , 
it takes a lot of time 
if he thinks it's going to be two hours , it's four if , you know , whatever , it always takes him twice as long . 
but then when he's finished he always says , well , now you owe me three hundred dollars .
and then he thinks that he has the money that he can spend on something 
and he hasn't given it to someone else . 
so , he gets some satisfaction out of that although , generally i think he does not look forward to or anticipate , 
there's some people that enjoy tinkering around on cars . 
there's a lot of people 
and he just isn't one of them . 
uh , i don't mind it , 
um , there was a time when i had my corvette , 
i mean , of course , i loved it , um , 
but if , you know , 
i've got other interests now 
and there's a lot , other more important things i think i should be doing with my time . 
and i have the same problem , 
i mean , you can tell him from me 
but it doesn't matter , 
i mean , i've had greasy fingernails for years .
and it still takes me twice as long as i think it's going to take to do the job , 
so , but , i think the difference is that , uh , when you own the car you take more care in what you're doing , 
and you want to make sure that it's done right and put back together right , 
and , you know , i've in the past i've had brake jobs done by someone that when i went back and looked at it some months later i'd find something drastically wrong with it ,
and when you have a vehicle that's being used by , you know , other members of your family , you know , you don't want that kind of a situation to come up . 
and it's very , very difficult to find a mechanic these days that you can trust . 
i only have one guy that i know that i trust to work on my car . 
and , uh , he's about sixty miles from here . 
and so , it , 
and if i have something that's really major that i can't handle or feel i don't have the time to handle , i'll take it to him to do it . 
you know , that  it's , uh   , really has a bad reputation is to feel have rightly so , i think been cheated many times , 
um , and well , i know once when we had a , 
we usually   inspection time we find out there's something wrong with our car 
but , um , once the muffler needed to be changed 
and , uh , he had looked at him himself 
and , but we saw a commercial for like fourteen or twenty dollars or something for a change 
so , he went in 
and , uh , but when they quoted him a price they really wanted fifty or something . 
anyway , but the car that the muffler people had , um , at least my husband felt that they had damaged the muffler further , you know , 
they had punctured a big hole in it when it really could have just been patched or whatever , 
and so , since then , i don't think he's ever even seriously considered you know , any kind of job he thought he could do himself . 
but , i know from his childhood , he says that his father always buys and restores cars just as entertainment , i guess . 
and , um , so , kelly growing up , that was a good way on saturday's that he developed a good relationship with his father . 
and so , you know , something that they did together , 
and he thought that turned out pretty good because you know , it helped him to understand and be functional now , 
and it helped him to have a close relationship , 
so , that's one way he looked at it . 
that's probably , uh , uh , something that , uh , you know , is good for both of them . 
i know that , uh , my older son i could never get him interested in cars 
and i couldn't , you know , 
i just like , you know , 
you sure you're a boy , 
i mean , your not interested in cars , 
i mean he just would not have anything to do with them . 
and , uh , later on and like when he , you know , grew up , got out of the house , got his own car , um , he didn't know how to do anything to it . i mean , absolutely nothing . 
i mean , he couldn't even check the oil . 
i mean , that's how uninformed he was and disinterested . 
and , i guess there are some people out there like that , um , you know , 
i always thought maybe , you know , if he took more of an interest and , you know , what i was doing 
and maybe we could have communicated better . 
but , uh , yeah , 
i think that's great . 
it didn't always work . 
well , um , i feel like i could myself , do some things but , that i have enough responsibility that if i have someone like my father when i was living at home , and my husband , that's willing to do it , i go ahead and let them do it . 
i don't feel the need to , um , you know , be a feminist on that issue and say i can take care of my own things . 
so , i haven't tried to do a lot myself . 
uh , i trained in doing things , 
in fact , uh , when i , uh , first transferred down to , uh , texas instruments back in nineteen eightyseven ,
and , uh , it was an interesting experience for her . 
i mean , she'd always assisted me and done some other things 
but for her to actually get in there and do it herself a little different . 
it's a good experience , 
and i know what's going on 
i think it's important that everyone know , you know , basically how the darn engine works , 
it helps you figure out what's wrong with it ,
i've been out with my sister before when , you know , her car died on the highway 
and i happened to be with her and managed to get her to the other side of the road because it was dark and all , 
oh , okay , 
sounds good . 
i'm ready when you are . 
hold on . 
 are you there ? 
i can't believe i did that . 
hold on . 
that's okay . 
um , i don't know , 
are you in your thirties , 
oh , okay . 
 well then i can tell you that roles have changed . 
i'm thirtyeight  , 
 and they changed quite a bit . 
 um , i , 
this was my twentieth high school reunion , in chicago . 
and basically , um , the choices , i mean , you know , 
you probably heard that in the fifties women liked to stay home and all that . 
that's kind of , um , the opposite of what it was in the sixties and early seventies . 
it was sort of just to um , go protest , 
 and , uh , just , everybody be damned and live with some one , 
and , you know , 
i know that , th , 
i know that , uh , to make a move as far as individuals . 
um , uh , before that a lot of people that wanted to protest were large groups like , uh , black people , or , you know , just large , large groups of people , 
but the , 
it was more civil rights oriented ,
and i think the women's movement kind of brought in individual lives where you had women's movements 
and you had gay movements ,
it did . 
 and i think since then is when a lot of the women's roles have started to change . 
it did 
and some of the other stuff that , um , i think that changed it , if you were assertive you were a libber , 
or you were aggressive not assertive and independent . 
 and in terms of the corporate community , i've seen a big change in terms of men finally being quote , unquote , used to women ,
 so i think that's good . 
i think that , uh , you know , you can just look at home life and see , i've been talking to a lot of people about education and things ,
and i think that a big thing that effects it is that the mother is not home anymore ,
she used to be a rock , you know , 
the mainstay , 
and , uh , since everyone is going out and working now , whether it be because of finances or just the economy ,
and restructuring , stepfamilies , 
and the children are , 
i think a lot of society is suffering . 
not to say that women shouldn't , you know , go out and do what they want to do 
but i think that , um , 
and they're not quite used to it yet 
and that's i , 
the schools or the parents , 
um , i'm trying to think of what else . 
i have a lot of opinions on this except all of a sudden i went blank .
a lot of the things , um , the demographics do , 
i mean , there are more , 
i don't have the numbers in my head right now , 
but , a lot of the things that brought feminism , i mean there are just more women in the demographics , just generally ,
 i mean , i'm the typical baby boomer , 
i hate that term , 
 oh , yeah . 
 but in terms of women , 
what's it like to be twentythree as a woman today , 
i mean , when i was twentythree the issues were either go to graduate school or get married , 
 um , those were the general issues . 
and he asked me if i had any kids . 
he was about forty or fifty years old 
and i said no , i'm just twenty , 
he was ancient , 
 and i said no , i'm just twentythree ,
and i just , 
my mind just went , 
you didn't know what you're going to be missing . 
because doesn't even occur to me right now to have children , 
i don't have any either 
and i've been a married for eleven years , 
and it just , you know , 
i think that i'll probably have children when i'm about thirty , thirtyfive , something like ,
when it's time , 
i'm trying to go somewhere , and , 
you want to establish , 
and it's going to take me a while to move up . 
 and i don't need anything kind of holding me back , um . 
and you'll find that that's the other big thing that has changed in terms of ,
i was twentyseven when i got married 
and i just at the time , um , 
my husband actually even jokes about it . 
he was twentythree when we met 
an i was at a point where it was like , i didn't date , 
i mean , i just , went out to have a good time , 
 but i didn't have to have male companionship . 
um , and a lot of the , um , friends that i had in school at that point , who had gone back and gone to law school , or m b a programs ,
but then by the time i got married , um , 
so , i guess that's a big change in terms of , just , um , the attachments that women feel like they need to have , the dependency ,
it's just really not there anymore . 
 and uh , women seeing other women , you know , 
you know , maybe ,
she's probably , 
let's see my mother's in her early sixties , 
she's , she's about forty . 
 i'm thirtyeight , 
your mother's for , 
i just turned thirtyeight . 
 um , yes 
i'm laughing , 
it does start to creep up . 
um , but it's okay , 
don't ever let age , 
i mean , i don't thi , 
nobody talks about it for women except other women and other men . 
i just turned twentythree , uh , 
i just , 
because me , myself , i just like to move really , really quickly . 
i like to , 
anything i do , 
i got out of school quick . 
you know , 
i want to move up quick . 
i want to make money quick . 
i want to retire quick . 
 and so anything , 
 when the age creeps up , where i'm twentythree and twentyfour ,
but i'm actually very , very young . 
you are , because what i was going to say is , what you will find is , my background is in journalism and corporate communications , 
 and what you'll find is , 
i mean , i'm just now finally to a point where , 
i mean i don't know why i didn't do it sooner , 
 but this is probably typical of the women's movement too ,
i'm seriously considering going back to school for law .
 but it's still is a different application . 
and i mean , if you think about it , you know , i still can have another career . 
i mean i've worked for over fifteen years in what i've done . 
 and i mean , so when you're saying quick , um , i think that's probably one thing that your generation coming up after mine ,
they have to eat real fast 
they have , 
they have to just go through everything . 
 and you'll find that probably by the time your twentyeight , thirty , if you haven't slowed down ,
do you know what i'm saying ? 
um , because it's just , you find out that you're really not , um , smelling the roses , 
and i know that sounds trite ,
i think a lot of , uh , people probably feeling that way , 
i know , i'm probably feeling that way because everything's geared towards young .
and whether i want to realize it or not , everything on television is young ,
 oh it is . 
you can't be a model after thirty , 
you can't do this after twenty , you know 
that's right . 
and so i feel like i'm old . 
it's like i sing , 
and i would really love to become ,
but i think i'm too old now , 
 oh , you're not , 
 and i'm twentythree , 
 because everyone i've seen coming up , they're fifteen .
that's true 
i mean , it's , 
and so i'm going , i'm so old 
you're extremely , 
it's ju , 
 and , you know , so it's , 
well it's like us , we're getting ready to do , if possible , for an adoption 
and i have friends that say well why would you do that ,
and , um , it's just individual choices . 
i stopped comparing myself a long time ago to somebody who had , um , 
in my family my brother's children , 
 i mean , he just turned forty , 
his children will be out of high school before he's fortyfive . 
um , i mean that's like your mother , 
look how young she is ,
it's just , it , 
but what you find is you don't compare the woman , because you just get into trouble . 
it's all independent and choices . 
very true . 
um , but what i was going to say about mothers is , uh , your mother probably just won't say it , 
you went to school , 
you can do this , 
you can do that , 
we couldn't do that then . 
because i'm not married and because i don't have children . 
i'm out of school , 
i'm twentythree , 
i can do anything i want to do , anything . 
 and so , i mean even some days i'm looking for another job now , 
but , and i get so depressed not because i can't find a job , but because i can't figure out what i want to do . 
and that's normal , 
i mean , 
 and yeah , 
and i thi , 
i have so mu ,
that's exa , 
not a lot of people , 
 but it's depressing too . 
 i mean , 
what do you that you're , 
i'm a freelance writer right now . 
 and then , um , what i'm doing is working at , um , an electronics company ,
and then i'm also , 
actually , i'm excited , tomorrow i have a , uh ,  luncheon  appointment with a perspective client to do ,
huh , okay , 
i'm a news reporter , now , 
 oh you are ? 
 and what i'm looking for is something in , i really don't want to stay in news , 
but i would like to stay in journalism , 
 and i've been looking for something exactly like that jus , 
here's what you shoul , 
did you go to baylor by any chance ? 
 oh , okay , 
that's even better . 
 and i just happen to work at a waco station , because you know . 
i went to , 
broadcast news , t v , 
uh , my journalism degree is in , 
are you still there ? 
it worked out fine . 
well , we just ate out , um , had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late 
and we had italian , um , 
have you ever been to the olive garden ? 
is that good ? 
well , do you really like italian food ? 
it's not my favorite 
then don't , 
then this will probably , 
i mean this isn't really excellent italian food , 
that sounds terrible to tell you to go somewhere where it's not that great 
but it's , um , 
 you're not going to believe this 
that's okay . 
 but my , um , softball unit here .
it wasn't that bad , 
actually it's very good it's all of these   run adult males , 
which i'm not italian , 
 , it's all the garlic bread and all the ,
oh , that sounds really good . 
so it wasn't too bad it really wasn't 
but i was more in the mood for french toast any way 
but do you have any favorite ? 
well are there just the two of you ? 
uh , yes , 
well , when my husband and i go out we have four children . 
oh , you're kidding . 
so that makes a difference . 
for us when we go out with the kids obviously we want to go somewhere that we can , 
the fast food ones are probably the ones they like the best . 
oh , sure . 
but we don't like to go there because that's the most expensive , 
so we like to go to a pizza place where you can buy a pizza for one price and feed the whole family ,
you can usually get a variety of what you're looking for ,
but when my husband and i go out we like to go somewhere with a little atmosphere 
and we usually head on down , um , oh what's the freeway down here ? 
uh , six thirtyfive ? 
and that freeway there are restaurant 
but one of our favorites is pappasito's . 
oh , yeah , 
pappasito's . 
we love to go there . 
we went there on my birthday in march it's great . 
you know it always kills me cause i don't like the decorations so much 
it's too , 
too much like a bar naturally ,
i know , 
i've seen it . 
but i love the food , 
the food is probably , 
the food is great . 
i'm not a i'm mexican food gourmet by any means 
but it's probably the best tasting , 
i don't know would you classify that as texmex ? 
um , the shredded beef the type of ,
i like to get that , uh , 
it's a shrimp dish , 
 and i don't remember the name of it , 
 but it's rolled up into something , 
and oh , it's really good . 
i've never had anything there that wasn't delicious . 
they are really good . 
even though you have to stand in line and all of that , that's the only thing i don't like about it too 
it's a little bit with the meat market atmosphere , you know . 
even though we don't have kids we've been married long enough to , um , not be around that . 
um , i'm trying to think of what else we like to eat . 
the one thing i notice is it's just , um , about dining out that you probably can relate to with four children and two of us getting ready to adopt , i mean we find prohibited ,
i mean lunch today was eighteen dollars . 
it's very expensive . 
i don't know how you feel about that 
but i think that some of it's over priced . 
it is i don't know , um , 
sometimes mark and i , that's my husband mark ,
it's a chinese ,
 oh , yeah , 
my husband likes that . 
off of arapaho down there ? 
august moon , 
but chinese isn't my favorite 
i don't like it at all usually 
but he likes it kind of 
so he  heats us up a good fight  
now , me i'm like i said seafood i'm , 
i like that . 
i love seafood , 
 and i like a lot of different ethnic foods . 
i like japanese food . 
there's a place on greenville called  sagar's  .
well , we haven't been in years down near  presby   , 
and i had a meeting down there today 
and i saw that 
and i said , gee i remember that they offer you , um , authentic japanese feeding ,
and i remember when we went  ,
and , um , i had never had saki . 
but if you're looking for a very , uh , 
it's very pretty inside , 
is it ? 
 and the girls wear kimonos and ,
oh , how nice . 
um , but what other kind of foods , 
gee i don't know 
we went to a place called grishman's in greenville ,
i don't know that place . 
was it ? 
they had a great desert bar . 
there's a lot of nice barbecue places here , 
now , i like barbecue okay , texas barbecue . 
i like ,
it's good . 
have you ever been to i think it's called spring creek barbecue ? 
that's real good , 
they are good . 
there had , 
oh my husband's going upstairs , 
and he says free ice cream .
free ice cream , 
i didn't know they had that . 
i can't talk i had chocolate bavarian tort , for desert ,
and it was wonderful . 
just to die for exactly . 
it was , 
in fact if i could pick my , um , restaurants on how their coffee is and how their french bread is and the butter and the desert i would be , 
in heaven .
and how are your kids at an age where they can contribute to what they want 
or do you still order for them ? 
well , my two littlest , 
i just had a baby , 
 oh , congratulations . 
 and she's six months 
and then my four year old he still , 
but my other older two they can . 
my littlest girl she's still like wants mcdonald's , mcdonald's , mcdonald's .
every child that i even know that eats vegetables , um , looked five years old still after a certain age realized that there is something called a mcdonald's . 
oh , i'm telling you . 
it's really sad isn't it cause it's hard to get them away from junk then . 
well , it's kind of funny is sometimes like we all want different things , 
 and so there's a h avenue down here ,
i know where that , 
that's all , 
so we all get to go to our own little thing and drive through and get our own thing , 
 and then we go to park over there so we can all have our own . 
 well , that's all right as long as , 
that's on the nights we can't decide . 
i was going to say because with six people how do you , um , 
cause with two we have a problem , 
i mean i can't even imagine , you know , trying to , um , 
you sound like you're doing pretty well with four children . 
well , five of them , they're good ,
that's the way the , 
well , we're getting ready to 
but it's just on my mind , 
we're getting ready to go overseas to adopt . 
oh , how nice . 
we're excited , 
it will be neat . 
i think it will be worth it 
and somebody said to me in terms of , 
this is food so i can say this , 
but you have to bring a formula , 
 they laughed 
food's , food . 
 and  i think that  that would make them drool any way . 
you , know , i guess are you is it a little bit of constricted , because a lot of restaurants don't take , 
in terms of talking about restaurants , i mean a lot of restaurants , how are they when you have children let alone three or four children ? 
you have to be careful if you go to a restaurant that , 
if you're , 
like we could probably take our oldest son and , 
and they know how to act , 
i don't think i would chance it with my younger ones because they're just too much of a distraction 
and some restaurants are really trying to go for that atmosphere kind of thing . 
that yuppie kind of crowd , yeah . 
i've been in some places where they say they take children , 
and then i've just seen where the wait attendance the wait staff is rude , you know . 
and that always just bothered me 
and then , um , on the other hand sometimes the children or the adults are themselves .
i don't know what other kind of restaurants 
really pappasito's we love , um , 
we went to one italian , 
back on the italian , we went to some place across from collin creek mall that absolutely putrid for italian food . 
i can't remember the name of it 
it's on , uh , 
is it tia's , not tia's , um , 
i know which one it is , 
and i can't think of it . 
i can't , 
it's in the strip , yeah , 
and it had white tablecloth , 
i think it was like paper where you could write on them , or something with crayons 
it was just terrible . 
oh dear . 
i mean i was shocked , 
i mean the dish was dirty , um , 
it was one of these you have bad experience and ,
where you felt 
oh dear . 
but other then that i don't know we do our share of pizza eating too , but more like go get it and carry it in cause we're too ,
i don't like strange people coming to my door , um , 
well , i've got selv , 
one of my favorites were 
and i can't really think of any other , um , places . 
except that this makes me fat . 
i'm just kidding . 
you have to watch it if you go out to eat 
that's true . 
that's true , 
but you can always blame it on having children , 
there you go . 
well , i enjoyed talking to you , 
and i guess , you know , 
well , good luck . 
 well , we're just starting a family through adoption 
so i don't really have a lot of , uh , concrete , uh , opinions . 
just what i know out of my peer group , uh , has gone through . 
and none of it has been good .
oh , really ? 
uh , the ones that can afford to have livein nannies ,
uh , but a lot of the other ones that have , are professional , uh , 
i'd say fifty percent of , you know , my peers in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're , you know , going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade . 
uh , but i , 
there must be some good service out there if you 
what age child are you thinking in terms of ? 
in terms of what they're talking about . 
for yourselves .
infant . uh  . . . 
oh , okay . 
 so you're starting from the baseline . 
after eleven years of marriage . yeah , we are . 
actually , it's happening now . 
so , we're just going through the process . 
i see .
so and actually the question is , uh , very appropriate . 
cause i'm not sure uh , how strong the maternal instinct is going to be . 
they tell me it's going to be strong .
do you 
i have one son . 
and did you put him in daycare 
or is he older now or younger 
well , you know , has completed a couple of years of university . 
so he's out of daycare .
and so that , 
but i was working fulltime , uh 
but i was very lucky because i was a college professor . 
and so i was able to , you know , 
and it was 
  flex  .
so i went up there 
and i sort of left him with a neighbor . 
and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little .
and i said , you know , he doesn't need anything except , you know , look at him if he cries . 
but , you know , don't pick him up and 
because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half . 
oh , that's wonderful . 
and i was able to , you know , get , his schedule just , uh , cooperated . 
and  . . . 
that's wonderful . 
um , your , uh , profession . 
i mean , uh , i'm in corporate communications . 
but i've done freelance writing in the past , 
so what we're hoping is that , uh , 
i mean my husband thinks i can do it . 
i've just never worked out of a domestic base , you know . 
i've always 
uh , but i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or parttime 
or if they don't have that , uh , 
my boss , 
i'm very lucky though , again too , my boss is very akin to family building . 
so , i think that's th , something that couples need in going 
uh , i don't know . 
i do think there's good daycare out there . 
what part of the country are you in ? 
i'm in maryland . 
my son was little . 
but the thing is , if you have this flextime and that , you might be able to do something similar to what i did .
that's what i'm hoping . 
and then later on when he was , you know 
 i mean this , 
we're talking about , uh , i went back to work some classes like a week after he was born . 
oh , my goodness . 
you were 
 and so  . . . 
and so that's when i was 
but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house . 
and she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff . 
and then , i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing . 
and , you know , in a sense she carried him around a lot , too much . uh , you know 
uh , he might hurt himself .
 so good objectivity that , that doesn't really , 
that's not a correct english 
but    , you know 
from a mother's standpoint , i mean in a way , objectivity . 
because what he learned to do by the time he was 
and he had asked for a paper and , you know , sort of scribble 
and then he realized that there 
and there were active times . 
and then he also learned that , uh , there were times that you had to be gone , so you probably minimized , 
well uh , we're getting ready . 
i mean , you're far enough away now i can tell you since this is locally , i make sure , we're going to romania in a few weeks . 
and that's , uh ,  just  .
oh , okay . 
as in , like , what twenty twenty and , uh , but we're real excited because we've just developed a contact .
oh , good . 
and it's private 
and it's hospital . 
we're just very excited .
 uh  . . .
 oh great . 
when you deal with issues like that , uh , in terms of family building through adoption , uh , and then you have people responding to you , well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare . 
oh that's silly . 
 uh , issues are being raised prematurely in my mind . 
but i guess they're not because it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later . 
uh , and what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion . 
i feel that if the child is healthy , uh , and as long as we make it feel secure , i'd love to do something like with what you did . 
uh , i don't think i could be dumper where i could take it from , you know , eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there . 
uh , maybe after two or three years old . 
i don't know . um . 
oh ,  , in my opinion , it's even than . 
i mean 
well , they need a schedule i think . 
i don't think the united states , 
what country were you , uh , in europe when you were uh , uh ? 
i was in the middle east . 
uh , that's .
well , that's the same thing . 
i mean i don't know how they are there 
but , uh , in eastern europe , 
my stepfather's from england , 
it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or elder care , as i call it . 
uh , and we're just not set up for that . 
uh ,  with the  .
go ahead . 
i was just going to say , i guess , uh , my sensitivities are much more with the , you know , to be at home . 
because actually , i had 
see , i think that's wonderful . 
and , i mean , that was recently after my son , was going off . 
and i mean , yes , 
in a sense , i went to work 
and she was at home alone some of the time . 
but still , you know , it was much better than being shipped to 
i think too much towards it's somebody 
we cast off . 
i'm that way . 
i want to work . 
shove them in some school for twelve hours a day . 
it's easier 
and i agree with that . 
that's why i 
what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown 
but you can probably empathize with this . 
it's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts .
in terms of what to do . uh , 
and i just don't think there is a good daycare system . 
uh , my company , i'm particularly fortunate that they're in tune with that . 
but i've been at companies where , uh , you know , the trend is , or the definite mood is , well we made conscious decisions not to have children . 
you know . 
and in , 
and a couple like us building through adoption , there , it's almost radical to some people . 
and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out 
and , uh , i respect , there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that you know , they may have the need for child care like that . 
but i agree with you , that it's just , i call it dumping .
i  . . . 
i think that certainly there is a role , uh , for this type of help . 
then , yeah , 
i just , uh , 
and there are tradeoffs too i think . 
one of the things that is a problem is uh , in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers . 
uh , it's just , you know , it's so low 
but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis , it's prohibitive . 
and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year 
actually , there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood . 
mothers who stay home . 
and they take , you know , 
it's probably not completely legal .
uh , i , 
maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids . 
but , and they take care of another child 
and could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this . 
 and they , 
 and i mean that's another possibility 
and , you know , you might want to stay home one year 
and some other lady might want to stay home for a few years 
and  . . . 
i haven't thought about that . 
and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old 
and she's at home parttime paralegal . 
so i'm thinking , um 
and we get along fantastically 
so i'm thinking , you know . 
and that's the way you have to , uh , 
how wa , 
i'm just real curious . 
how was the middle east in terms of that with children ? 
is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them ? 
well , actually there was a daycare center , uh , where my son did go for a year . 
i think from when he was two to three . 
but then he actually started kindergarten at age three . 
and so , and you know , it wasn't like prekindergarten , 
it was real kindergarten . 
oh , really . 
he must be smart . 
so to go to school at that point . 
but , yeah , 
but for the most part , uh , with the extended family , you know , you can usually find somebody . which is much like our neighbor 
who work . 
the professional . 
i was wondering about that . 
uh , there , 
i'm in dallas 
and there was just a very big , uh , series about moslem women 
i'm digressing here 
but , uh , i was just real curious when you said middle east , if you 
and i didn't mean israel . 
so you assumed right .
 oh , no 
that's okay .
 well , even if you did , that's okay actually . 
i think  . . . 
because at first thought , when i'm thinking oh , well she's going to , you know , because certainly in israel the women do work .
they fight , 
they work . 
are you a vietnam veteran , dudley ? .
uh , no . 
do you have family who were in the vietnam war ? 
uh , no . 
so he was too old , 
all right . 
do you know some folks who have been there ? 
uh , yes . 
a couple . 
how did it influence them ? 
uh , the one guy i worked with down in austin hated it . 
uh , he was a lineman down there . 
and while he was there , he caught some kind of a strange disease . 
and , uh , all his hair fell out , 
and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while 
uh , what about long lasting effects on him ? 
has he still suffering from those problems ? 
i do not think he was in combat , 
but , uh , my sister's husband was in vietnam . 
and it really made a completely different man out of him . 
he went to vietnam one man and came back another , not better . 
then , uh , another friend of mine went , 
and he was in combat . 
but he came back , 
much like what roger staubach did . 
uh , he was a vietnam war veteran . 
and , uh , 
but he was in the navy , though ,
that is true . 
it makes a lot of difference . 
and , but , uh , most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land , or in combat , still carry a lot of anger . 
they really do . 
and , uh , i really do not think that we did those young men right . 
i think that , uh , desert storm ,
oh , yeah . 
well , the armed forces did so much to , you know , agent orange , 
they did so much to their own people all during that time . 
that is true . 
you know , and they take a , 
if you come back and your leg is blown off ,
well , you know , one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast asians into this country 
uh , not so ,
but there is just such a surge of southeast asians . 
it has affected the culture of this country , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
it's ab , 
well , uh , the culture is changing . 
look how much more oriental food we have , restaurants now ,
uh , even ten years ago , there were not that many . 
a lot of shops are operated by southeast asians . 
 that's true  .
a lot of people have complained in the schools . 
there is a culture change there . 
the southeast asians seem to be very hungry , 
there seem to be very studious . 
and , uh , tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them , which is not bad . 
not really . 
uh , but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships , for example ,
and that is all a result of vietnam . 
and you see a lot of , 
that is , 
uh , and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there . 
and i would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now . 
well , they are probably not doing very well at all . 
i know that there , 
because i know there is still people even in the dallas area . 
there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from , uh , vietnam . 
native vietnamese people . 
native vietnamese people . 
they were lost , you know , when they were little , 
never did get back 
oh , i had not . 
that had not occurred to me . 
that would be 
they didn't regain any of the land that they had . 
it spilled over into , uh , now i can't even think of the country . 
cambodia ? 
and they were not really fighting , you know , 
it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam . 
but , and i am not even sure who was involved more . whether it was china or russia . 
you know , well , digging tunnels for them .
and there is no way that they could ever catch them . 
well , i think the terrain had a lot to do with the success of desert storm as opposed to that in vietnam . 
that is right . 
you know , there is incredible cover 
and you can't find much cover in a sand 
all they can do is dig in , 
and they ,
that is right . 
and then they try to camouflage the top . 
uhhuh . 
i think even now , and in vietnam they could probably have done a better job . 
because they could kill all those plants , you know , which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on . 
but , and the corps of engineers i think do a better job now , like they did in desert storm . 
he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil 
 and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went . 
and you know , they had to blow them up or , 
and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he had made those moats . 
what world war do you think they found the experience for that ? 
don't you think they learned from the mistakes in vietnam ? 
part of it is that ,
part of it is technology , yeah . 
go ahead . 
and you overcome those problems , 
and you are prepared next time . 
i think that is one of the reasons they have pretty much avoided getting involved in south america . 
and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him ,
he probably just went right down into a tunnel . 
well , i know that , uh , from a personal standpoint , people was one of the finest assets that we lost . 
we did not actually physically lose them . 
they did not lose their lives , 
but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had . 
that is right . 
uh , being entirely different people . 
i had dinner monday night with a vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had . 
that is a long time to suffer . 
and they really need , 
everybody that has stood there , 
when i , 
in vietnam i think it was much closer contact . 
you stand there with a rifle and blow a piece of somebody apart ,
and that has to affect you if you are human , you know . 
oh , yeah , 
so they had to 
i can't , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
you bet , 
i do not , 
you bet . 
but they can reason and , 
well , you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now . 
but that does not undo the ones that were done . 
and that is what makes the veterans angry . 
and i cannot blame them . 
i do not know a solution . 
but i sure cannot blame them for being angry . 
on the other hand , you know , you can be angry about something for a very long time , 
for the most part , i wish that it had not happened . 
but it did . 
and that , 
initially got into it because of eisenhower . 
and than what we started out in august with desert storm . 
oh , yeah . 
and then it just blew up into the war . 
well , it has been that way for a very , very long time , though . 
i can remember when i was in the sixth grade , 
and that was many years ago . 
we were reading about the french 
french , yeah . 
so , and the asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on . 
right , yeah . 
there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world . 
i do not know , 
we should not have maybe gotten involved . 
but if we did , we certainly should have supported our people who were there . 
more so supported them when they got home . 
and , uh , i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part . 
and i saw the movie ,
and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times . 
more than , what was , apocalypse now .
i think so . 
well , i think so . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
do you have a personal computer ? 
i work with them quite a bit though . 
i work with them at kelly services , doing , uh , data entry . 
oh , okay . 
what do you think about them ? 
well , i think they're useful , 
i think they're over used , 
well , that's not the right way to say it . 
you mean instead of people 
like every body has their own p c 
and it really , 
without them knowing how to use it properly , it slows them down , more than it helps them accomplish something . 
they spend more time messing with the p c than they would actually accomplishing the tasks that they're trying to do if they didn't have a p c at all . 
and you really have to be able to type pretty fast you know , before it really saves time . 
that's true . 
and you have to , you know , be familiar with it , 
like there're so many different software packages , you have to be familiar with the one that you're going to be using most . 
a lot of times , uh , people know about half of the capabilities of a package that they should know to actually be able to use it properly , 
and so they waste more time with their trying to , uh , figure out how to do , you know , other things , than they would if they actually understood what they were trying to do . 
you know , like , uh , they want to format a report a certain way 
 and if they really understood the capabilities of the package they could do that in about , you know , half the time that they spend trying to figure out how to do it without spending the time to learn the package properly . 
to set up the boundaries correctly , and 
a lot of times they do it manually on the computer , which just really is a waste of time , 
and then , if they ever have to change anything in the document , they have to go back and redo it all manually , whereas if they had learned the package properly to start with and had set it up correctly , the package would do that for them 
can't you put , 
so i've seen that as a problem . 
but they set up a certain document , 
and it may be eight pages long . 
and they set it up manually , so that they have all their spacings and formattings and tabs set manually . 
and , um , 
rewrite the whole thing . 
if they had set up the formatting on the system itself , it would do that for them , and save them a lot of time . 
but a lot of people don't spend the time to learn the package . 
how does the word wrap work on that ? 
do you end up with very different length lines ? 
oh , no , 
you can left and right justify the whole thing . 
it comes out just perfectly spaced like a block . 
it'll automatically , 
it's like typesetting . 
it'll automatically do that for you . 
and it divides the words by itself ? 
oh , okay . 
they usually have it space the words in a rather than divide a word . 
so , you see , like in a newspaper , they typeset . 
they don't usually break words in a newspaper . 
if one line is going to be a lot shorter than another line , they just add spaces to that line to make it look long as the rest of the lines . 
they space it out in the line itself . 
and most computers do that . 
most software packages will do that for you . 
for five years , you know , 
and i would say , well , you know , you know more about this package than i do , 
how do you left justify ? 
and it would take me maybe two or three minutes looking in the manual to figure out what command it was that caused this to happen . 
so obviously they'd never considered looking it up , you know . 
do you think it's a lack of training , 
or it's just that they don't use the materials that are available to them . 
sometimes it's , 
well , it's a number of different things . 
sometimes uh , they don't think that they can get any information out of the manual . 
some manuals aren't really designed very well . 
but some of them ,
and more and more of them are coming out written in a way that just a basic , general user can understand them . 
so , i think , um , people think it's going to take them a lot longer to learn it properly than it really would , 
and so they're really wasting time rather than saving themselves time , because they think , well , it's quicker just to do it myself 
it's better to learn it directly from the manual . 
well , i think so . 
especially when you have to trouble shoot some things . 
 program still has , uh , bugs in it , 
and you have to work around it . 
have you worked mostly on i b m , 
that is you know , the industry standard . 
there's a lot of really good i b m compatibles , too . 
they don't have to necessarily be the i b m brand , 
but they have to adhere to that industry standard . 
oh , okay . 
well it was nice talking to you . 
thank you . 
are you a t i er ? 
no . 
is somebody in your family a t i er ? 
and that's how he got it . 
oh , okay , 
so who do you work for ? 
i just graduated from college . 
so you don't have any benefits at all to talk about . 
 or , what i'm looking for . 
oh , okay , 
well in interviewing have you ever discussed benefits with some of the potential employers ? 
didn't get that far . 
you normally just try to sell them on your , uh , aptitude and not , you know , well how much vacation do i get .
 well i'll tell you a little bit about what t i has as benefits . 
we do have , uh , 
like most companies , we have medical insurance . 
although they're tending to try to really cut costs more and more . um , what they started with a few years ago is that they only would allow you to go to , um , set hospitals in the area . 
they call it network hospitals . 
they're hos , 
 oh , yeah , 
i've heard of that . 
they're hospitals that they're , uh , agreeing with , uh , t i that they'll be a certain rate , you know , for rooms and care and all that kind of stuff to keep you know , costs down . 
now they're going to start to do the same kind of thing with doctors . 
so it's almost like um , uh , an h m o 
if you go to a doctor who isn't in the network then it will be less benefits that you get . 
we have some dental coverage now , um , 
but you have to pay a little more to really get something worthwhile . 
like , i've had a couple of crowns recently 
and if you didn't have the extra dental plus , um , you only get like a third of your cost , which can be kind of expensive with a crown . 
 it can  .
 so , i pay , 
i pay for the extra dental plus , so much more per month because it always seems like if you're going to have a crown or something major done it pays a little more . 
um , we do have pension , although i've realized recently that the pension doesn't seem to be too good 
and i know when you first start out working you're not thinking about that .
oh , i like to think about that . 
i don't think's it's going to pay too long when i get out . 
um , we do have a new thing that they've started a few years ago , um , 
it's not an i r a , 
it's called a four oh one k plan . 
it's kind of like pension . 
you put in so much money 
and then , t i , um , meets you half way up to a certain maximum . 
so like i put in a dollar , they put in fifty cents . 
so , that grows pretty good 
and i think that will be more of something i can see of a pension than the regular pension plan . 
of course you can buy stock in the company , 
but , you know , that's not always a real , for sure kind of thing . 
not always safe .
especially with this one , you know , it kind of goes up and down . 
i don't know if it's any different than other companies , 
but you hate to have it fluctuate 
and like , you know , last year it was forty dollars a share 
and now this year it's thirty six dollars a share , 
and you go , gee , i'm losing money .
doesn't quite feel as good . 
and we ge , you know , vacation normally after you're here for six months 
and you start to get like five days every six months is kind of how they accrue it to you . 
and it's , one nice thing about t i is after you've been here , uh , for five years ,
oh , that's nice . 
which , a lot of places make you work like ten years or so ,
and we get , uh , decent holidays . 
um , at thanksgiving we always get the two days off which is nice , to make a nice long weekend . 
and at christmas we always get two days at christmas . 
they float it around depending on which day of the week christmas falls on . 
so that's nice , so you always get two days at christmas . 
a lot of people just take , you know , that week , 
i normally take that week somehow , you know . 
you only have to take three days of vacation 
and you get the whole week at christmas time . 
well , um , i can just tell you like , you know , 
 well there's twelve kids in my family . 
whoa , okay! 
so the dental was very important , you know , to my dad . 
but , um , i think they took the dental away now . 
he worked for united telephone system , 
you know , 
 and they took the dental away , 
but now i think they're going to start getting into eye . 
oh , yeah . 
i think , uh , um , 
i don't use the services 
but yeah , i think sometime last year , or just recently they started to give some kind of eye coverage . 
you get discounts on , uh , glasses 
and i'm not quite sure , there's certain places you can go to that have , uh , discounts for people that work here . 
so you can get glasses and contacts and stuff through those particular stores or something like that . 
and now for his pension he pretty much just has the stock . 
like if he puts in a dollar they'll put in a dollar , you know . 
 and then he's only allowed , i think , i don't know if it's maybe five percent , or something like that that he's allowed to put in 
and they'll match it . 
so and , um , he works for the , 
did you ever hear of the national bureau of standards ? 
well he works for them . 
they changed their name now 
but that's where he works 
and , um , his vacation is really nice . 
he's going to be there three years at the end of this month 
and he'll be getting three weeks vacation . 
that's pretty decent . 
you know , of course , it's for the government 
and he has all the holidays off . 
and you get some extra ones . 
federal workers always seem to get , 
you know , you get columbus day , and veterans day ,
he has it really nice . 
it's nice where he works , 
and , um , he seems to be very happy , you know . 
like his hospitalization 
and , you know , he has all that 
and with his doctors and stuff , they have , um , a list of doctors that the employees can go to 
and it only costs a dollar as long as they go to that doctor . 
 oh , yeah , 
 you know , and i think it works the same way with his prescriptions and stuff if he needs any . 
but you have to go , you know , to certain ones 
but still that works out really nice . 
you know , it , 
we're doing an h m o right now , um , 
and when we go to get prescriptions it's five dollars , 
that's not bad either . 
like my husband always takes   which is kind of like , you know , contact stuff , only better . 
um , you 
that's like a buck a capsule . 
so if you've got thirty in there it normally comes out to about thirtyfour dollars so when you pay five it's a pretty good savings . 
then there's other times that , you know , maybe the prescription wouldn't cost more than like seven or eight dollars 
and you pay five anyhow . 
so it isn't a , 
you want to start first  ? 
of course . 
you apparently have somebody there , in one . 
and her mother , 
oh , you are kidding ? 
and then my mother also owned and operated a nursing home ,
i will be darned . 
and , uh , my mother and my older sister both are geriatric nurses . 
oh , for heaven's sake . 
so , i do know something about that . 
you are very , very much aware of what goes on . 
that is great . 
actually , the motivation for grandmother entering the business ,
she was lonely . 
and she needed company ,
and so she opened a nursing home and initially started with eight ladies . 
i will be darned . 
and then , uh , it grew into a ,
uh , then they , 
now , see that is a nice attitude to go into . 
uh , it seems like they must be waiting until it is a necessity 
 and there is no chance of , uh , good companionship or doing anything . 
well , that is not really true , either , uh , 
i think that is a stigma and an i , 
you see , those who had bad experiences talk about them . 
uh , right , 
and those who do not may write ,
but they do not talk a whole lot about that . 
that is true . 
but what i mean is instead of maybe entering a nursing home ,
well now ,
well , that is because they wait until the children make those choices ,
however , my daughterinlaw also is a nurse in a nursing home . 
and , uh , she works for one here in dallas , which is more a retirement village than it is a nursing home . 
and these , 
uh , uhhuh . 
and , uh , would you , you know , call down and have the van come around and take ,
and they are very active and very enthusiastic 
and they have ,
their dining room looks like , you know , luby's cafeteria . 
that is great . 
or one of the lovely cafeterias . 
and they have , you know , pink linen napkins for their dinners .
that sounds great . 
oh , i am certainly very much for a nursing home 
and i think when the parent gets old enough ,
it is expensive . 
it is costly . 
see if they could get this idea across though , better than what it is ,
well , now my daddy's mother , uh , lived in a retirement village 
and she and her sister had side by side duplexes ,
she still had her individuality , 
but they were there close 
and they did have , uh , you know , the button that you could push the central office if you got into problems 
and they   have security . 
i am very much in favor , 
i have heard horror stories , 
oh , well you have that with anything . 
i know that the elderly can easily be abused , 
oh  yeah  .
but i would be willing to bet they are far less abused in a nursing home than they are in ,
in the homes , yeah . 
like when my sister was real bad before she died 
and they were super with her . 
they were , uh , 
well now , my grandmother , 
of course all of my folks lived to be very old 
 and my grandmother developed hodgkin's disease ,
she went to the doctor , 
she had surgery , 
she got the treatments 
and during ,
she got better , 
she got well , 
she got out and went dancing again . 
well , a lot of people do that . 
 they   ,
that is right . 
i think it is a wonderful interim place , 
it is a place that you do not have to struggle with hospital ,
and yet it is not , you know , 
you have , 
and it can become home to them . 
it certainly is . 
it certainly does , 
but , you see , we have had excellent experience with that . 
and , uh , i did not put my husband in a nursing home when he became ill , 
i might , 
this is   
but , i would like , 
there has to be consideration taken on everything . 
that is right . 
and i think you would shop for a nursing home , just like you would shop for a church ,
that is right , 
you would look into it thoroughly and ,
when you get to the point where you are in trouble ,
and you do not have the time to look , 
that is what ,
that is right . 
most people will not even look at that until it becomes a necessity . 
i think that one of the best ways to do that is for families to realize they are going to be needing those facilities one day ,
go out to the nursing home , help guide some craft programs , perhaps , work on some music programs , whatever their talents are . 
whatever their talents , yeah . 
i have a cousin who is , uh , 
she had a son that was epileptic from birth , 
and he did fine ,
they lived on a farm , 
but she made arrangements , so that when she was gone ,
that is right . 
so she was gone , that he would go into the nursing home . 
and i would say , he adjusted very well 
and , uh , he has been there quite a long time . 
and , uh , he don't know me usually .
so , he goes wheeling down , uh , the hall to bingo . 
somebody else ,  is helping  him out ,
that is right . 
and , uh , he has adjusted very well . 
oh yes . 
routine and ,
uh , the only real problem with that in a nursing home is that the staff turns over . 
i do not think they pay ,
to keep them there , uhhuh . 
and that is sad , because , i think the health profession is one of the most critical , 
but    ,
and , uh , 
that is right . 
it seems to be a resistance . 
care for the elderly and care for the children ,
 but there seems to be a resistance . 
you are preserving your heritage and your future there . 
so , uh , 
and , as a matter of fact , i do not see why they do not have children's programs in nursing homes . 
well , around here , we have some , you know , the churches ,
the children thoroughly enjoy , 
my name is karen . 
my name is terry . 
and this , uh , 
i've probably personally take i think just two 
 but that's because my motherinlaw takes every one they print and gives them to me ,
so i get all of them . 
uh , the one that i really especially enjoy , 
and you may be familiar with it from wisconsin , is called country . 
oh , yes , uh , 
there's country living , 
there's country , 
and , uh , 
well , this , 
this one is the one they have all the pictures of scenery from places we wished we live , like 
oh , yeah . 
gorgeous leaves and trees and all the lakes and the mountains and things . 
and i get that , it has recipes in it , 
and that's my very favorite . 
oh , that's great . 
what do you take ? 
well , i actually take country living , 
it's a 
in fact , uh , right before you called , i was planning my tulips 
are you ? 
but , uh , so , i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into , um , housing type things , be 
and decorating and how to do things . 
so i'm pretty much in the same category as what 
well , we tried for a while to take a news magazine . 
we took newsweek 
 and i think we took it especially just during the war to kind of catch up on everything and 
but we've kind of discontinued that right now 
 and we're going to start taking that , uh , u s news , uh , newspaper . u s a today , 
i think it . 
i've had time before . 
i think with that what happens 
 but you kind of just put the magazine away 
and you never read it again 
that's right . 
that's exactly right . 
i did the same thing . 
we saved the ones from the election 
and we saved the ones from the war and one from the earthquake . 
 and then 
we just saved everything we could 
but , uh 
but i find that with these country magazines , i keep going back to them , getting ideas , looking back and saying , jeez , there was a flower garden in there that i    , 
well , you sound like you ,
i get a lot of ideas from them . 
we do . 
we're out in the country 
we're right across from a river , 
and uh , you're right , the leaves are beautiful , 
and they are falling now , 
uh , it just peaked , uh , last week , 
and it was just gorgeous out here , 
i bet it is gorgeous . 
it's beautiful . 
the other thing about magazines , the only thing i don't like , is they really get heavily into advertising 
i agree , 
i'd rather almost have 
i know that part , probably half their money comes from these people that are saying , uh , put my ad in your paper 
but , uh , there's been some magazines i've looked at , 
and it's a real turn off to see every 
every page . 
i do the same thing , 
i think i opened vogue the other day or something 
vogue is ,
 and it was just nothing , uhhuh . 
it's almost 
you know , what's the point ? 
 i mean , you could go into a store and get bombarded 
that's right . 
and my number one pet peeve in a magazine , is when they put the perfume in it 
 and very often , like , you know , in my bills , also , magazines and bills , and they'll ,
they're really getting into that 
but pretty much like i said , the magazines i've had , better homes and garden , 
and now i need a switch , 
and i'm going back to gourmet cooking , because , um , i've had 
and i thought , well , i'll give it a try again , because you get tired of one magazine , 
and you need to try a 
i understand . 
well , do you tear out of your magazines , your recipes 
uh , yes , 
and most of the time 
a lot of times , uh , you know , if i got a chance to sit down at my typewriter , i'll go ahead and type out recipes , 
type it out , uhhuh . 
see how the family liked it .
and then if we like it it becomes part of the recipe collection , 
but , uh . 
oh , that's a good idea . 
well , i'm going to pay attention more when i'm in the store to that country living , i remember 
back when i decorated the house with a lot of the little country , uh , primitive things , and the 
and i bought a lot of the country magazines 
 and then it seems like when i put some of that away , i quit buying it , 
but i had forgotten the recipes 
 and i'm going to , 
i just went through , uh 
we just recently moved from minnesota to wisconsin . 
i went through all this , 
i had this huge stack of house beautiful 
i had colonial times , 
i had gourmet 
and you don't want to part with any of them because there's 
it was hard , 
but i ended up , uh , reducing them down to like fifteen magazines out of , uh 
oh , that's good . 
it really doesn't , you know 
it's got to have more than that 
it's got to have some good ideas 
it's got to have everything . 
so i just kind of went through , 
and i find that most of the magazines i really like is around christmas time because , 
i know , 
basically i can tell you that i like just about every music there is except for , uh , uh , real hard , hard rock , 
i really can't get into that 
so i pretty much have a wide range of , uh , what i like , 
 so that's about it . 
i can even take the   
now , it's pretty neat music 
i'm pretty much the same way , 
but there's like certain types of country western i can't handle 
the old , old stuff that came out , i think it was , was it , oh , jeez , came out with some of that , hank williams , 
oh , yeah , 
the old , old country , 
but other than that , i like pretty much everything . 
that's the way i am , too , 
so , other than , uh , 
as far as instruments , i can go from piano to the saxophone . 
lately , you know , with the new music that has come out , some of the really good , uh , music 
and it's so funny , because you can take an instrument and forget what it really sounds like when it plays by itself . 
 oops , are you okay , tiana , come here honey . 
 oh , my daughter just fell . 
do you like kenny g ? 
uh , yeah , 
i can pretty much , 
oh , it's all wet , tiana . 
i just uh , did the floor , 
and she slipped . 
anyway , but , uh , um , yeah , 
i can take all kinds of music pretty much 
the heavy metal , 
i have no interest in that , 
i don't have interest of losing my ears , 
let's just put it that way ,
i saw peter townsend on t v last night , 
and he said he's lost most of his hearing 
well it was good talking to you then . 
well , same here . 
you all have a good day . 
you , too . 
scott , let's , uh , talk about advice that we can offer a parent where the child is going to go to a university 
do you have any ? 
do you have any kids 
i have yes , some children . 
i have three boys . 
and they're all quite young 
 and so we want to plan for their education 
or we're saving right now 
and we're getting bonds , uh , and hopefully finances set aside so that they can choose a college that they want to . 
how about yourself ? 
do you have any kids ? 
 so i imagine you've gone through the experience yourself of selecting 
in fact , i'm for my p h d . 
it's a close subject right now .
very good . 
uh , what do you use as a basis to determine which college or university you go to ? 
well  , uh , uh , uh , i have used , uh , several techniques depending on what , 
for undergraduate , 
uh , when i wanted to go to an undergraduate institution , i was looking for something that was , you know , rather small and easy to get around , you know . 
what you thought , huh . 
uh , you know , it changed a whole lot . 
you know , with a name behind me , rather than , uh 
just the degree itself . 
well , that's good , because i did quite a bit the same thing in my undergraduate work . 
i wanted to get a school that was small enough , that was personable 
 and , uh , but i felt that i got a pretty good , uh , undergraduate , uh , 
where did you go ? 
i went to utah state university 
 and the nice thing about it too is , i knew that i wanted to get into business and that their college of business , was accredited 
and well known 
and so you also need to see what kind of name the , 
like you mentioned before , the name the college and university can give you 
i wanted to make sure that i would be able to afford it , that i wouldn't get through and have to leave . 
and , uh , so i did a lot of talking with friends , with family 
and , uh , it was kind of unusual because three different universities , depending on what our choice was . 
hopefully we chose the one that was best for us , 
and i felt very comfortable and good about that . 
do you worry any about , uh , uh , being able , 
i mean , obviously you've taken precautions , you know , or measures to , uh , try and pay for your children's education , 
but do you think that that's going to be enough ? 
no . 
i don't know . 
the way that tuition is increasing , um , exponentially 
i , uh , 
all i can hope for is that i land a professorship at a nice heavy university . 
 and that your children can use the benefits of 
well , that's an excellent idea , 
one thing uh , that we did , uh , and my parents , and our family , is that we weren't able to afford , um , the kind of education that we all desired . 
so my parents stressed that we get excellent grades so that we apply and try for scholarships 
 and , uh , scholarships were very beneficial in my case to help pay for my education , because my parents couldn't . 
and what the scholarship could not supply i was able 
also , he's a medical doctor right now . 
he had to , you know , 
once he got past his undergraduate and graduate degree , he had to take out some loans , 
and he's working to pay those off . 
so uh , you know , once you get past , uh , the initial stages of it , that there's different options you can use 
and , uh 
that's my biggest option right now . 
and as you're well aware that tuition's not , 
so , what do you think about a year or two of public service ? 
well , i know it's hard for young people to think about giving up their carefree years 
 but people that i have known that have done that , like from other countries , especially ,
and i think they're better people 
they're much more responsible . 
i know , um , the church that i go to , um , the young men give two years of their life when they turn nineteen , you know , 
they're encouraged to do that , missionary work , 
and i really believe that the people that do that are better people that make our ,
you know , i , 
um , was a basically an education major when i graduated from college 
and i accepted a job that at the time was just slightly above the poverty level to teach to , um , very rural children in a very low income district 
and i spent a year teaching there 
 and i think it was probably one of my largest eyeopening experiences because i come from nice middle class white suburban home 
 and i did it , um , for one reason i wanted , 
i was working on a masters degree 
so i wanted to stay close to where i was working on a masters degree , but also because i just thought that it would be interesting to live some place else so totally different than my own up bringing 
 and i , 
it probably changed my political views 
it changed my understanding of the world around me 
 and i think , um , in fact , if i had to do it all again i , you know , 
after that , you know , you never think of it i guess because i paid for all of my college education myself , i never thought about doing that because i had all these college loans i'd started paying back . 
um , beca , so that was one reason why i never considered it 
but now that i'm further along , and i'm still paying these college loans ,
um , i had them delayed because i'm back in graduate school and on that form it says if your joining the peace corps you can have them delayed 
 and i thought that was , you know , very interesting 
and i would have thought of that earlier 
i probably would have done , you know , just like , is that the mormon church ,
because one of my neighbors , uh , did that in pittsburgh , from pittsburgh . 
and i thought , you know , that really , 
now that i'm thirty years old , i think that one or two years out of my life would have , 
probably like you said , to be able to travel some place else whether it be the united states or outside the country ,
well , i think so , 
it puts you out on your own 
i mean , teenagers in our country are kind of a year that parents don't look forward to and , 
and i think that it would help people to become ,
and i think , you know , we have such a need now , you know , 
i taught , you know , 
i think i was paid , uh , about nine thousand dollars to teach for the year 
 and i worked in a very rural school district 
and one of the things i taught was a computer class 
 and these kids , um , you know , every girl i taught , except for one , was pregnant . 
oh , no . 
many of the boys in the room had children 
and they were high school juniors . 
and i just , 
there , you know , they came from poverty , 
they were going to condition in poverty 
and it was , the school district couldn't hire many people , 
it was very difficult for them to hire , 
and i think , you know , in the sense , that aspect of public service for education in some of the inner cities 
see , i never , 
i tell you sometimes i worry about things over seas because we have such problems right here in our own country . 
it would really , um , 
and i don't 
the people that i've known like from germany and finland that have done that 
but still they have benefited from it . 
and , um , you know , although i wouldn't want it   to make people to go off to the military voluntarily 
and they are just a lot more mature ,
and  , 
i think it would also help them if they then went on to college . 
i know that my first couple of years of college were , um , uh , probably too carefree at the ,
and then at the end i had to be too serious . 
well , that's right . 
a lot of people they flunk out 
or they get , 
that's true . 
that's right . 
uh , you know , 
because we love our freedom 
that's true . 
but , you know , our , 
like in our church , it is , your free to do that or not 
you're encouraged to do it because , um , you know , it helps you , 
and , of course , we think it's helping other people . 
oh , i think it is . 
 and so , 
i really think , 
i think , um , people , 
you should , 
i , you know , 
the kids today i teach , 
i spend a lot of my time teaching college students 
 and , um , i find great disgust in them , um , their selfcenteredness 
 and i really , you know , 
they don't understand , uh , how other people live , um , 
and they're preoccupied with ,
i think that's , uh , just having a good time . 
and  , 
i , uh , 
a friend of mine is a psychologist 
and he always refers to it as shortterm pleasure oriented . 
i guess he's a technical aspect he likes to apply to it ,
today's young people are shortterm pleasure oriented , 
that's true . 
 and everything has to be an immediate reward 
and it has to be fun . 
that's really true . 
well , i don't know how that would ever happen here 
but at least , um , 
well , they say , 
i think i , um , have read recently that , uh , the bush administration has increased the funding for the peace corps . 
oh , really . 
because i guess because of the changes in eastern europe , uh , they've increased funding for the peace corps . 
i guess it's some of the peace dividend in the sense , you known , 
when they're decreasing some of the military spending ,
and some of the are the overseas programs . uh , 
well , i have seen a big change , i think , in high school kids that my relatives  ,
and at least i had some interest in , 
a lot of the youth that i come in contact with they say oh , i want to be a doctor , i want to be a lawyer . 
because they make a lot of money . 
that's true . 
and they don't have a goal , 
they don't have an interest in their own field of study . 
they're just looking what's going to pay the biggest cash . 
that's very true . 
you know , how many , 
is it they say we have so many lawyers in this country , 
and i guess , in baltimore , it's something like one in four people ,
and i just sort of think that's ridiculous . 
there's just too many people . 
that's right . 
not enough people want to do that to , 
you know , if you want to be a lawyer because you know that you can provide a service that people need 
you saw ,
that's true . 
that's kind of sad . 
well , anyway . 
that's interesting . uhhuh . 
well , i guess i better go . 
thanks so much for the conversation . 
well , good luck to you . 
i enjoyed it . 
well , thank you very much . 
uh , let's see , 
so , uh , were we right in the middle east ? 
should we have been there ? 
did we do what was correct there ? 
i think we should have stayed longer . 
should we have fought them harder ? 
used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used ? 
but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do . 
oh , you agree with schwartzkopf who says , uh , drive on into baghdad . 
i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now . 
and it's almost like they're killing each other off 
and there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all .
would that be so bad ? 
was there anything there to begin with ? 
well , i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it , um . 
it wasn't ours . 
well , no , 
i just mean that , the world in general .
we've got to talk so it's just as well we argue . 
um , i don't know , 
i think we should have helped the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more ,
i agree . 
wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country . 
but i think that's almost impossible , next to impossible . 
i heard excuse me , president bush say that he , uh , wanted to improve the highways . 
oh , see , i haven't really been keeping up with them 
so i really don't know what he said . 
what did he say about it ? 
oh , he wanted to take the current secondary highway system 
we don't have the money for that . 
but wouldn't it be wonderful . 
oh , okay , um , 
see , out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fiftyfive 
we drive sixtyfive . 
oh , really . 
oh , yes . 
well , i , uh , last weekend , went home to visit my parents . 
my dad's in the hospital . 
and , uh , between here and west texas , there was probably three and four hours at sixtyfive miles an hour . 
oh , i didn't realize that . 
have you ever been out here ? 
how far west have you been ? 
only in ohio . 
oh , you've never ,
i've never been past ohio . 
i never seen the great , 
i've seen , 
the rocky mountains ? 
i've seen pictures of it 
yellowstone ? 
i've seen pictures , 
and , um , i'm paying for my own education 
and i come from a large family 
and there's twelve kids in the family . 
well , my college educa , uh , thirtysix , 
worked for texas instruments for seventeen or eighteen now . 
oh , my . 
uh , know , virtually nothing else . 
uh , yeah . 
i got my four year , 
it's a funny degree .
anyway , uh , i know nothing other than the west . 
in fact , uh , down in east texas 
and it's really interesting . 
so tell me about where you live . 
well , um , i'm originally from butler 
and that's about an hour away from where i am now . 
i'm at clairon . 
and , um , it's pretty , like , windy and hilly . 
uh , how high is the highest elevation ? 
oh , i couldn't even tell you . 
like , uh , probably 
it's not like a mountain . 
it wouldn't be like a mountain . 
it's , uh , 
three thousand feet ? 
oh , i don't even know . 
i have no clue . 
close to sea level ? 
uh , right here in colorado springs where i live 
 um , yes 
when i lived in texas , every year i had to drive , you know . 
i drove every year to the gulf 
and , you know , so i could have a feast of fresh seafood 
i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america . 
how many hours have you been from home ? 
uh , the farthest away from home ? 
probab , i'd say five or six . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas , 
look at your map later and see the town of amarillo 
to just go buy a pair of jeans , we'd drive an hour . 
oh , my .
oh , my gosh . 
when i was growing up ,
and people buy jeans in town , 
but uh , we thought nothing at all of waking up in the morning hopping into your car , grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours . 
oh , yes . 
now see for me , that's a long ways . 
it is i imagine . 
even , well , like , i'm in like a little town right now . 
it's smaller than butler 
and , um , butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh . 
so that will give you some idea of where i'm at . 
and i'm about , 
how neat . 
and , uh , i mean just this little town here is basically a college town . 
without the college here , this town would be nothing . 
it would be absolutely dead . 
because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants 
and in the summer when we co , uh , 
we come up here in the summer , 
and it's , 
i mean , there's just no one around . 
so are you working your way through college ? 
um , well , i go home in the summer 
and i work in the summer 
and between what i make in the summer and student loans , that's how i go to college . 
well , how neat . 
what's your major ? 
finance . 
well , that's interesting . 
so , uh , what do you plan to do with it ? 
um , well , like i said my fianc3ee , *[[typo
savings and loans , uh , 
and i'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or something . 
i'd rather work for a company and , um , like be their financial advisor or something . 
oh , that would be great . 
that would be neat .
let's see , uh , so we're all excited in colorado springs . 
apple computer is coming to town . 
oh , really . 
the , uh , new employer is in the city . 
so we're expecting our local economy to  ,
take a boom a little bit . 
well , well what would be the unemployment rate out there ? 
uh , unemployment runs approximately six percent . 
see that's what it is here too . 
but , now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent . 
and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree . 
it's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs . 
it is . 
i know people they are out of school for two or three years 
and they have a job that has nothing to do  . . . 
uh , i have five children all together . 
oh , uhhuh . 
uh , my oldest two are already out and about in the world 
and i , uh , have a set of twins that are fourteen 
 and , uh , my youngest is twelve . 
that's great . 
i always thought it'd be great to have twins . 
uh , yeah . 
if you like doing everything twice .
well , yeah 
uh , at any rate , um , my first two children , uh , i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them . 
um , and , you know , was uh , a fulltime job that ,
and , uh , so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i should have , as i really wanted to . 
your first ones you mean , it ,
the f , 
well , it was with all of them , 
but it was , uh , more an impact , i think , on the oldest two . 
because , um , when the twins were about three years old . 
and , uh , you know , i don't think they noticed i wasn't around that much . 
you know , with all the children around the house , it's ,
 so , what i've tried to do , uh , now that i've , uh , 
went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old . 
and , uh , so , then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fiftyone hours ,
so , i've tried to spend more time with , uh , the children since then . 
um , what i'm currently doing is , uh , taking a lot of time . 
i'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings . 
um , we just started a thing where every other week we go to , uh , movies . 
there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on wednesday nights . 
and so , every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the ,
and , it's working out pretty well . 
um , we're spending more time together . 
i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before . 
um , in fact , i found that i'm a lot closer with , uh , 
i have one son who's gone 
and i don't even know where he's at . 
um , he's taken off for parts unknown , 
that's difficult . 
but , uh , yeah . 
and , uh , my daughter um , has moved out of the house . 
her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved .
and uh , so it's been difficult to try to find the time , 
and i think it's important that we do , because , uh , i notice that , uh , when i had spent two years down in dallas , down there they all have uh , a me kind of attitude . 
and i noticed parents not spending time with their ,
and , you know , i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine 
um , uhhuh . 
i saw the family falling apart down ,
texas is ,
i mean , it was bad enough every place else , 
but drugs in texas , are extremely bad . 
and so , i think it's kind of important that i , you know , nurture the relationship i have with my children now . 
and i'm doing my best 
well , that's all you can do . 
what's been your experience ? 
well , i was going to ask , too , does your wife work ? 
she just recently started working then . 
uh , she worked a job until we moved to our new house 
and , uh , she quit that job because it was too inconvenient . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , that sounds great . 
we also have five children . 
and , but ours are all out of the nest .
so , uh , like you had , you know , having the time . 
when you have younger ones to take care of , you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones . 
but , uh , we're very active , of course , at church , and , uh , boy scouting , and girl scouts , four h , uh , 
and those activities helped a lot in ,
and uh , we try to take a vacation with them every year , camping of some sort , something that wasn't expensive . 
and , uh , our youngest is , uh , expecting her first baby . 
so , they're all out and on their own . 
and we have one to get married yet .
and they'll all be married . 
uh , and they're all doing pretty good . 
they , uh , 
 t  lives in pittsburgh , you probably don't know where that is . 
two of our children live there . 
uh , one , in around maryland , d c . 
he works right on the border of d c . 
and one lives in connecticut 
and our baby lives just a mile over the hill  ,
that sounds great . 
i've noticed , uh , another thing , um , when i was younger my father was always working . 
and , uh , you know , uh , he worked a fulltime job and a parttime job , 
and i never saw him . 
so , i didn't have much of a role model to go by .
to go , to follow . 
and that does make a big difference . 
and it , 
if you don't have , 
i don't , 
it's my feeling that if you don't have a role model to follow 
you know , everybody's not father knows best . 
well none of us are . 
let's face it ,
i mean , 
and , uh , 
now , our daughter , other one that has children . 
she has two boys . 
and , she works full time 
and i have mixed feelings about that . 
she's able to do that 
and i don't know if she'd be happy to stay at home . 
but , yet , on the other hand , i've got the mixed feelings that i think you should be at home with your children . 
i'm kind of old fashioned , i guess , that way . 
but they seem to give , uh , quality time to those children when they are together . 
it seems for them that it works out all right . 
so , i don't know . 
i don't think i ever would have had what it would take to work full time and raise a family . 
it's not easy . 
uh , you know , i've helped out extremely , uh , 
well , i can't say that , 
but i've helped out  ,
and , uh , as you know , with five children it takes a lot of work . 
it does ,
what line of work are you in now since you went to school 
uh , well , now i work for texas instruments . 
a lot of the people i've talked to work for , uh , for the same . 
and so , i've , uh , 
prior to that uh , i worked in a food store . 
and , uh , you know , wor , 
which your income would be a lot better ,
a smart move to make . 
and , uh , 
and it's ,
i mean , 
and , uh , you know , every time something new came up , i was explaining it to them . 
and you , 
i , uh , 
i , uh , started back to school . 
in fact , i was going to school while i was working fiftyone hours a week 
and that's why i , 
you know 
well , it puts a strain on everybody , your wife and your family . 
and , the only thing you can remember is to try and stay together as much as you can ,
well , it all paid off . 
well , that's wonderful . 
so , uh , you know , i got my degree and got the better paying job , 
it sounds to me like , uh , you're doing well . 
my husband's retired , 
so , uh , he's been retired for three years now . 
that's quite a change . 
well , my goal is to try to retire by the time i'm fiftyfive . 
oh , well , he made it at fifty .
it was a magic number for him 
and , uh , he went at fifty , 
and he still works part time at other thing , you know , same job as he was doing , only he's retired and doing it independently . 
but , uh , nevertheless retired . 
well , i'm .
well , basically , uh , did you want to go first , then ? 
uh , well , i can . 
i don't own my home . 
uh , i mean i live in a nice area 
and i rent my home 
i think as far as , like , our home , it's , uh , in a small residential area . 
we're out of the cities quite a ways , 
so it's kind of more of a country setting 
and , uh , it's just a typical , uh , three bedroom type of home . 
it's nothing , you know , elaborate where it has , uh , this or this or , you know . 
uh , and i think as far as if it's , for put it into standards of , uh , what other homes are around here , it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are . 
uh , there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes 
and yet there's , 
where we can view the river from that distance , there's still homes within our area that are , you know , pretty typical of what our home is , 
and he lives in korea . 
oh , really ? 
and , uh , he's recently moved here 
and he's owns eight or nine properties 
 and , uh , so , 
oh , yeah , 
and they're not very expensive either . 
it just seems like , 
we have a three bedroom house . 
ours is one level only . 
uh , but we , 
so it's the rambler style . 
it's kind of like what ours is . 
uh , one of our bedrooms is really small 
and we've made that into a den because we only have one child , 
so that was our best way of going with , uh , the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller . 
it seems like they get incredibly small .
uh , but , uh , anyway , but , okay . 
so that sounds great , 
uh , yes , 
oh , have you ? 
are you in texas ? 
no , 
i'm in wisconsin , 
oh , really ? 
so it's , 
sounds interesting . 
uh , but , uh , 
so , well 
well , you take it easy , gail . 
bye , now . 
for as far as , um , i would think probably the , uh , worst substance that's probably , um , 
or , started to say the , uh , 
what causes the most air pollution is probably the car 
probably so , 
 and , uh , whether or not , um , they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed , uh , train or something like that 
it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility . 
that's exactly it , 
and that's what we're finding , um , here , where we're at , in minneapolis area , is that people don't want to carpool 
or maybe you don't like the person you would want to carpool with , that kind of thing , 
so it's kind of a thing where , uh , i think the majority of the people do not carpool . 
i think so too . 
i'm in texas 
 and very few people carpool 
 uh , the people that i know don't want to because , uh , they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job 
they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon , you know , 
or if somebody gets sick . 
or if somebody gets sick , and it's not the other person 
that's right . 
and people don't want to give it up 
 but now i think we've made great strides 
that happens quite a bit , 
 but , uh , you know , i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent 
that's very true . 
uh , other than that , uh , i don't know , 
oh , okay , 
five minutes , oh , okay . 
and you're in minneapolis , 
well , is the pollution really bad up there ? 
we have , uh , quite a bit , uh , 
the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone 
you get some pollutants such as those , 
but those are natural 
 um , but there is starting to , 
in minneapolis itself , because of so many people on the highway , there is becoming a problem of pollution , 
and if that's the case , then you have to get your car fixed , 
at least where you   .
we have just had that law , i think , about a year , maybe a year and a half here in texas 
 but , uh , i think it's a good idea 
it's not a bad idea . 
 and , uh , but if they are polluting the air , they do need to have them fixed 
 and you know , there's a big move , especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c s 
 uh , they can't use , 
like , i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business 
 and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning systems 
therefore , the individual , every time they have a service call , if they have an old unit that's still using this twentytwo freon or whatever 
 and , uh , if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c s into the atmosphere 
 uh , the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars , uh , air conditioning , i'm sure 
but it's uncomfortable 
 but , uh , this year my husband recharged our freon because it needed to be done , 
and one of the cans released entire amount 
and , i don't know 
and i was thinking how many other people 
it's probably happened to millions of people , 
 oh , sure , 
i think it's like three or four dollars a can 
 and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car , 
and i thought about that , 
and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it 
inhaled so much of it , 
 but , uh , you think about that , all the people that are using freon and things like that 
well , of course in the , uh , 
i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places , in the hair sprays 
what do you like to watch on television    ? 
well , i guess a lot of the , uh , 
something that's kind of more of a comedy . 
we do have , uh , cable , 
and we have premium stations like h b o and showtime and such , 
and i guess a lot of times when i first turn the t v on , i normally go to those , because i pay for them 
i guess i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there , so i don't end up watching the , um , prime time on some of the standard channels as much , i tend to go to my premium channels first , 
well we have cable , 
but we only have cinemax , 
and we start out with evening shade 
you know 
i'm not always sitting down , 
monday night's pretty good with murphy brown 
that two hours 
 and , uh , now tonight i just finished up with that a woman called jackie , 
but we didn't get to watch it tonight . 
it was pretty good , 
 uh , sometimes i like a dramatization , 
and i like , uh , u s a , when they had their , uh , uh , mystery movies and things , their 
 and , uh , i like those . 
we very seldom watch any , uh , public television , channel thirteen . 
do you watch it much ? 
the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights , starting fairly late , like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight . 
they have some british comedy 
and there's a variety . 
some of them is , uh , black adder or good neighbors or yes , prime minister and are you being served ? 
they rotate those around , 
and , um , we like that british comedy . 
british comedy is very fast , 
you really have to 
now we haven't watched any of those . 
they're real good , 
but they do come on kind of late , 
but we really do enjoy those . 
sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the discovery channel . 
now we have watched some things on that . 
and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there . 
but i'm very intrigued . 
one time i was watching an operation , 
we had , uh , 
i don't know , 
my husband loves uh , that male syndrome of flicking that channel , 
so , you know , and he's sit in front of it 
and he went by 
and he backed up , 
and , you know , there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner 
but our grandchildren like that discovery channel 
 and they just thoroughly , you know , enjoy that 
in fact , i think they were watching something on , uh , whales , or killer sharks , one or the other 
 and , uh , so we have watched that 
 and , uh , otherwise , of course my husband's into the football 
 and , you know , i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else , you know 
i'm not into watching sports . 
now my husband likes to watch football , 
he's not really into , uh , baseball or basketball too much , 
but , uh , football , soon as it's fall , then he likes 
and sometimes now we're getting that , uh , the other football where they play it inside , 
and you know ,   you know , this is too much  , 
saturdays and sunday , this is fine , 
but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring 
and , uh , but uh , he'll flip around , 
i think the other night we had on , uh , uh , it was car races , some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down . 
i don't know what channel he found that on 
 and , uh , but he will turn that on , especially if our , uh , oldest grandson is over here . 
he's ten 
 and , uh , they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it , you know , 
i keep telling them it's the same mentality you know , 
and something's wrong , 
uh , and we very seldom watch television on a friday night or saturday night , because we're not home 
 uh , so , and sundays , uh , we usually have , all of our kids are over on sunday , 
so , you know , we don't get into that , except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos 
do you ever watch that ? 
you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff 
that are sometimes so dumb .
i mean , some of the , 
i mean , i've seen our family in several of those situations .
you want to tell me first how you feel about 
i know , like the mormon religion , you know , they require two years of uh , missionary service 
the boys 
not the girls ,   the boys . 
and , um , so , but i think it would be good for all young people 
i thought it would be good , too , 
but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps 
but there's a lot of other public service things 
oh , sure . 
oh , yeah , 
even in our home towns there's a lot of 
 and i think that art of giving is something that , um , we don't have very much any more . 
i think it would be that . 
when they say this proposal , is this something that they're just suggesting , 
why did they call it a proposal , 
oh , i think they just gave it a title 
 but is this not something that's , um , in legislation or 
that's what i wondered . 
it's just a topic , 
it'd be good character builder . 
i think so , too . 
um , because there's so many , um , kids who have , uh , you know , so much money and so much free time and , uh , nothing to do , um , and nothing to give their time to . 
um , they don't even have a direction to give their time to , 
so i think 
 so , um , yeah , 
it'd be really good 
well , people that uh , they have to go out and do public service 
oh , yeah , 
i agree with you . 
this is something that , um , like you say , is it's character building 
well , i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like , you know , 
oh , i agree with you , 
and i think , uh , young people are so , um , uh , focused just on themselves and their activities , and whose going out with whom , et cetera 
because that's one thing that's hard , with young people , you can't tell them how things are 
they have to see for themselves 
now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years , 
i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done . 
oh , yeah , 
i would think so , like right after , um , high school 
of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction 
course now peace corps , that couldn't be done of course , until they were done with school 
you know , something uh , outside of school 
you know , right after you graduate from , um , high school , because a lot of people are just , um , uh , well gee whiz , what do i do now 
and , uh , you know , having that , uh , gung ho plan 
kind of an inbetween 
so to me , see that would be to do that , would be right after they graduated from high school . 
but as for its being required 
and like i said , now all young people should be able to do something , 
i mean 
oh , right . 
they're just not made to do that type of thing 
 and they just aren't able to do it . 
it'd be good 
but like i said , requiring it would be , uh , 
so what's , uh , things that you look for when you go out to dinner ? 
oh , i just like a nice , quiet , nice atmosphere 
that's always a concern , but just a nice quiet easy place 
well , we don't go out to dinner that much either . 
we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or 
but i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean , you know . 
um , i've been to some that's been terrible . 
you know , you see cockroaches crawling around and 
but i try to get one that's nice and clean 
and then i like you know , good food and good service . 
where you don't feel rushed , you know 
 and you can just relax , and 
so is there some nice places to go to eat in plano ? 
we're almost in dallas . 
we're just north of dallas . 
so we have quite a bit between us and there . 
it's about ten miles 
 and there is all kinds of restaurants 
and , i had one that was a favorite for a long time , 
and then it changed hands and doubled the prices 
and then it finally went out of business . 
so , but it was really nice . 
it had a fireplace . 
um , that sounds beautiful . 
it was really nice . 
they had entertainment sometimes 
but it's gone .
uh , we have , uh , 
excuse me , i didn't think my coughing would come back . 
anyhow , we have only like one , uh , restaurant that's kind of nice . 
you know , they have prime rib on , uh , weekends 
 and then they have about six miles from here is called , a little city called wesley , 
and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food , 
and the atmosphere there is really , really nice . 
oh , that's nice . 
so , and then if we really want to , you know , something different we go to modesto 
but , uh , we don't have any fast foods here in this small city .
that is probably very fortunate for you . 
do you have kids ? 
but he's grown up . 
oh , because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night , you know , 
 so something's happened here , 
but , um , you know , mcdonald's is definitely at the top of her list , 
and i hate these places . 
and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have . 
i'm sure there isn't . 
well , we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around 
 and it's tempting when you come home from work 
and you're tired 
and , you know , you just are tempted to give in to that , 
and it costs a lot of money to do it too . 
i know . 
 you know , it adds up 
and it's not healthy , 
and i really got into that habit for a while , 
but i got out of it again because 
oh , it's foggy and cold here . 
is it ? 
that's what i've heard , yeah . 
and it's . 
have you always lived there ? 
 so i've lived out in california for a long , long time . 
and you like it ? 
we've been . 
we used to live in oakland , 
so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there 
oh , yeah . 
but , uh , then i quit work and everything 
and i bought a house . 
i had a condo in oakland , 
so , right in chinatown , so we went to lots of 
oh , that would be fun . 
and they were really good , 
i really miss them . you know . 
 do you miss living there ? 
uh , no , 
no . 
i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese 
but , uh , as far as missing living there , no . 
it's close enough if i wanted to go there , to san francisco for dinner or something , why , you know , an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and 
but , uh , have you ever been to california ? 
oh , yeah , 
oh really ? 
 and she , um , is a world champion twirler 
 and her coach is in california . 
so she went there for six years . 
so i went out a lot with her . 
and , uh , yeah , 
and i love it , 
but i think he's going to move because i'm the person with more to lose here . 
i have my twelve year old in school 
 and she's happy . 
she always lived here in the south , 
and i have my house , 
and i have to admit that we just moved to plano recently and that i hadn't voted in an election yet , 
and although i did go down and register and i , 
that's the first time i've ever done that . 
what's been your voting experience ? 
 well , do you feel like , uh , 
i mean , i , 
personally i've been very diligent 
for the issues you know , that i felt really strong for , uh , i think apathy has set in to a lot of people 
that's really true . 
that's kind of the way i have felt . 
i also feel guilty , uh , not knowing and not going the extra mile myself and studying out the issues and studying out the candidates . 
course , we only have mostly the representation given in the media , 
but , uh , i have felt since i've been here that i haven't known what the issues were because it was a new community . 
you really do have to study to get yourself , uh , up to par with what is truly going on 
 and that takes a lot of research 
it does . 
i know i'm heavily involved in other things 
 and to take time out and , uh , study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time 
 and i don't have the time to devote to that 
 and , uh , you hopefully find you want the candidates that are running to be honest and aboveboard . 
and unfortunately they are not . 
and , uh , it's really a dilemma , uh , that we find ourselves in , i believe . uh , 
 so i kind of just have taken a back step away and , uh , hopefully that someone will clean up the mess that's there . 
take it , 
because it is a task that is , to me , kind of overwhelming . 
your vote doesn't necessarily elect president . 
they just want to see how close the electoral votes are with the public votes . 
and it's 
it's awful , 
and it's hard to feel like one person , 
but i know that it's important , 
and i feel guilty that i haven't done that here , haven't taken the time 
and i know that , you know , people can make a difference , 
but it's hard uh , and to know what you're up against . 
and it makes me feel bad that , 
i'm glad , 
i mean , i am thankful for the , uh , 
and , uh , 
and i hope that i will 
but i haven't done that so far . 
well , i know that when you're in a smaller community , 
i live in mesquite 
 and , uh , when we have , uh , a local election , say for our mayor and so forth 
i mean , they just give it a small portion of the newspaper , 
but the local newspaper really goes into , uh , quite a bit of history about the candidate 
they raise two sides 
and , uh , there's a pro and a con side 
 and , uh , you can really , uh , feel comfortable in , uh , evaluating that , uh , candidate by , uh , that method . 
uh , i feel pretty confident about the way it's put forth . 
now , i wouldn't say that about the larger cities 
uh , i mean , they've got people that are running that are admitted , uh , criminals and admitted 
you know , i'm sorry , 
but i don't believe in them turning uh , uh , a new leaf 
and , uh , without the lord , they can't do it . 
and it's not very likely . 
i mean , it seems like th , 
i would be committed to that , becau , 
you would be in favor of it ? 
i know that there are many countries that , uh , are very successful with the operation of the government , uh , providing that plan . 
do they have options on uh , you know , like choices of doctors and that type of thing ? 
do you , 
um , i'm not sure how their program is run , 
but i know it has been successful . 
and i would really have to , uh , read the history of , uh , the country that has fared very well with it , 
and i'd like to see uh , the data on that . 
that's the way with me , 
i don't know a whole lot about it . 
i woul , 
that's the only concern i would have , because i think personalities plus the type of doctor it is has a lot to do with the care , 
and if you didn't have any choice 
well i , 
or to change even , like if you didn't approve or didn't think you were getting good service . 
there , that's one of my main concerns . 
 their boy has been sick for several months , 
and they just have found out what's the trouble . 
and they have gone through , uh , one , two , three , four , five doctors and then a team of doctors , 
and they finally determined what the problem was . 
it took that long . 
and the expense of that , yes . 
i don't know how that program works , you know , if you can do that . 
well , part of the benefit 
and i'm sure that they would have a history of each doctor , and hopefully that they would have their , um , accreditations there too . 
i guess that's primarily was one of my thoughts , you know , because , you know how government is .
yes , um , 
but those guidelines have to be set up , 
and i think they should be voted on by the public . 
and , uh , 
for them to have a choice on 
it would . 
 and of course they would give a full plan of what their intentions would be , 
and , um , i think that's primary , uh 
um , i'm not sure what else that , uh , we could address , uh , on health care , uh , other than the fact , i think , uh , the eyes and the ears and the , uh , whole self should be , uh , uh , included in all of that . 
uh , dental , eye care , and , uh , our body 
um , i wouldn't want to have to go for a private doctor for anything and not be covered by the program . 
i know where my son works they have , uh , an option right now where they can have their own physician 
or they can choose one that their company has elected 
 and that costs them less if they take the doctor uh , that the company has selected . 
and does he have an option 
he ge , 
oh , i see .
otherwise you know , the one they have taken . 
and there again , i mean , he's gotten good service . 
he took the less expensive one of course . 
well , if he's pleased with it , i guess that's , uh , the bottom line . 
so , but i would be afraid of what would happen if you had a personality conflict or something . 
cause there's always that opposite story there . 
uh , cause that's the first i've really known anybody that , you know , works for somebody that they had that option , you know , to make the choice 
it's quite different from when i was , uh , under doctor's care , that's for sure . 
i'm very thankful that i'm not .
oh . f you have your health , you're wealthy . 
that's right .
you really are , 
uh , we live in a rural area up here . 
what part of , uh , pennsylvania do you live in ? 
uh , are you familiar with any of the area that all ? 
uh , near , uh , philadelphia . 
oh , well that's a ways away . 
but we live in clarion county . 
uh , we have a cousin that lives in philadelphia , 
and , uh , 
are you a native pennsylvanian ? 
so , i'm a former michiganian 
oh , uhhuh . 
that's a nice state , 
yes it is , 
it's very lovely , 
so i suppose really our situation here is even different that it is in , you know , like more populated areas 
i'm sure it is , 
of course we have good physicians here too , 
we've been pretty fortunate . 
we've had some of the most outstanding doctors in our area for some of the different fields . 
so , uh , we've been pretty fortunate . 
that has broadened so much also . 
oh , yeah , 
that is , the fields that , you know , are opening up are , um , just phenomenal . 
i mean , look at the aids , uh , case 
oh , yeah . 
it's an auto immune deficiency 
 but it sure is a dilly one . 
it sure is . 
i still wish they could do more with the cancer situation , though . 
i do too . 
uh , they just don't seem to be , 
well , there's guidelines that people have to follow , 
and if they're determined to , uh , have their cigarettes and the other 
i guess you , 
but a lot of them don't do these things even , 
and it doesn't seem to matter . 
that's true , too . 
so , uh , it rea , 
i really believe our environment have a lot to do with it . 
well , they say second hand smoke and that , is worse than smoking .
so , what do you do , you know ? 
well , you just have to ban the smoking 
take their rights away from them , they say .
i never had the desire , 
so i haven't ever had that problem , as far as that goes . 
so i can't take any credit for not smoking even . 
well , it's a bad habit tha , 
it's hard to break , 
it's a hard one to quit . 
they say that it is . 
well it was nice talking with you . 
very nice talking to you too , 
and you have a good day . 
and , well , you do the same . 
and , uh , we'll be i guess talking around the country . 
uh , kate , uh , where do you like to eat out ? 
well , uh , we really like the mexican food , you know , here in texas 
 uh , so we try and go around to different mexican restaurants trying them out , 
and so , uh , tia's is probably our favorite , uh , restaurant there , 
and i think they have one of the best services uh , that we really like it . 
do you ? 
have you tried mother mesquites ? 
where's that at ? 
that's at skillman and l b j 
there is , 
it's where skillman , uh , curves into forest lane 
 and it's real good mexican food . 
another real good one is , uh , rafael's down on mckinney avenue . 
they're both very good . 
oh , that , uh , 
we haven't explored , uh , you know , too many places . 
um , you know , lot of the big name brand , i guess , uh , chains 
chains , 
but , um , oh , we've tried places , you know , down , uh , by the collin creek mall , 
the , uh , you know , alvarez , 
and , um , gosh we tried , what was across the street , el paso's 
oh , el chico's or el fenix 
well , i like tia's better than i do el chico's or el fenix . 
uh , much better . 
uh , mother mesquite's is one of our favorites 
but then fajitas are one of my , uh , 
i like it better than just about anything 
oh , yes . 
 and they make very good fajitas there 
especially with butter and honey on them .
oh , i know , 
uh , excellent food . 
i wish i could make them here at home . 
so do i . 
just can't make those flour tortillas . 
well , what else do you like ? 
well , uh , i love seafood 
 and i notice they have like you know , the louisiana purchase , um , 
razzoo's has opened up down , you know , um , um , oh , close to six thirtyfive . 
now i haven't eaten there . 
have you eaten there ? 
i love the food . 
it's a lot of cajun food and 
but , uh , the service has always been so strange , every time i've been in there . 
mostly it's been at lunch time 
 uh , but i hear at night though they have , uh , you know , the outdoor , um , bar , 
and , um , uh , that's it's really , uh , you know , kind of lively . 
so , it's really good . all their blackened grill stuff . 
oh , the spicy , we like atchafalaya's out on belt line , in addison 
 and it's a good restaurant . 
oh , well that sounds great . 
for one of the best fish restaurants in town is either vincent's 
the service is great . 
they have every kind of fish that you could imagine you'd want 
 and the atmosphere is wonderful too . 
if you want a really special night out and fish food 
oh well , and work , 
and so uh , we can eat a lot of fast food .
i can remember when our children were small . 
we lived in the chicago area at the time , 
and we had a lot of mcdonalds 
i know . 
i can't look a mcdonalds in the face now . 
i know , 
i'm so sick of mcdonalds , 
and we used to eat there all the time . 
and , so now we branch out at this wendy's or some other fast food joint . 
oh and cheap too . 
and cheap , 
but the kids , they've got those expensive tastes 
so , uh , they like tia's 
so they can sit down 
sounds like my grandchildren . 
i know . 
they're just spoiled rotten , 
uh , uh , we love to eat out , 
of course , it's just so much easier and simpler 
oh , yes . 
so uh , we usually eat out generally two or three times a week . 
well , it's just my husband and i , 
and it's either t v dinners at home or we go out to eat . 
and i would much rather go out to eat than t v dinners .
oh , me too , 
so , uh , you know , i just work 
and i'm just tired when i get home 
and i just don't feel like cooking . 
oh , no , 
and , uh , you know , on the weekends there's always things to do , 
uh , so we like to go out to lunch on saturdays especially . 
i like breakfast out . 
i like the ihop there in plano . 
now oh , the food just didn't quite settle with me 
 and i don't know what it was . 
oh , now that's surprising 
and i love . 
i like because even if they're crowded , they're fast service , you know 
 um , don't have to wait forever for a table . 
and we also like owens , uh 
 oh , family restaurant . 
we think it's good . 
now i haven't been there befo , 
i went to one i think in ohio or somewhere up there , 
but i've never been to that one here . 
i know it's just down the street . 
it's good . 
so . now have you been to applebee's . 
yes . 
and we like applebee's . 
i really like that too , 
so that was , uh . 
it's fun . 
i like up there in plano , that , uh , country steak house . 
have you tried it ? 
we like it because it's fairly reasonable 
and we go for the salad bar . 
salad bar , 
nancy , do you have any children ? 
and i've been very lucky . 
i haven't needed child care except for my mom . 
i'm a nurse , 
i mean , i go to work early , 
so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for her school or just hangs by while she gets ready 
well , that's nice . 
drives her to school , 
then i'm home to pick her up . 
so i'm very , very lucky .
that is lucky . 
well , how old , um , does a child have to be before you get to stop making arrangements for him , i wonder . 
well , i could do it now . 
but she gets lonely 
and i feel better . 
um , she has a crazy father out there somewhere that i just don't let her out of my sight . 
so , um 
well , and , um , it's nice for them 
she feels that way , you know , 
and we have a neighbor on the next block that she could always walk over there 
but we just feel better doing it this way . 
not after wor , 
we were about to stop one day this year , 
and then her father called the school and made all kinds of threats , 
and so 
oh , no . 
 so , um , you know , you realize that it only takes one second for something to happen . 
she is . 
well , i'm glad you have that , um , opportunity to have your mom . 
i'm glad too .
well , i have two kids 
and , um , so far i haven't had to make a lot of child care arrangements for them because , um , i'm at home now 
but , um , when i was going to school , i would go to school a time that my husband you know , when he was at home 
 so that we would just switch back and forth like that . 
but , um , it's really scary , 
and i would really hate to be in a position to have to find child care .
well , i would , too , because even though a place can look pretty good on the outside , we're finding out now that it's not always on the inside 
 and i just don't know what i would do if 
i know the hospital that i work in is a big hospital 
and they provide child care , 
and of course they charge for it 
 but at least all the nurses can leave their children , 
and they're always watching them , 
they can eat lunch with them , 
if they feel sick they can call them at work and they run over and check on them , 
well , that's nice . 
and i know that i have , um , done some babysitting myself , 
and , uh , 
when i was in school and needed extra money . 
and i know you're taking care of someone else's child and you're forcing yourself to , you know , treat them equally and , you know , better , usually , better than your own 
 um , it's not the same , 
and it made me realize that , um , no one will love your child as much as 
and no one will look out , after them , 
and oh , a big day care 
kinder care and 
rather than having one where they would deliver the children to school in a van or something , 
i would prefer to have in home care , either my own home or a 
just never know . 
i babysat for the little girl next door for a year or so when her parents first got divorced , 
they were the same age , 
and they played together , 
and they were good friends , 
but like you said , you tend to go more for the other one's side 
and so 
it is hard . 
my daughter got jealous 
and , um , it just wasn't the same as when they were just playing as friends , because she had to be there every day . 
so i stopped that after a year , because it was difficult 
and i know , um , when i pick my kids up from school they want to come home . 
and i 
they do . 
so i think , uh , my preference if i had to find day care 
but a lot of people where i live are working just because they want bigger and better , 
and i would never do that . 
i never have done it , 
and i just never would do it . 
i would rather do without some things that really aren't very important compared to being with my child when they're growing up . 
there isn't any time , 
that's true . 
and , uh , by the time they have to eat and have homework and they want some free time , 
and , there's just not enough time in the day to do anything good quality for them , 
but that's really , 
but , uh , just off the top of my head , i don't think i see much wrong with it . 
um , if i owned a company and i wanted to make sure that it was run smoothly and that the people that i had , uh , coming in , uh , were trust worthy , et cetera , and so on , i think i would , uh , probably do the random testing just to insure that my company , uh , runs safely and smoothly . 
uh , but i suspect it very much depends upon the job . 
there are some jobs where i guess it doesn't really , 
and if it's not affecting someone's performance then i'm not sure if it's a problem . 
that's true 
i didn't think about that , 
like for instance ,
then that is something that affects the community . 
you know , if you're drinking or on drugs or whatever , you're driving a city bus you taking several lives in your hands . 
and then if you're a computer operator uh , there's really no big deal , 
i think , you know , 
and for me , i think that drug testing , it follows the path that society is going in . 
if more and more people are using drugs then i think that some people have to guard against people that are using drugs . 
i mean , it's just where society is right now , 
and you know , something we have to cope with 
and i think the drug testing is something that the drug users have to cope with . 
well , in that respect , i think it may help a lot . 
i think it may be hopefully push people away from drug use ,
if you use drugs , you won't get the job . 
that means one of the points of it . 
of course um , i'm not sure , you know , what the time span is , 
but , i mean , if i used drugs last week and i had a , you know , job interview that i wouldn't use drugs the day before or something 
and they wouldn't even see it . 
you know , what i'm saying ? 
i don't know , 
they may not be able to trace it . 
i don't know how far they trace . 
i don't know what the , you know , limits are . 
 i don't know  
that would actually be an interesting thing to find out , i think . 
in the system . 
i've heard some things will stay there for six months , 
some stay for less , 
some stay for longer . 
things like l s d , i guess , stay forever . 
in some ways , 
  you get flashbacks for , uh , forever . 
i guess so . 
 i mean , there  must be something , 
i mean , people get these little flashback things , you know , 
so i don't really know . 
i mean , i don't use any drugs . 
i don't really drink or anything , 
so i'm pretty , uh , uh , i guess , decisive about that , 
just the fact that since i don't use drugs , i have no problem with taking a test . 
well , see , if you actually used drugs at all , 
 and at most a social drinker , 
 so it's never a problem . 
so the only thing i would hate is if i were to go and , uh , 
i mean it's kind of the same thing with the lie detector test . 
if you don't have anything to hide , you're not going to mind it . 
and then there are some things that just aren't peoples business ,
so i think that a lot of people have trouble with that . 
i can understand that . 
i mean , uh , that's really   
i mean , you know , what about the rights ,
what   if they're doing something legal , 
but they would rather have it private ,
like , especially in the case of drinking . 
you know , if someone is something more than a social drinker , shall we say , yet , they're not an alcoholic , what do you do ? 
i mean , i took a lie detector once 
and i didn't mind it , 
but i was just offended by some of the questions , i guess . 
you know ? 
do you hate your mother ? 
have you ever killed your mother ? 
well , those are just , 
those are to get the shock value out of you . 
is that what it was ? 
i'm a graduate student in psych . 
oh , okay . 
and we sort of , you know , figure out , 
um , i know a little bit about that kind of stuff . 
what they're trying to do there is , they want to sort of get a base line measure for you , you know . 
how is it that when you see these things you know , 
but with them they have no idea if you're just sort of jumping ,
it can be shocking 
  they ask why i was going , 
what in the world are you asking me about here . 
i don't know .
well , i guess so , 
i mean , i guess , i don't know uh , if you have killed your mother .
big jump there . 
i think it's their way of saying how well you do ,
that makes me feel a little better .
of course , that was years and years ago . 
and i don't think that you killed your mother though , 
i wouldn't worry about that . 
because in society a lot of people are taking drugs . 
there is also people that are getting off drugs and trying to do better with their lives . 
but they take a lie detector test or a drug test , or whatever 
and the stuff that happened to them , you know , five years ago comes up 
and it spoils their chances for just making it a little better . 
you know , when they might be actually trying to ,
that's , uh , you know , it could blow things right away for them , you know . 
 and i'm off them for a year now . 
  i'll be happy to take the test , 
but it will show up positive . 
i would probably do that . 
and i would probably bring something in showing that i had been to such and such hospital for help or , you know , 
or whatever it is that they do . 
although then , they can't legally discriminate , i think on the basis   .
but i don't really know . 
i don't know what the laws are pertaining to this . 
my wife probably does . 
i'm not sure what they are either . 
i don't   .
oh , i   .
i mean , i think about it because i hear about it , 
i'm not real sure what i think about it . 
i'm kind of , you know , in the middle on that one . 
well , these are tough . 
i sort of like that stuff , 
it makes you think . 
so i think that's real good . 
it was very nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you to . 
take care . 
well , i think we pay too much in taxes . 
how about you ? 
well , i think they waste what we pay . 
excuse me ? 
i think they waste all the money that we pay .
that's what i think too . 
i don't know how you feel , um , 
we moved here from another state . 
we lived here before , went out and came back , 
and that particular state had an occupational income tax , but no sales tax . 
and what you find out is , one evil is the same as the other . 
here there's no occupational tax 
but it's a heavy sales tax . 
so they get you coming and going . 
now it's even higher in dallas county , 
 i know , it's just , um . 
it's eight and a quarter i think . 
i was shocked . 
i went , 
we bought a new washer 
so it's really kind of sad , 
and then i don't know how , you know , in terms of when you all do your federal , 
but it just seems like , if you're strictly middle income , it seems like you get hit the worst . 
is that what you think ? 
and then the people that make , you know , five hundred thousand dollars and higher than that , they don't have to pay , 
and sometimes they have to pay even less taxes . 
because they have the money to shelter things 
and , i don't know , somehow get a , huh  , 
oh , i thought you were going to say something . 
they somehow seem to get around these , 
the things that we can't , you know , 
don't make that kind of money . 
i don't know . 
i mean , if they're in business , and they're making money , 
i could see if they're losing money , 
but they're making money 
then they should pay taxes then . 
i know , 
and just somehow it doesn't seem , you know , 
and then , you 
mean you look at like , uh , that country singer , uh , what's his name , willie nelson . 
some , he didn't look that stupid . 
in a way , it's almost like he had so much debt that , uh , filing bankruptcy was a way to get out of all of it 
i just file federal income tax every year . 
so i'm single again . 
as the people that make the same amount of money and they're married . 
 and right now , we don't own any property . 
we lease . 
so we're in the same , 
we don't have children , 
so we're in the same kind of , 
it's not as bad as being single and divorced , 
but if you have like x point five children and earn , you know , you kind of get hit with , you know , 
i mean , it doesn't even pay for me to earn a good wage , because , 
doesn't that sound stupid . 
so it's kind of hard . 
whoever works less , they can get a tax credit for that . 
excuse me . 
if both of the spouses 
otherwise you're just , you know , 
and if you have kids , you get like seven hundred fifty dollars or something .
well , it's two thousand now . 
oh , it is . 
oh , my . 
well that's not too bad . 
then you get a child care exemption , 
but it's not enough , you know . 
i mean , you pay from fifty to a hundred dollars a week in child care 
 and they only give you like , i think it's about five or ten percent of that . 
oh , my goodness . 
you know , it's not even , 
i guess i better go .
oh , okay . 
 well it was nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
what part of the country are you in ? 
 uh , pennsylvania . 
oh , you are ? 
oh , are you really ? 
what part of pittsburgh ? 
um , the south hills area , beaver county , well originally beaver county   .
and , uh , where are you from ? 
uh , clarion county . 
oh , okay , 
i know where that is . 
we live out in the country . 
that's pretty out there . 
what , well , 
we have two children that live in pittsburgh .
oh , okay , 
i got my brother and my whole family there . 
i'm talking to you from dallas right now . 
oh , oh , you are ? 
do you work for texas instruments then ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
and how about you ? 
i'm just , 
so , yeah . 
well that's okay . 
i guess it's an easy thing to do . 
so you have a big , 
uh , we have a big old farmhouse that we've 
oh , that's a , 
those are beautiful . 
it had been , you know , of course , a farm . 
it's a farm community , 
and we . 
is it a working farm 
or is it ? 
ours is not a working farm .
i can understand that , 
that's probably what i would , uh , 
i have a garden 
but you know , 
we have a garden . 
but we don't farm . 
i can hear the accent now 
i hear the  , 
uh , we lived in minneapolis for about five years . 
we originally lived in dallas 
and we met and got married 
 and then , um , actually married in pittsburgh , 
at any rate we came back here with , 
my husband was transferred around , uh , up to minnesota and now back to texas with t i 
 and we're leasing a , uh , two story town home in a section of dallas they call north dallas . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and it's , uh , near a little town called plano , 
well , it's not little any more . 
uh , grapevine , 
do you know grapevine ? 
uh , yes , 
that's about fortyfive miles from us . 
my brother has a home there he's trying to sell . 
in maryland 
but , uh , he ,
minneapolissaint paul is very clean 
and in terms of housing down here , um , you really have your pick 
but it's just everything's overpriced for the economy . 
oh , it's terrible . 
it really is , 
i mean we're in a leased town home , 
and your teeth will probably fall out figuratively speaking , it's nine hundred a month . 
oh , i'm not surprised . 
if you get anything under five hundred you get into what they call high density living 
uh , right , 
 and i just have no tolerance for that . 
it's not good .
and the people think the income is really great in some of those areas 
but when they sit down and look at what it costs to live 
 and , uh , of course , most of the homes are , you know , fairly nice , 
they're , uh , done up fairly nice , uh , 
it's like a duplex , 
like a two by two they call it like in pittsburgh . 
and it's nice 
but i mean , the girl bought it for a hundred and ten , 
and now she can't sell it . 
and our neighbors , 
well , prices have come down on the homes , the duplexes . 
i mean , our neighbors , the attached on the other side , they're very nice , thank god , 
they paid fiftyeight for it . 
oh , my heaven . 
that's how bad it , 
i know . 
well , i know up in connecticut the same thing happened , 
that's right . 
i have some friends that live in westport 
and it's really , really bad . 
i mean you , 
but we like our area . 
it's an old house and everything 
 but , uh , 
where is clarion county in relation to , actually , 
because we're considering moving to pennsylvania .
 well , we're about a hundred miles from pittsburgh 
that's not too bad . 
and yeah , 
are you going up toward , uh , uh , 
i'm trying to think of the name of that town that starts with an m , 
bradford , no that's too far north . 
bradford's north of us . 
so you're not that far north then , 
well , you're really not too bad . 
um , was it a home that you've had for quite a few years , 
well , we've been here since sixtysix . 
oh , then you have , 
do you have a lot of land 
uh , we have fifty acres . 
oh , my , 
well , then . 
oh , pardon me , 
we have forty , 
we gave ten to one of our children .
there you go . 
did you have a hard time getting used to , 
do you feel like you live in an isolated area 
and towns keep creeping closer and closer , you know . 
i think that that's , um , 
i can remember in pittsburgh when , 
this has to do with homes , uh , indirectly 
but i can remember when upper saint clair was out in you know , 
we have , 
oh , well that's okay , um , 
but we live about ten miles from probably three or four , not large towns but , you know , reasonable . 
but , sub , 
substantially , you know . 
um , do you like living in an older home and restoring it like that ? 
uh , yeah , 
we don't want to do too much more .
how big is it ? 
how many square feet do you have ? 
i really . 
well how many rooms do you think , 
we have , uh , uh , four rooms downstairs , and a pantry 
 and upstairs we have a bath , oh 
we , have a half bath downstairs , too . 
we have a bath upstairs , and one , two , three , four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room .
and , uh , 
a junk room , 
i understand , 
we have that too . 
that's large if your children aren't at home any more . 
we li , 
a lot of people say that 
but , um , 
we just like it real well 
it's enough space for two people .
we had five children , 
oh , okay . 
they're all out on their own now . 
that's okay . 
well , we've got , um , 
this town house is pretty big . 
it's about eighteen hundred square feet . 
it's got three bedrooms , two and a half baths 
 um , it's really nice . 
well , it sounds like a good buy . 
it is , 
i mean , i would never buy it 
but leasing it is fine . 
um , but , it's just again , the privacy , you know . 
um , we had a house in minneapolis that was on three acres , 
and my husband was raised , um , on a working farm near dayt , 
oh , that makes a big difference . 
near dayton , ohio , 
and he said , you know , 
to where there's more land . 
you really aren't isolated because it's , 
the advantages , 
your home is far enough away that you're not bothered by being too close to people , 
but yet you can have your friends , uh , 
you can have them in , 
you can go out . 
you have more of a choice , 
you're not pressed upon as bad . 
that's kind of what , like 
his parents have , uh , land that they retired to , um , about a hundred miles out of atlanta 
and it is too far south for me , 
uh , uhhuh . 
um , um , but i mean , they have one of the , um , 
when they said log cabin , i just laughed , 
that they retired to , 
but they built one of these . 
i mean , it's just beautiful . 
it's like a custom , you know 
it's not like what i would think of when i think of old log cabins . 
you know , i mean , it's modern 
more luxury . 
it's beautiful , 
it's country 
it's you know , um , 
but , uh , i don't , 
what else about housing except it's , uh , well , 
pittsburgh's housing economy , i think it's holding it's own . 
uh , they're , 
both of our children who live there have just bought a home . 
what sections are they in ? 
that's nice . 
and , uh , the one boy , the house they bought is completely livable . 
they didn't have to do much to it . 
the other one you know , needs more work done . 
it's twenty years old , i think . 
but they have two children , too , 
and they 
a really good friend of mine lives in penn hills , 
and they've been in their house , oh , probably about twelve years now 
 and , um , it's , you know , 
they're going to start to see their return 
um , but it's a beautiful home 
they are beautiful homes . 
i mean , he lives all in that same area going from mount lebanon , um , 
it's real pretty up there . 
it's just , 
it is , 
it's real nice . 
and the neighborhoods are stable 
it's , uh , 
when you come to this part of the country , we've been away from dallas long enough that you see the difference in housing . 
oh , my 
you do when you mo . 
when we first got married , uh , 
my husband works for the state , 
and we moved once a year usually .
oh , my goodness . 
and then after they had to start paying to move us ,
that's what it is here , 
that's why we're at a point now uh , we're adopting 
and we have been married ten plus years 
and what happens is , uh , you just realize that once you get to a certain age the next house that you get .
right , yeah , 
you have to stop some place , 
that's kind of like 
so we're considering pennsylvania , 
and we're just kind of , you know , toying with what exactly , where we want to be , you know . 
a lot of people say it doesn't matter where they live if they have a nice house 
you know , they buy a place 
and they just hate the area . 
i know , 
it's steady , 
but it's still not going up . 
and um , i just refuse to buy it , um , if i know i'm not going to be there for at least 
well , my brother , they're having trouble selling their home , see . 
oh , i'm sure , 
there , i mean , you can go down a street , 
and here , he told you this , every other house , you know , if it's been foreclosed on 
oh , yeah , 
 um , it's really , i mean , 
and it's hard to sell the properties . 
people from j c penney's from new york , came here about a couple of years ago . 
and they thought they were getting a great deal , um , because they could get a five hundred thousand dollar home with , they call it , zero lot lines , no property , 
oh , uhhuh . 
i mean it would probably be like your house on , uh , you know , a half a city block in pittsburgh or something . 
i couldn't handle that .
i know , 
and that's , you know , like 
i can look outside right now and look into the next unit . 
you know , it's across the way , 
and it's landscaped and all that with azaleas , 
but it's still not that private . 
i get tired , uh , sometimes , mowing , because we mow , you know , a good bit of ground around the house area . 
and i do get tired of that 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i don't think i'd want to change it . 
and your kids have , 
to tell you the truth , um , i think that if you can keep that way , you know , kind of like a homestead , 
hi , uh , 
 basically , i wear pants . 
i'm a real pants person 
and , uh , like when i'm at home since , 
and i'll say , i'm a homemaker since that's my basic thing , uh , 
i wear a pantsuit most of the time . 
not a pantsuit , 
i guess pants and a shirt 
and , uh , in the summertime i wear cotton tops . 
cotton top shirts 
and in the winter i wear , uh , like sweaters . 
i like sweaters a lot . 
and so i do that . 
but when i go out for meetings  , uh , then i will wear either , uh , skirts or , uh , a dress 
and i have a couple of pantsuits because those are real in at this time , 
but , that's basically what i do . 
well , i think our tastes are fairly similar , 
although i am i government worker , i do tend to , 
i'm , uh , a scientist . 
so that technically , 
i suppose , i could get away with extremely casual clothes , 
but , for the most part i don't . 
i wear fairly respectable looking shoes 
and , uh , i guess dress it up have visitors or have to give talks . 
well , that sounds nice . 
do you change much through the season 
but , uh , no , 
i don't know whether they think by , you know , freezing them up overnight , then they can save electricity during the day or something . 
so , right , 
uh , yeah , 
you know , i'm not a clothes horse in the sense that some of my friends . 
and i guess although in , as i recall the stereotype of secretaries was , you know , overdress , over kill , sort of 
although the fact that most of the ones i know are in the government and they're not meeting the public 
i mean , i suppose if you were more a receptionist and meeting the public and it was the image of your company at stake 
then may , .
uh , well , i don't have the resources to just go out and buy , buy , buy anyway 
and so my don't change dramatically over the years . 
if i need something new , i will go and buy it . 
but , basically i'm a pretty much the same 
in the summertime i wear the light cotton 
and in the wintertime i change to the sweaters . 
and , so , it's not a whole lot of change for me either . 
and , uh , especially when i go to the meetings and wear the dresses 
i enjoy that , 
but it just wouldn't be , uh , smart for me to do that in my home with my children . 
so , i have to , uh , think about things like that , too . 
i have given seminars before in creative writing and things like that . 
now , i don't know if they consider that a job . 
i don't really get paid for that , uh , often , 
but , uh , when i do that then i think i become more businesslike . 
uh , but it doesn't really change my clothing style . 
i mean , you can look businesslike the same pant suit you would , you know 
i'm really glad about that pant suits are popular because i'm allergic to many of the synthetics . 
and so i used to have a problem when i was working in a restaurant while i was in college 
oh , dear . 
that's not helpful . 
but otherwise , now , i guess we're both pretty practical .
i guess so .
well , it's been great talking to you . 
have a great day . 
 well , have a good day . 
what do you think ? 
well , uh , uh , what the citizens do , 
although i do see this as uh , something that definitely needs to be taken care of . 
a different question i think , as far as i'm concerned . 
or , or , or drug testing . 
uh , i was drug tested when i came to my job here at t i . 
i think it should be more by the private institution . 
how about you ? 
they should , uh , have drug screening before they hire 
and , uh , any time that an employee , 
like if they're coming to late work all the time and , uh 
i agree with you . 
and this is why , i mean , uh , drugs are the biggest problem , i think to face america today . 
i mean it's what drives crime , 
it's what drives , uh , uh , any sort is somewhat , uh , uh , driven by drugs 
and i think that , uh , were corporations and , uh , private industry to some control over that . 
we , you know , 
if you can't work , take drugs or whatever , 
i don't know . 
course , that might up crime , you know , when , uh , people go in and steal your television and ste , and sell it just because they can't work anymore , you know . 
but you got to have a safe work place . 
that's all there is to it . 
you're definitely right . 
that , uh , you can't have it any other way . 
uh , you know , uh , you know , w , 
if it's a policeman and he's working with , uh , the public or even , you know , if it's a guy at mcdonald's cooking a burger , i think , they're dangerous in either situation . 
uh , i , 
what do you think , uh , 
what percentage of corporations and , uh , private industry do you think use , uh , drug testing ? 
i think it's more frequent now . 
it's probably like forty , fifty percent . 
oh , really ? 
because , uh , all the jobs that i've applied for have , uh , mentioned some type of drug screening . 
what kind of work are you in ? 
and i just do warehouse work . 
and did they give you drug testing ? 
they hired me in nineteen eightyfour 
but now uh , they issued a statement 
oh , so are they going to , uh , begin spontaneous , uh , drug testing ? 
it was more about , uh , all the people's problems . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , and , uh , they sent out the employee assistance cards for anyone that had any sort of drug problem or work related problem . 
family problems , you know . 
but i know they have a lot of drug problems 
what do you think about , uh , you know , 
something that kind of concerns me is , uh , for whatever work we happen to do . 
do you think there should be drug testing for political officials ? 
i do , too . 
you know , they're hypocritical . 
they talk against drugs 
 and then they get caught , you know . 
whether it's drugs or any other kind of , uh , 
like the money laundering scams . all that was drug related . 
oh , yeah . 
and that cost us , the country , you know , billions of dollars . 
i would agree with you . 
uh , to put any trust into our political officials if they don't , you know , uh , 
just doesn't make sense to worry about legislation unless they're doing that themselves . 
doug , you want to start ? .
you don't use any credit cards , i don't imagine . 
of course i use ,
i have a couple of credit cards 
do you use them a lot ? 
we're on a pretty strict and tight budget . 
we use the credit cards , however , when we're at a situation where we don't have either the cash or the checkbook handy . 
or we use credit cards also , if we want to get an extended warranty on an item that we're purchasing . 
oh , well , that's an idea , 
that's a thought , 
and basically we use it mainly when we're traveling 
 and so when we're traveling some . 
do you use credit cards often ? 
my husband loves them .
uh , we do use them . 
uh , we try not to , 
but , he's one who believes in credit cards , 
and he uses them quite a bit . 
he likes using them and then just pay at the end of the month .
oh , yeah , 
he likes that , 
 and they just pay the minimum required balance . 
and that's when you get into expenses . 
and you get in over your head . 
it'll , uh , 
some people i know also try to use it as float 
and then i can 
when i'm being paid . 
well , sometimes you do come on bargains and that , 
and it's really useful . 
that's true . 
and some places won't take , you know , like personal checks or cash , even 
 but they would take a credit card . 
credit card rates in pennsylvania ? 
for example down here , when you go up to a gas station 
are they the same there ? 
so we don't deal where they do that .
you know , we go to places where they don't charge extra . 
some of them charge five cents a gallon , even , 
like the gas stations more , 
that's pretty steep . 
and , uh , we just try to avoid , you know , the ones that do that , 
we just don't , uh , go there 
to me they are , anyway , 
because you make the deduction at the time of the purchase 
and so that 
very good . 
i guess , good faithful shoppers that don't get into a problem when it comes to budgeting their money . 
well , i can't say we never have . 
now we have , you know , at times , made payments 
but we try not to . 
we try hard , 
well , yeah , 
well , i see that as an advantage to a credit card , also 
that you can 
so i think that there's a great advantage to a credit card in those situations . 
because sometimes , uh , there's times when you maybe couldn't take advantage of something 
 but with a credit card you can . 
um , do you have , uh , multiple credit cards ? 
and do you find that advantageous 
well , i think we're narrowing it down , actually . 
uh , uh , like i said , my husband likes them , 
and we have quite a few , 
but when you get down to the nitty gritty , there's probably three that we use 
we're actually in the same boat . 
we like to use three , uh , basic credit cards . 
that way we're not confused 
and we don't have an awful lot of expenses or surprises when it comes 
and , do you find that you get an awful lot of credit card applications through the mail ? 
oh , yes . 
once a week , 
twice a week , 
or three times a week . 
well , it's not every week , 
but you do get them . 
they make it very readily available . 
almost too much so . 
but i really don't like it the charges that , you know , 
we try to look at that also , 
what they charge per year 
so the annual fee . 
they're charging us to spend our money , 
and , i'm not real crazy about that , 
so we try to look at that also . 
so there is the basic annual fee for the credit card 
such as how much time , well , 
how much time do you spend with your children , 
and how many do you have ? 
we have two children , 
they're both grown and married 
and we have , uh , 
our daughter has three sons , 
so we see them at least once a week , 
and we see our son and his wife uh , about every other week 
and , uh 
so we're a fairly closeknit family . 
we're together a lot on special days 
uh , and of course , with the holidays and everything . 
well , you're very fortunate . 
uh , my , uh , 
i have two girls and a son , 
 and my oldest daughter lives in amsterdam , holland . 
she  , 
so it's kind of hard for us to visit with them , as much as i'd like to .
oh , yes . 
i play in several symphony orchestras 
and , uh , her husband builds forte pianos , 
which are harpsichord size pianos . 
pianos , uhhuh . 
and , uh , that's why they're over there . 
and then i have a son who lives in , uh , warrington , pennsylvania . 
and i get to see him maybe once every three months . 
so we've lost , you know , 
i'd like to have an everyday contact with children , uh , as well as you do , for that matter , 
and  young   , my youngest daughter lives in new jersey , 
and so they , 
 oh , you don't get to see any of yours very often . 
she works in these , um , trump type casinos , 
she and her husband both do . 
they work , 
 and , uh , they're running lights right now and audio and  that thing  for , 
but anyhow uh , 
what activities do you do with your children when you are together ? 
oh , most the time , 
well , right now it's football season , 
and our daughter is a big cowboy fan , 
as is our husband , 
so , my husband , 
so she watches that 
and i play with the grandchildren .
i enjoy the grandchildren . 
but , now , like last weekend , um , there's the soviet space exhibit is here in dallas , 
and it ends ,
so she and the three boys and my husband and i went over into fort worth to see the space exhibit 
and this sunday , 
the soviet space exhibit ? 
my goodness . 
i am surprised they would bring anything over here . 
i think it came here in either september or october 
i'll bet . 
and it's been very well done .
uh , and uh , next sunday they're coming over after the cowboy game 
and , uh , 
then when our son's over , we have a pool , 
and he and his wife come and a lot of their friends , 
and we have cookouts on sunday uh , 
 well , that sounds like you have really , 
 and , uh 
and we 
we've taken a lot of trips with our kids when they were younger . 
uh , we're very family oriented . 
and the kids seem to enjoy being with us , 
and their friends enjoy being with us . 
so that keeps us very , very young , with all these young people passing in and out and eating , 
and seems like i've , 
the only problem is , it keeps you pretty busy , keeping everything going , 
doesn't it ? 
i'm worried about christmas . 
christmas eve they all pass through , 
and then they all end up spending the night christmas eve night , so that , 
 and they go out to you know , the inlaws in between some of this , 
but they're all , 
uh , then have christmas dinner with us and then go to other inlaws and things , 
so we see a lot of them . 
but we enjoy christmas eve night , because they all start arriving by about eleven o'clock , 
and we open presents about five o'clock christmas , 
uh , then , 
and my sister and her husband are coming down , 
so there's going to be eleven of us for christmas . 
that's great . 
there's a , 
and you seem to be making out all right . 
sometimes i'm a little exhausted .
 well , tell me , 
uh , of the current trends of how other people spend time with their children and so forth ? 
 oh , i think the trends are going back to spending more time with families . 
i think parents are definitely , uh , spending more and more time . 
i don't think they're leaving them with babysitters , you know . 
i think family quality time is becoming much more important than it was there 
seems like it went through a spell there where families weren't that big a deal . 
parents kind of went and did their thing , 
kids did their thing . 
well , that's 
that's exactly what i was going to say . 
of course , i find now that i spend more time with my grandchildren in 
i know more about them and watch their growth and how they improve and learn much more so than my own kids . 
when your own children are growing up , you just take them for granted 
and you go ahead and do your thing 
do you have any children ? 
uh , yes , 
i don't any children  , 
so i'm going to have difficulty with this topic . 
oh , okay . 
but , uh , what kinds of things do you and your family do ? 
um , well , we go out and fly kites 
and we go fishing . 
and we go to movies 
and we go out to the farm . 
and , uh , she likes to pick flowers and look at birds . 
um . then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days . 
i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that . 
that's great . 
well , i'm divorced , 
but when she's with me that's what we do . 
and we color a lot 
and i read her stories . 
that's great . 
i think a lot of families now , they probably don't spend enough time together . 
you know , whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together 
and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed . 
just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing 
and , uh , i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot . 
and the communication just build your family . 
and when i was , uh , living with her with did stuff then too , 
to me that's pretty rare . 
i know . 
i like that . 
whenever i do have children see that we spend a lot of time together , you know , 
maybe just even , if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time . 
you know , that's good sometimes because you need to , you know , get away . 
but , um , i don't think the family unit . 
that's right . 
because then you never get to know them either . 
they're all grown up 
and their , 
and as i understand it , 
i don't know , 
i haven't experienced it , 
and once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve , you know , you've pretty much lost them .
they're out doing stuff by that time . 
so , um , do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter ? 
and whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays , we'll see other families . 
but , not usually on the weekends we don't see very many in comparison . 
what do you think is the key to just bringing the american family back together ? 
what kinds of things do you think can ? 
well , i think they can turn off the t v for one thing .
that's true . 
because she always likes to do things whenever the t v s off . 
you know , she'll forget about the t v completely . 
and i know i'm guilty of it . 
like i came in from work today 
first thing i did was turn the tv on .
and i like to watch 'em 
but , i think that's that is a big problem . the television 
and it's too static , you know , 
it's something that you can do 
but there's no thinking involved , no motion , you know , 
and i think that's another reason why people are , uh , so health conscious now is because america's becoming really a couch potato society . 
you know , people aren't doing anything just sitting around , you know , no thinking involved 
and now , i think people are trying to get out of that . 
at least 
and um , there's a lot of um , 
it's becoming really health conscious 
and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that . 
and that's probably good , you know , 
if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that , that also helps . 
that's also something , you know , family oriented that everyone can do . 
but uh , when she was here last summer we played tennis 
but she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately . 
how old is she ? 
she's five . 
um . well , she has , 
we just been hitting the ball on the ground . 
she can't hit it in the air yet , 
and then we kick the ball . 
we play like soccer . 
you've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years .
that's good . 
well it was very nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
i don't have a boat , 
but i like to fish 
and there's a lot of lakes around here . 
uh , are there many lakes up there ? 
the great lakes , you know , 
uh , lake ontario is right near here . 
plus , we're in what's called the finger lake region of new york 
where there're lots of small lakes everywhere 
and these are , uh , real good , uh , for , like , you know , bass fishing and so forth . 
they have mostly small mouth in them 
uh , there's , 
we have large mouth , small mouth , uh , sort of musky , pike , stuff like that . 
you know , all sorts of fun stuff like that . 
uh , we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on lake ontario every year . 
oh , yeah , 
that's right , 
so that's , a lot of fun . 
how about you ? 
what do you like to go for ? 
oh , it's , uh , 
i fish for bass , 
but i hardly ever catch one , 
but , uh , uh , they have a tail race over in lake lavon 
 and , uh , you know , when they open up the dam and let out water , they wash down the fish 
and , uh , you catch that white bass and crappie out of there . 
every once in a while there'll be striped bass . 
we have , uh , some friends who live on the lake 
 and , or cat or whatever , and some other strange stuff . *[[listen
but in this particular lake , we went out with some friends , once 
and every time you tossed the line in , you pull up a five , six , seven inch minimum bass 
and usually you pull up , you know , thirteen to fourteen inch bass . 
we pull up , you know , bass after bass 
probably during perch season the perch will run in very large schools , 
so what they'll do is j , 
you'll be sort of boating around , 
these people own a little row boat , 
and they'll be boating around 
and they'll hit a school of perches in the middle 
 and when they do , you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at , 
they just drop it in . 
they can't pull it in fast enough . 
what do you catch perch on ? 
uh , they , 
according to them , when the perch are running , you can catch them on just about anything . 
they tend to use , i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes , 
but , you know , i've , 
she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything , you know . 
corn or salami or bread or anything , 
they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded , these large schools . 
sometimes i use corn , 
but , uh , uh , some fish steal it off the hook sometimes . 
it's a big problem . 
uh , the other day i was fishing with bread , uh , 
there's a college across the street 
 and they , 
it's full of carp and , uh , i caught a carp on a , about , what size is that , uh , i think it was a number two treble hook , 
 and it's huge , 
its mouth was full of hooks . 
so he was in a bad way . 
but , uh , it's , 
he was fast . 
a big one ? 
well , it's , uh , it was sixteen inches long . 
wow , that's a nice size carp . 
but all they're good for is the fight . 
boy they really don't want to come out of the water 
how your line goes , you know 
 and i thought , you know , that , uh , i wasn't going to be able to get it in , because , uh , the one i hooked just about ten minutes before , when i tried to raise it out of the water , it fell off , 
so it wasn't hooked very well . 
but , you know , i got it that far , 
i figured that , uh , 
that counts . 
that's what i said . 
that's what i told the guy . 
the guy was standing there 
and he laughed when it fell off 
 do you actually like the taste of f , 
do you , like , eat the fish that you catch 
uh , catfish , yeah . 
but , uh , i haven't eaten anything else , you know . 
uh , there's some , uh , 
my dad has a farm 
and there's , 
he has two ponds up there 
and my uncle has a pond upstream 
and there's a lot of crappie in there now . 
but , uh , i think he's the only one that's , that's caught or , a big enough crappie to eat . 
but the catfish , you know , there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and , that , 
so you can just , oh , 
because i don't actually like fish . 
it's sort of , 
so when i fish , it's more for sport than anything else . 
and if , you know , 
when you have to look in their eyes and , you know , hit them in the head or whatever , that's what you do with a catfish 
and be careful you don't get stung . 
i know it . 
have you ever tried , uh , deep sea fishing ? 
my brother went off the coast of maine , uh , 
when the , 
i don't know , 
what they , 
he said that it was just like that . 
they were throwing like , uh , uh , hell benders or , uh , uh , some other kind of treble hook lure 
and , uh , each time they bring them in they'd have at least one , 
sometimes they've had you know , one on every hook . 
i was out in florida with a friend a while ago 
and we would go and just , uh , drop two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat . 
we just dropped it down there 
and , the captain had , you know , some kind of sonar in the boat 
 so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish 
and you just drop it in and it just , 
you get one or two at a shot , you know 
it was a , like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat . 
you know , and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want . 
down here it's like two hundred dollars a day . 
well , this is , 
this was for a , you know , large , 
there were 
a group party . 
we weren't all related , just , you know , thirty people off the shop in the boat there . 
if you want to go on a boat alone , it's like two hundred dollars a day . 
but this is great , because i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something . 
you know , 
so you'd get to go out there and fish all day . 
it's really nice .
it's real enjoyable . 
i think we're probably close , though . 
it's nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you , too . 
good luck with fishing this season . 
good luck . 
what do you think about the benefits in jobs ? 
um , i'm relatively satisfied with the benefits i have . 
i think that , um , our health insurance is terribly expensive . 
i'd rather that we got a bit more coverage for a lot less money . 
but , um , you know , that's my major complaints , i guess . 
what about you ? 
so that leaves you paying for all of it . 
or maybe that it's not understood what should be covered and what isn't . 
and , if , 
it's the type that if you go to a certain doctor then , uh , you just pay ten dollars 
and then , uh , the insurance pays the rest of the bill . 
or if you go outside you get , uh , seventy thirty . 
now we , 
i have just the regular insurance so that any doctor is covered 
but what i found recently is what they've been doing is they poll somehow the area , 
and then they have what they consider a justifiable price for the area where your doctor is located based on zip code . 
and so recently , when we had a claim , um , they didn't pay the eightyfive percent they paid much lower 
and they're probably doing it to their benefit , anyway . 
i would assume that you know , whatever doctors are willing to do the paperwork and send it in . 
but it's difficult . 
what about other benefits ? 
are there others that you're dissatisfied with ? 
well , i work for sears , 
the only real benefit you have , is health insurance . 
well , you have vacation , i mea , 
but everybody gets vacation . 
i mean , like , uh , t i and some other places , you know , they have recreational facilities , 
and they have a driving range and weight room 
and , you know , i think they even have a swimming pool 
 and i don't know if they have any tennis courts or anything like that . 
i'm not familiar with that sort of thing , 
but you know , to me vacation is an issue , 
and i mean , different places have different amounts of vacation , i would assume . 
and , um , you know , the leniency with which they let you take leave without pay , perhaps or , um , i don't know , i suppose , um , sick days . 
some places count the number of hours 
and some places just sort of believe you . 
um , ours is based on number of days , 
and , you know , people try to build them up in case they really do get seriously ill . 
but , um , otherwise , i'm not aware of any problems with the benefits around here .
well , i don't know , the working conditions , you know , if you could include that in benefits . 
some places aren't very safe to work . 
that you have to work under . 
or maybe would be the allowing you to use the telephone for personal calls . 
um , but , you know i suppose some places are more stringent about that than others . 
i think so . 
and , maybe arriving late or something like that , you know , 
how they enforce the rules . 
but other than that i don't have much feeling for the benefits , 
since , like i said , um , i don't have a big problem with them . 
um , in texas because , um , um , how much it costs the employers 
 and a lot of them are going to their own insurance now . 
and it reduces some of the length of the benefits , uh , and i don't know besides that . 
but i noticed right off that was a year less than what the state was allowing . 
but they buy their own instead of going through the state . 
oh , i see . 
so apparently it costs less that way . 
i suppose that whenever companies can avoid , um , benefits , it's to the benefit of the company 
 and at least , you know , financially in the short run , 
but i would think they would get a much greater turnover 
and that people would be dissatisfied 
that's what i think 
they should be able to judge their benefits on how happy their employees are 
and how much profit they're making 
and then have everybody be unhappy and have a constant turnover of people . 
i mean , sure , the payroll is lower that way , 
but i would assume that the productivity is way down , also . 
the productivity and the training costs , 
if they have to train a new employee every six months , then i don't see how they can save money . 
you know , and once they once they get somebody good , they ought to hang onto them . 
that's right . 
i agree . 
it was nice talking to you . 
well thank you for calling . 
well , she lives in utah , 
oh , uhhuh , 
that's the way we always were . 
we always lived away from our family and relatives while the kids were growing up . 
let's do i , 
so , you ready ? 
my children are all gone already . 
they're all out on their own . 
so , uh , do you want to start first 
i stay home most of the time 
but i know that it's very difficult when you want your children to be taken care of . 
um , you know , there's a , 
my neighbor she tends children though 
or not . 
and , um , you know , there's pros and cons on both side of that 
 because if they were , then you kind of know that they had to go through some kind of testing ,
yet most of the problems we hear , 
of course , maybe that's what we hear about is from organized and approved day care centers . 
that's right . 
but maybe we don't hear about the other ones though that could be . 
you know , the individual incidence or something . 
uh , now , usually when i have someone tend , um , 
my oldest tends for me now if i go somewhere 
how old ,
he's almost a teenager .
oh , well , he's plenty big enough then .
he's very good . 
um , but , um , before that i would use , uh , kids from our church , 
and they did a good job ,
um , but i've never had to leave them like in a day care center ,
and i've been very lucky just be able to stay home . 
that's the way with me . 
i worked four years one time , 
but my last two children were , uh , both entering high school age . 
and , uh , they were , of course , gone while i was working 
so it wasn't a problem i saw , 
and i stayed home the rest of the time . 
so i didn't have that problem either . 
now i , 
my oldest daughter she has two children 
and they've been in day care , uh , 
she works full time . 
that's hard . 
it's difficult 
but yet she's the type of person that , i don't know , if she'd be happy staying at home . 
well , some people aren't . 
she surprised me though . 
she's done a lot of things that i never thought she would do , you know , the one that said she was never getting married and never going to have any children . 
 so , with the children . 
i think that's really important . 
and , uh , they've used the day care most of the time . 
they tried one once . 
they had a lady come in . 
and , uh , she also had a small child she brought with her . 
and it did not work out . uh , at all .
she thought it was going to . 
she was real excited because it was so much easier than taking the children out ,
but , uh , the lady called 
and her baby wasn't very old at the time and said she was having trouble . 
and this baby uh , real pleasant baby easy to satisfy usually . 
and she was having problems with her , 
and so she called and said things were okay , settled down and was all right . 
well , my daughter decided to call them and check 
and things weren't okay .
her one son was watching the soapies 
which she doesn't allow them to watch the soapies . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and the baby was in his crib with the door shut just screaming his heart out , 
oh , dear . 
and the babysitter was in the kitchen with her baby . 
and so that ended that ,
and she was most upset , uh , over finding this . 
i bet . 
so , uh , they kind of had decided that the day care was better . 
there's , uh , 
more than one adult they , 
and the age groups are separated .
well , nannies have been an option , uh , 
but i know that at day care they have more of maybe in , uh , 
story time , uh , 
and this one has been particularly nice . 
uh , it kept track of what they did , 
and they would tell the parents what they did that day . 
you know , if they said anything or did anything . 
so it kind of kept them , 
gave you an idea of what your child ,
would be good to get references ,
because they wouldn't have nothing to worry about saying , you know , 
if there was a problem they would i think be more ready to tell you what it was . 
oh , i think so , because if they were still there , you know they might not , 
they may not say anything . 
and , uh , how do you judge other than from what others have , uh , what you see , uh , the cleanliness and that type of thing . 
you can't really . 
you can't really unless your child would be old enough to say something , 
and usually they aren't at that age . 
 but  it would be real difficult you know , to find one and 
well , i know i tended some children .
or whether they'd just bring them 
and so , 
and then if there was a problem 
and then we'd sit down ,
but it never happened ,
and so things worked out okay , 
and their kids played with my kids 
and it worked out well . 
it worked out good . 
i've decided i'm going to babysit my two granddaughters . 
 since they'll  be going back at the end of the month . 
and so , 
that's great . 
i sell avon and stanley products , 
oh , uhhuh . 
and i've got that worked out . 
my husband , he's retired 
so he's going to deliver my products 
so i'll do my orders and that by phone . 
well , that will be great . 
so , um , 
but i th , 
i bet you'll have some great experiences with them . 
i think i'll enjoy . 
i guess i kind of miss having a baby around .
why not . 
that's right .
well , they do say you enjoy them more , 
somebody said if they knew grandchildren where so much fun , they would have had them first .
well , uh , my husband's mother lives right over here , 
and she takes care of them sometimes ,
and just is a lovely lady , 
and i've always appreciated when she's sat with them . 
my daughter ,
but the ones that complain a lot are the first 
i know they have a waiting list and a quota on immigration now . 
i've lost track . 
i don't really know . 
i do have some opinions , 
but go ahead . 
um , well i know that they're real cautious about letting middle eastern people into the country now because of all the terrorism . 
i hadn't thought about that , uh . 
uh , well i just have an opinion , 
now i thought the terrorism thing was overstated , i mean , 
there was nothing over here . 
in fact even , 
my wife when she talked about the middle east 
and everyone's afraid , you know , of how the war was going to go and everything , 
it's just not going to happen . 
there's not going to be any terrorism over him , 
and there wasn't , you know . 
they just didn't have an organization , 
but , uh , that we don't have enough controls . 
i think that , uh , the asian gangsters that we've let in here 
uh , and the last , you know , 
out of all the asians we brought in , there's a tremendous criminal element that we let in from asia 
and i think that 
that's right . 
i mean this asia mafia thing is getting out of hand . 
i don't even know what our controls are . 
i don't even know what , uh , if we have any guidelines at all , uh , on immigration . 
um , i always thought that we did , 
but i don't know what they are right now . 
much of one , because i'm sure all the people from cuba have been released from that camp that they were in . 
and , uh , it's just like australia , most of them were criminals from cuba 
 and i think that was just an attempt that fidel castro to undermine , you know 
so he just released and got rid of all his criminals and sent them to us . 
and it's almost the same thing uh , from asia , because 
because we , 
i do have some sympathy with , uh , you know , 
of course we have this big mexican problem , 
not a problem , 
but i think that we need to do something with , uh , the immigration of back and forth across mexico , uh 
i'm sympathetic , 
i don't know what the answer is , i guess . 
i'm sympathetic certainly with that , that they want to come over here 
and i guess hundreds of thousands come over every year to work . 
and if they have jobs , you know , i hear the story that they're taking away american jobs . 
but i don't know , uh , 
i don't know how many american jobs they are really taking away . 
so i'm sympathetic , 
but i don't have an answer . 
i don't 
but that's not really exactly immigration . 
it is 
and it isn't . 
i don't know to what degree we owe the people who come across before they're citizens , 
owe the children education and all that , uh , 
although , the idea of education is an answer to a lot of problems in the world . 
the mexican kids get a good education along the way , 
and maybe that's a benefit to everybody , you know . 
and a lot of the mexican people just cross the border during the daytime to come over here and work 
 and they have green cards . 
uh , then , like you said , a lot of , 
i run into people every day that can't speak english . 
oh , yeah . 
and most of them , you know , are working in janitorial positions 
 and that , 
like you said , i don't know how much they're taking from the work force , you know . 
i never thought that they were much . 
i do cringe when i hear some of the problems we've had . 
um , uh , of course you mentioned the language . 
i feel so bad that we , here in texas , or certainly the southern part of the united states , uh , california , texas , and all that , why our kids don't speak fluid spanish , uh , by junior high , you know 
so that we wouldn't have the language barrier certainly . 
that is a shame that we have this tremendous border of mexico , 
and then , in europe , you know , they speak their french and all 
and they go out of their way to try to speak their neighbor's language so they can understand . 
we don't really even make an effort 
and i feel bad about that .
go ahead . 
well , that's , 
i took spanish in school , 
and that's , you know , one reason that i did it 
i guess it's never too late . 
i do have some spanish books , 
and i've always , uh , 
every year i say i'm going to try to speak some newcomers language , you know . 
i don't know if it's costing us any money 
or how much money they're putting into it , uh , 
that's always a factor , 
i mean my wife says , how much the federal government is putting into it 
well , it's basically on the , well , 
i think it's mostly concentrated toward the borders , 
and , uh , it's more , um , 
the immigration is tied in with , uh , drug trafficking . 
so they have to watch out who comes in , 
you know , on the most , um , innocent looking kind of 
i forgot what they found , 
but a dog found it the other day , you know 
oh , yeah . 
oh yeah , 
i think that certainly is a problem . 
but that is , i mean , 
on ellis island , they , 
you know they're redoing that and going to make it a national museum . 
that certainly was interesting , 
since all of us had , uh , ancestors that came over that way . 
or not all , 
but i guess if you go back far enough you came over on a boat originally , you know . 
but , uh , a lot of us have grandparents , 
my grandparents came over in about eighteen ninety or something like that . 
and i'm sure they came over , you know , through ellis island , you know . 
that's right . 
well . *[[slash error
so we all immigrants , one way or another , well 
we certainly are , coming from europe . 
and one of the things that really gets to me , uh , about the mexicans is that , um , once they have children over here , their children are american citizens then . 
oh , yeah , 
those were laws are unusual . 
and then they'll ship the parents back 
and that leaves the children without any parents . 
so that doesn't seem fair to the children . 
sometimes common sense should take over rather than , 
that's a law doesn't sound like it makes any sense at all 
you would think they could at least get a visa or something until they , uh , get citizenship . 
i'm sure they want to . 
and then they granted them amnesty when was that , it was in the eighties some time 
oh , yeah . 
i heard something about that , yeah . 
and , uh , a lot of them had been , you know . 
some of them moved back and forth , 
 oh no . 
oh , no , 
you could see why . 
i don't know how much immigration we have from europe and everything . 
what the controls are . 
i think most , you know , like especially the celebrities and everything , uh , well , they have to get a green card if they going to do any kind of work , you know , in movies 
but most of them have temporary visas . 
i guess you can get work visas pretty easily , uh . 
as long , it's like well , 
it's a kind of bad example , 
but when rafael septien took the job with the cowboys 
oh , really ? 
so that , you know , 
and that's the thing with the jobs . 
and of course no one beat him out . 
so , you know . he just ruined his own career , 
oh , well yeah . 
well it's still interesting after all this time that we're probably one of the few countries that people are still desperately trying to immigrate to . 
uh , although i guess europe , now that the communism is falling apart , that maybe there'll countries , uh , 
i guess poland now is noncommunist 
maybe immigration from europe to here will you know slowly , uh , change , 
maybe it'll even out like trade , you know . 
so many people will immigrate here at the year two thousand , 
so many of the people will go back overseas . 
you know , maybe it will average out , 
i don't know . 
i think so . 
it doesn't seem so far . 
because there are other uh , job opportunities ,
like orchestra players can find a job sometimes in europe when they can't find one here . 
and i'm a trumpet player . 
are you a teacher ? 
uh , no , 
i just went to school 
and i was a music major for a while . 
oh , really , 
but i had a trumpet teacher that played in the mexico city symphony . 
and of course they had a lot of musicians from other countries 
but i think , um , like three out of the four other people in the trumpet section are from mexico now . 
oh , really . 
but i think is from another country . 
it's like any other symphony . 
you know , and eduardo mana's from mexico 
so he had to , 
well , um , i haven't really lived in a lot of big cities . 
i mean , i'm living in dallas now . 
plano is outside of dallas , 
um , so i don't really have a lot of experience with air pollution . 
but , i know when i lived down in houston , on the outskirts of houston , there were some towns like pasadena that had oil refineries , 
and , um , if you would drive by there , like on your way to the beach or something ,
and it always smelled really bad . 
we know that , that was really , really , really bad for the atmosphere . 
what have you got up there ? 
well , i live out in the country , 
so that part is good . 
uh , we're maybe one hundred miles from pittsburgh , 
which has a lot of pollution from their plants , 
and right now in our area were fighting against a toxic waste incinerator . *[[sp: we're
oh , no . 
and , uh , it won't be too for from where we live . *[[sp: far
and everybody really has been , you know , fighting against it , because we do not want it . 
well , we don't want one any place  , 
we would like the , uh , industry to do more to take care of the waste products before they turn to incineration , because we feel that , uh , the small percentage that they're going to be putting into the air is too much . 
i mean , it's just so bad that there is just so much going into the air 
plus all the problems in the middle east . 
with all that smoke and , 
oh , that has to be terrible over there . 
so it's just , um , why are we doing this to ourselves .
i just don't know , 
but , um , you know , what really amazes me about , like that pasadena area and the oil refineries ,
i mean , between the freeway and the oil refinery , you would see a neighborhood . 
and what comes up , must come down .
we're breathing it all the time . 
and how , if they have all of those , um , 
toxicity , i mean , there's signs around saying how dangerous it is 
and here you are living  . . . 
that just doesn't make too much sense . 
and i figure we're paying to take care of this toxic waste , no matter who does it . 
uh , they've reused some of it , uh , 
it can be recycled , a lot of their things , 
and that they've shown , that uh , to begin with , apparently it does cost more , 
but , once they get started , it saves them money in the end , 
and it cuts down on the end product that has to be dealt with some other way . 
and if they would all , 
that's what we want done . 
we want industry to take , you know , more responsibility in taking care of it . 
well , um , individual companies and things are so selfish , 
and their desires to save a few dollars and that 
they don't care about the environmental impact ,
they're greedy . 
it's money , is what is . 
it's the money 
they're making fantastic amounts on these things 
and , uh , even the incinerator , the money and the income that they're going to make off this , is , you know , just astronomical . 
well , have you ever visited , um , like los angeles or any place it's kind of known , that it has , uh , pollution in it's air ? 
we went as far as , uh , like las vegas ,
we should have gone the whole way over , 
but we didn't . 
but , i understand that , 
we have an aunt that lives out there 
and she said how wonderful it was to be able to look into the sky and see some of the things that she saw . 
she said they couldn't see those things out there ,
that's so awful . 
well , what about in new york . 
i guess you've gone that way , maybe . 
i don't want to go there .
pretty funny . 
have you been there ? 
i have relatives that direction . 
we have , 
it's , um , 
is it close to phoenixville , pennsylvania ? 
um , no , 
because i have family there 
we're near pittsburgh , clarion university . 
oh , huhuh . 
it's pretty neat . 
it's kind of northwest part of pennsylvania . 
that's beautiful country up that way . 
i know , 
it's , um , very lush and pretty ,
it's really , 
are you a young person ? 
well , i'm thirtyone . 
thirtyone . 
you're young .
seems kind of old to me . 
you have a lot of life yet , 
and these , 
uh , older people , 
or they think they're far enough away from something ,
and they don't realize these things are going to affect everybody . 
and if you're older it's not going to affect you that way . 
you have grandchildren , 
you have children , uh , 
nieces , nephews , whatever , friends . 
uh , everybody is going to be affected by it . 
that's really true . 
and we all , you know , need to be willing to help pay a little bit . like , 
i've heard some people , uh , grumble about their , uh , cars passing their emission tests ,
and how it's more expensive and things . 
and i thought , well , it's so much better . 
they say it has really made a difference , though . 
now , see , we don't have that here , yet . 
oh , you don't . 
but they , 
i have read where the population is greater , 
and that it has made a difference . 
well , i really think it must . 
i think every , 
i mean , well , think about how many automobiles there are . 
and each is putting out , 
like we have a car , 
one of our cars is an older car , 
and every time you start it , from the tail pipe , it makes a black spot ,
and you know that is a sign . 
something is coming out , 
 and all cars are doing that . 
and it's really polluting the air . 
if you have to put a price on it . which is more valuable , life or paying a little more . 
and it's causing of lot of the real terrible suffering like cancer ,
we sure wouldn't want ,
and like i said , i think you have to pay for it no matter what you do you with it , because it's industry . 
we're paying industry to make the products 
then , we have to pay for them to pay somebody to carry it away someplace , 
then they put it in the dump some place 
and they find out , well , this dump doesn't work 
so we have to clean this up and move it someplace else . 
we end up paying for it again . 
now we're going to end up paying for it again by having it burned in these large incinerators . 
and we're paying to have our air polluted and our water streams polluted . 
pretty sad . 
or the , 
the two water  sheds  that feed clarion river . 
oh , no . 
and , you know , it just boggles our mind that they can consider even putting it there , because ,
it will , you know , 
it affects so many people . 
and it's just hard to think that they could allow them to do things like this . 
it's scary .
it's scary . 
it really is . 
it's really awful . 
well , i've really enjoyed the conversation . 
it's helped me to think more about some issues that i need to be thinking more about .
it is really a concern . 
and instead of waiting until it directly affects me , like you say ,
well , you have a good day . 
well , you , too . 
thank you . 
one is , uh , two 
and the other one's four 
and , uh , this is my first year of staying home . 
i've always had them in child care . 
oh , well , then you are familiar with it ? 
uh , i have grandchildren 
and i know , uh , well , two of them have gone to preschool . 
and i know what the experience my daughter has faced with that . 
why don't you tell me what you have found . 
well , uh , the , 
with our second sitter , the first one didn't quite work out , there were some things going on that i wasn't really happy with 
and so i felt that i need to move on with them 
and so i found another babysitter 
and she was wonderful 
except i thought that there were too many in the home 
and it just seemed like it was so hard to find , uh , really good child care . 
she was wonderful , 
it's just that i felt that there were too many in the home . 
it was 
so it was in home child care . 
you took them to someone's home ? 
well , both times ? 
in the child care centers 
and i wasn't really happy with the particular one that i was working in 
so i just always had a fear about , you know , child care centers . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and then i just decided that i was just missing a lot of their time whether they were so little 
and i couldn't get off of work as often as i wanted to when they were ill 
so i just decided it was probably best just to stay home for a while until they were a little more , uh , independent 
and , uh , i could go back to work . 
i know that in raising my children , uh , i was fortunate , 
i didn't have to work , 
we didn't necessarily have a lot of things  , 
that's how it's going now . 
uh , and , i know my daughter , 
because she has three 
i mean it's so expensive . 
oh , yeah . 
you have to really make a lot of money . 
and i'm glad that she gets to stay home so that she can then participate with what's going on in their life . 
uh , bosses don't always seem to understand getting off to go to christmas programs in the middle of the day or something . 
oh , no , 
you know , and i know that one of the day cares and it's a wellknown chain , uh , she was not at all happy with . 
there was too many children per person . 
they were just kind of left to play , 
there was no structure to , 
and the middle grandson went there as uh , like a preschool thing . 
she was wanting him actually to start getting a certain amount of learning and training and stuff . 
not just there , you know , 
so like , uh , i think he went , well , five mornings a week , if i remember correctly . 
uh , you know , and it was supposed to be a base , 
you know , starting to learn the colors and learning to associate with children 
and , uh , she was most unhappy with it . 
there was no structure , 
there was nothing to it . 
you know , and , uh , she pulled him out of that one and put him in a , another one that was excellent . 
it was like a little kindergarten . 
and , uh , they had hot lunches 
and they had classes that , you know , one class they'd do art . 
they even familiarized the children with computers . 
uh , it was really a very excellent 
and how old was he ? 
he's now five and a half . 
he's in kindergarten . 
this was last year . 
and the first one , uh , he went to a , uh , church preschool 
the methodist church in richardson . 
the big one 
and it was a excellent , 
very good . 
my little boy goes to the methodist , uh , in garland . 
oh , does he ? 
i'm real happy with that one . 
church ones seem to be very well run . 
well , i've heard that the methodist ones are excellent . 
oh , really ? 
 , even the mother's day out programs , i heard , are real good . 
oh . uh , i just assumed that most churches , going by , you know 
i'm not that familiar . 
i just know that , you know , first united methodist of richardson was 
because this is first united methodist in garland 
and i'm real happy with that . 
well , that's a , 
uh , i taught for richardson school district 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and , uh , i taught early childhood 
and i really enjoyed it , 
but it was taking a lot of my time 
and i noticed i was spending less and less time with them 
and it just seemed like they were sick more often 
 and i just couldn't get the time off to , 
well , isn't it very hard to teach young children and then come home and deal 
it really is . 
and i felt , 
could you tell me what you think contributes most to , uh , air pollution ? 
well , it's hard to say . 
i mean , while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories , uh , pollute a lot , uh , if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano , uh , it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all . 
what do you think ? 
um , well , you talked about , uh , volcanos . 
i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now , and what the amount of material that they do , uh , put into the atmosphere . 
i think probably the greatest cause is , uh , vehicles ,
um , uh , do you live right in the city itself ? 
but i certainly work near a city . 
so ca , 
how about you ? 
well it's , 
i live in a rural area . 
it's mainly farms and , uh , no heavy industry . 
attleboro , itself , 
i live in rhode island . 
oh , i see . 
and , it's in the north , 
i live up in the , uh , northeast corner 
and attleboro sits in just over the line ,
but there isn't a lot of heavy industry . 
there's the freeways 
and we get an occasional , 
it depends which way the wind's blowing from boston , cause we're like forty miles south of boston , 
so we'll pick up that . 
and , uh , i've noticed over the past say , maybe five or six years , uh , 
we live about twenty miles away from the state airport 
and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger , 
they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over our homes . 
and , it seems like , uh , we're catching all that residue . 
i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping . 
but , other than that , you know , we don't have unless we're catching it from the midwest , the emissions .
you mean like from the coal . 
one of our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to , uh , 
um , there doesn't seem to be much emission from them , 
but i'm not sure about the rest of the country . 
i notice locally a major problem is kodak . 
um , it's interesting 
because in order to , uh , keep with the e p a standards which tend to be visible , uh , what's coming out of your smokestack , they do all their emissions at night . 
uh , so people get up , 
well , is that right ? .
and they've got this black ash on their cars ,
surprise , surprise . 
i mean , i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades , light up the sky , photograph the emissions at that point , and , uh , you know , 
uh , up around one hundred twentyeight . 
um , we've got reports that , uh , 
during the night seems like they'd blow off their stacks from , uh , 
and , they do that at night too , because ,
so , you're right , 
they could do something about that , i guess . 
that seems a little ridiculous . 
how are uh , your lakes , 
and , uh , 
oh they've been getting cleaner . 
they have ? 
but , um , yeah , 
i'm not sure how much the water pollution is directly related to the air pollution , other than acid rain , 
acid rain , 
that's what i was , uh , 
i mean the stuff i've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit , uh , overstated . that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all . 
um , ye , 
i'm not an expert . 
didn't they just have an article , oh , on , uh , 
they were dumping lime . 
up here ? 
upstate new york somewhere ,
i haven't read that . 
oh yeah . 
and they thought that was more beneficial because , you know some of it does soak in 
and some of it runs off right away in to the streams and rivers 
and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback . 
i can't remember where 
i read that recently somewhere , 
and i can't remember where . 
that's interesti , 
but i thought it was up there . 
so , that's interesting because new hampshire ,
um , you kind of think it's something else then ? 
so that , 
oh , they didn't say what though , 
they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected . um , that it may be other natural things at work . um , 
uh , natural disease , 
so it's less than clear . 
like i said , i don't remember the article that well . 
but , um , i don't know , 
i mean , what do you think we can , uh , i guess as individuals or as a group , do about , uh , air pollution ? .
uh , we can demand , uh , more efficient automobiles for one thing . 
i still think that's , uh , one of our major causes of pollutants . 
uh , how we go about that , uh , uh , it's a little bit difficult . 
i think it's up to individuals too , to ask automakers for , 
a vehicle something like , uh , ralph nader , nader's raiders , or , 
do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem . 
i mean , i remember reading an article that said like , it's , uh , the older polluters , 
the twelve and fifteen year old cars , you know , contribute like ninety percent ,
and the new cars is , hardly anything . 
they're better , 
but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there . 
uh , when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch , smoke , or , uh , 
but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune . 
uh , i'm not really sure . 
you think industry is that , uh , incompetent , that they wouldn't , you know , 
fuel is one of their biggest costs . 
so , you would , 
but diesel engines . 
i mean , they do generate a lot of soot 
but at least , that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly . 
we could also , uh , push for legislation for , uh , rapid transit systems . 
this country seems to be a little behind on that . 
on the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient . 
um , yeah , 
but only because we got used to , uh , single person , single car ,
a lot of people don't even like to carpool . 
but we could that . 
that'll help ,
the , uh , united states and canada is , going into , uh , some types of agreements to limit , uh , what's being given out by power plants , 
i guess canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there , 
so that's helping . 
well , what do you think about like a device , a meter right on a tail pipe 
now that's an idea . 
don't say that too loud though because , uh , every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating revenue , 
 well , it just means if you don't pollute , right , or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax 
or you just buy one of these things 
and it , uh , 
maybe you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe 
and , uh , the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts 
and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe 
and you couldn't start your car anymore . 
that's an interesting concept . 
is that your idea ? 
but , uh , you know , it's , uh , 
i guess the difficulty would be that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again 
so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something . 
 well i was going to say , 
it could be installed like a catalytic converter . 
i mean i guess you could take those off too 
you could take ca , 
but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off . 
if you can take a muffler off and only replace , 
well not unless it was built into every muffler . 
and that's   .
but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that , uh , busses and any kind of vehicle ,
that's quite a concept . 
you should , uh , pursue that i think , or patent it , you know . 
that's a good idea . 
if you could come up with a device that's the thing . 
but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that . 
but that's a thought . 
you're right 
and that will solve , uh , a lot of problems . 
i don't know uh , if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that . 
uh , but you know a proposal to , uh , uh , i guess the proper authorities , 
well you might , uh , generate some 
the automobile regulatory agencies or something . 
but that's a good idea . 
other than that i'm not sure what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization . 
what are your music interests ? 
uh , just about any kind of music except acid rock  , 
i don't care ,
me , too . 
but , uh , i grew up with country and western , 
i did , too , 
but , uh , 
and then , 
just about any kind of music . 
i even like classical music . 
uh , i'm pretty diversified , too . 
i don't like acid rock either . 
i grew up in a small town 
so , uh , we only had one radio station 
so it was country music , 
but then , uh , when i , 
i grew up with hank snow , and  lefty frizzell  and hank williams and all of those old country and western songs . 
 oh , really . 
you're older than i am .
 but , uh , i , 
did you happen to see last night the special on channel two with james galway ? 
i wish we got that what , 
that is fabulous . 
was it ? 
oh , really ? 
now , he is a , uh , 
actually , i did , 
i played flute for ,
i appreciate his too ,
was i , 
they had a band with him that , uh , had a harpist and another flute and then a guy that played the bagpipes plus the , uh , tin whistle ,
and they played all the irish jigs and so forth , 
it was just fabulous . 
he is really good . 
i come from a musical background , 
so , uh , uh , i've played flute and piano , 
i'm getting now to the age where i don't like the new stuff that's coming an , 
my husband says i'm getting old .
i especially like instrumentals . 
do you ? 
i love to just lay back on the couch good instrumental on and just close my eyes and listen . 
that's nice to do , that is . 
i've got a two year old who's now getting , 
i'm getting well versed in kiddy music .
i've never played an instrument in my life , 
i've always wanted too , 
i've always wished my parents had forced me to learn the piano or something , 
but , uh , 
i was one of the forced ones .
 but i'd just love to be able to go to a party or something and sit down at the piano and bang out music 
oh , i could never do that .
i was never that brave 
but , uh , yeah . 
i guess the closest i've ever come to participating in music is singing in the choir . 
i've done that at church too . 
i haven't done that in a long time . 
so , let's see 
 what els ,  .
well , what kind of music do you not like ? 
well , like i say the acid rock , 
i just do not ca , 
an i don't care for rap music either . 
oh , go , 
that's not music  , 
that is not , 
i don't know what that is , 
but that's not music .
if i can't understand the words i don't want to listen to it . 
well , it's not music , 
it's just , uh , uh , talking in a beat , 
it is just , 
it doesn't , 
you can't dance to it , 
you can't do anything to it .
have you ever been to the dallas symphony ? 
have you ? 
is i , 
are they ? 
i have , 
and , uh , 
oh , really ? 
 oh , the music in that was fantastic . 
i've heard that that is a really , 
i heard that was hard to get tickets to . 
it , uh , 
i can't remember how far in advance we reserved ,
but it was you know , out at the state fair music hall 
and , uh 
that was a real , 
was it ? 
i bet it was , 
is that the only , uh , musical , 
do you go see a lot of musicals ? 
just ever so often 
that would be nice .
i went and saw , uh , i think it was , uh , sugar babies , 
that was good , 
that had good music in it . 
was it ? 
i don't know what that's about . 
uh , that was the one with mickey rooney 
and , uh , oh , what's that oh , not real old , my wife she is old too , 
i can't think of her name . 
i got it right on the tip of my tongue and can't say it , helen something . 
uh , uh , uh , oh , i know who you're talking about , 
real long legs ,
she's got black hair , 
i know who your talking about . 
i can't think ever her name either . 
i can't think of it . 
that was , 
i remember that being , uh , here a few years ago . 
but , uh , 
oh , oh , the last country music , 
my parents still , uh , really like country ,
and uh , they like the oak ridge boys and the statler brothers , 
oh , yeah , 
the blackwoods . 
my husband likes , uh , country music real well 
and he likes some of the new groups like shenandoah , 
and , yeah , 
he really likes shenandoah . 
i think they're a bit over exposed .
i get kind ,
either alabama or hank williams , junior . 
oh , i've never cared for hank ,
i never have either , 
and i never have figured out how he won , uh , entertainer of the year for about ,
oh , we watch those award shows too , 
we enjoy watching the country and the grammies and stuff 
but i just don't care for him , 
i just never have . 
i don't , 
i guess probably my favorite all time country and western song or singer is , uh , probably eddy arnold . 
is it ? 
i know who that is , 
i think my parents have , uh , some of his records . 
but , uh , 
smiley burnette , i don't know if you were old enough to remember him . 
i've heard the name . 
he uh , played in the old western movies . 
he was the sidekick of gene autry i believe 
 or they , 
i think his name in the movie was froggy 
i've never seen a gene autry movie , 
had a real raspy voice , 
and , uh , 
i never have .
some of those old ones , of course , bob wills , miss texas playboys 
those go back quite a way .
i took them up here to collectors records and was able to get a little money for them 
 but , uh , 
it's hard to , 
oh , yeah . 
and uh , they had a , uh , nickelodeon , of course , in the restaurant , 
and when they would come and change the records the guy would give her the old records 
well , that wou , 
that's neat . 
 so , that's where i got my , 
that would be great if they weren't too worn out ,
of course , there's not a whole lot of market for seventyeight r p m records . 
is there not ? 
well you'd think there would be . 
well , the problem is most of the record players now will not play them because ,
well , that's true . 
oh , yeah . 
 and , uh , they ,
well , that's a shame 
 because we go to antique stores a lot 
and you see seventyeights ,
i'm sure you could find old players for them 
but that would cost a fortune ,
of course , they , you know , just don't have the quality of records nowadays either because ,
you could kill somebody with them .
warped real easy . 
and the ones you buy , 
go out and buy one now 
and they're just so thin and ,
and they're not meant to last ,
neither are tapes . 
we buy cassette tapes , 
and machines will eat them , 
and so , the best bet , these days are compact disk , 
those things are practically indestructible .
but , i guess , you know , the old country and western music you , 
back then when i was a kid , there wasn't that much t v , 
oh , no . 
so that's all you had to listen to was the ,
and , uh , 
just what you had , 
i think it was better back then to , 
there's too much t v now 
 and the radio is , you know , more exciting ,
your imagination 
i , kept 
and yo , 
it just didn't vegetate your mind like television does .
i remember mother and dad always turned on the grand ole opera . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah . 
was it on the radio every week ? 
what day was that on , 
can you recall . 
uh , uh , seems like it was on a friday , 
friday or , 
okay . 
well what do you think about the idea of , uh , kids having to do public service work for a year ? 
do you think it's a  , 
well , i think it's a pretty good idea . 
i think they should either do that , or helping elderly people . 
you know , i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help 
and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home 
that's true . 
or the military for a year or two ,
i think it teaches kids how to grow . 
how about yourself ? 
uh , i agree with you . 
uh , uh , what i'm thinking about is back  , well , when i was a kid , and much earlier than that , kids were kind of , i , 
you know , the parents kind of pushed them to join , like the boy scouts or girl scouts 
and they did , do a lot of public service activities , 
but these days they're not , uh , 
parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that . 
because when i was in the girl scouts , we did a lot of public service things , because that's just part of the scouting , and , you know . 
that's really great . 
two excellent organizations . 
they are 
but parents , 
you know , kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that , 
they do . 
and they don't follow it at all , you know . 
there are very few scouts go on ,
oh , no . 
and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals 
i , uh , 
senior , 
so , there's not , uh , 
oh , they're just not , 
once they get into junior high it just ,
they lose interest . 
and then when they young adults ,
they're more for , i g , 
walk out .
you're absolutely right .
i think it's a really a good thing . 
i like to see , 
of course , there's , you know , third world countries that can use all kind of help .
but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country ,
but i think ,
i'm , you know , 
uh , people . 
but , since there is much that needs to be done here . 
yeah , i think that we need to really address what we've done here 
and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook . 
well , it's been really good . 
we talked about this for a few minutes , 
but i don't really have too much more to say on this topic , i guess . 
i agree with you .
i guess we both agree that it's a good thing ,
well you take care , 
you , too . 
you , too . 
thank you , ma'am . 
regular exercise program right now ? 
how about you ? 
oh , well , i'm kind of off and on . 
off and on 
well , i guess i've been kind of off and on 
i've , uh , 
right now i'm kind of off . 
i'd say more on than off .
what type of exercise do you do ? 
uh , i do walking on the treadmill , 
and then i do low impact aerobics . 
i guess you don't enjoy that very much . 
do you find that , uh , to be boring ? 
i mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming , 
it's , uh , you know , afterwards , you know , 
then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up , you know . 
well , i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring . 
oh , yeah . 
but i , 
is this something that you go through every year .
i just bought myself a solo flex machine , 
i don't know if you've seen those advertised on t v . 
it's one of those , uh , universal type exercise machines . 
but i haven't really sat down and used it match yet , 
so it's collecting dust right now . 
a lot of things do that . 
i had an , 
i used to jog somewhat . 
i use to have one , 
and i finally got rid of sit cause i never used it , 
but i do use my treadmill .
well , that's good . 
my parents have a treadmill 
when i go visit them , uh , i get on that thing every now and then . 
it's nice because when the weather's bad you don't have any excuse . 
i just got the bicycle out today , 
and it was real nice outside , 
had to get out to do something . 
i can't ride a bike 
i've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold 
so thought i ,
it's too nice , 
it's been too nice all weekend . 
but , uh , yeah , 
i need to start something again . 
i've always of that to be , uh , really one of the best forms of exercise , 
but it's terribly boring , 
and so i really don't ever keep a program up consistently . 
have you ever had any injuries from jogging ? 
well , i don't job enough i think to develop any injuries 
i usually only go about a mile or two . 
i guess it worries me about jogging and that , you know , you can end up getting hurt ,
it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete ,
suppose to be much better if you find grass , uh , or dirt to jog on . 
that's not quite  ,
you have to have the right ,
i found that ,
i don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often 
my don't get very much use .
 well , i guess my breakdown they say about every six months . 
i usually enjoy the exercise i do 
but , uh , like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a program . 
so i'll bicycle 
i get into that for a little while and maybe go out , uh , on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile , 
but then i'll get tired of doing that ,
but , uh , that gets old too in a very short order , 
i'm hoping that this , uh , solo flex will , uh , uh , change things a little bit , 
i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis . 
well , don't let it collect dust . 
at least exercise while dusting it off .
maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this string i can , uh , start some type of , uh , regular program . 
that'll be good . 
i've always found that , uh , when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to uh , keep something going . 
uh , when i was in high school we had a choice of , uh , taking , uh , physical education courses on exercise , 
an , uh , one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine , lifting weights and ,
and that was very helpful 
we kept charts of our progress ,
i found that to be , uh , very helpful . 
are you going to do that ? 
uh , i need to , 
i haven't started yet 
but , uh , it's a thought . 
well , that sounds like something good to do then . 
sounds like something i should do . 
nice way to start off this spring .
how often do you , uh , uh , go out each week on your walking ? 
well , i do , 
i switch every other day 
one day i walk 
and one day i do the aerobics . 
about how far do you go walking ? 
 well , i'm trying to get my tolerance now 
i just had surgery , um , less then two months ago , 
and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half , 
but i'm trying to workup to three miles . 
well , that's good . 
well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging . 
it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect . 
well , if you keep up with a consistent pace just to , uh , keep the heart rating going , uh , 
my walkman broke , 
so i'm upset  , 
and i just have to turn to stereo up real loud .
but it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is . 
it is 
and this doesn't , you know , 
my treadmill has an incline 
and , you know , you can get a really good workout on it . 
um , do you go to an aerobics class 
or do you watch ,
i have a cassette . 
which , uh , shows do you watch on t v ? 
um , it's a tap , 
i use tapes . 
oh , okay , 
like a cathy smith workout , 
or richard simmons , 
or jane fonda . 
sweating to the oldies .
every now and then i'll watch e s p n , 
i get cable on t v , 
and they have , uh , a couple of shows called basic training , 
and , uh , what is the other one called . 
there was one guy i use to watch on e s p n , 
i don't know if he's still on any more or not , 
i don't know if i get e s p n or not .
but , uh , one , you know , 
i use to watch one on the air , 
but that was back , 
bodies in motion that's the name of the one i was thinking of .
that's was , 
i watched that cause he was cute .
his assistants usually aren't either . 
but , uh , 
they're always in hawaii some place .
but then that was back when , uh , you know , the high impact and , 
well , they do low i pact stuff now , 
do they . 
are the , 
he's still doing it then , uh . 
i'll have to tune in . 
it's on e s p n , uh , 
at what time , 
i can't remember what time . 
it's , uh , you know , 
i can't remember offhand what time . 
i'll have to check , 
but the thing is everybody always looks so good on that show , at least on   .
every now and then . 
not everybody has a picture perfect body . 
well , i found that they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on t v . 
i haven't watch any other ones on t v . 
they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day .
now , that's a thought . 
so i'm kind of bad about that myself . 
well , that's thought , 
i haven't thought about that , 
well , i sure enjoyed ,
nice talking to you too . 
so , all right . 
talk to you later . 
good night . 
 uh , well what would you say your opinion is on gun control ? 
well , i don't know . 
and watch t v about the different , uh , things that are happening . 
uh , i'm against it 
but on the same token , uh , i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that .
 so i have a rifle in the house . 
uh , the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it . 
but , uh , i bought it for target practicing uh , and also because i wanted a weapon . 
uh , how do you feel about it ? 
well , i think , uh , down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns . 
and , i think they need that . 
uh , and i have a pistol . 
it's a little twentytwo 
and i have a twentytwo or a twelve gauge shotgun . 
an , you know , i do like to have my guns . 
 uh , i don't know if i'll ever use it , you know . 
and like you , my bullets to my little pistol's probably , uh , about three years old .
uh , my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two . 
well , ammunition . 
and i thought that was really good . 
and i think if they , uh , 
takes two weeks for that system to process , uh , your request uh , but to buy ammunition . 
you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that . 
i've never heard of anything like that . 
yeah . uh , 
that would be nice . 
the criminals that are going to get their guns one 
i think , you know , one of the things and , uh , 
but if someone's really determined to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place . 
 and you can get them really cheap . 
i know 
i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in , uh , tennessee .
and , uh , we bought it there . 
how long was the waiting period out there ? 
about nine days . 
that wasn't too bad . 
because you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it . 
you're not going to react that quickly . 
in other words , you know , you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day . 
somebody wants to do that , 
at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms . 
i do too . uh , because it doesn't make any difference , uh , uh , whether it's a pistol or a shotgun , i suppose . 
they both do the same kind of job . 
 a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does . 
i never got shot with either one . 
but i don't know , uh , 
i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun .
a shotgun's got too much of a spread . 
 or at 
uh , it's , you know , 
you have a little , uh , thing on top of the barrel 
you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get . 
and the spread changes . 
uh , i've got a manual single shot 
and i guess it doesn't have any automatic features to it . 
the further away i get , the , uh , wider the shot gets 
and the closer that i get , the tighter that it gets . 
it's got a hell of a kick to it . 
my husband had uh , a police gun at one time . 
and i shot that thing one time . 
almost knocked me down . 
 and it just  a li ,  
i forget , 
i think it was a three fiftyseven . 
i'm not sure . 
he belonged to one awhile back . 
uh , since we moved , 
we've only been here in texas for about a year 
 and , uh , we can't even find a place to shoot . just for 
no kidding . 
i'd love to get used to that shotgun . 
we traded his pistol for that shotgun . 
huh . well the , uh , clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive 
but , uh , it's well worth it . 
you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have , uh , competition . 
uh , i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time . not because i haven't got the desire . 
uh , there's an annual membership fee , uh , that's fairly high . 
plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time , uh , uh , member . 
so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club . 
plus you have to pay for the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in . 
well , that's what my husband , 
when he was in that gun club where he was doing that .
it , you know , 
he went mostly just to , uh , shoot at paper targets . 
uh , but , you know , they used speed and accuracy and all that . 
i think that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose . 
in fact , i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to , uh , show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon . 
that's a good , 
i've never thought of that . 
that's a good point . 
and , you know , it , 
even after you wait your nine days , if you don't know how to handle it , it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive . 
and you give him a license because he waited nine days . 
and , yeah . 
he could not only , uh , uh , shoot himself . 
he could , uh , mishandle a weapon . leave it at home and let a child get at it . 
well uh , we was living on a navy base down in memphis 
and , uh , this one guy decided to play , uh , lonesome cowboy or something . 
and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot . 
he was fortunate . 
 well , he went tumbling down the steps along with , uh , shooting his foot almost off . 
he broke his leg and 
i can't remember what the term was going around . 
it was about four or five years ago . 
about , uh , private citizens selling a weapons ? 
like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me . 
how do you feel about that ? 
do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the , uh , buyer and the seller ? 
or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system , uh , 
uh , that's a hard one because we did that . 
but , uh , i think there ought to be some rule against it . 
i'll , uh , you know , 
the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something , the cops are going to come to you . 
i have no idea . 
i've only 
 because i 
and i've kept it , you 
is it registered ? 
uh , the rifle that i've got is not registered , 
and , uh , i don't know why i never registered it 
but the , uh , 
i don't think you have to register a shotgun .
uh , the , 
well , see , uh , my husband has a thing . 
if they go to , uh , citizens 
my kid is jumping on me . 
i can't hardly talk . 
my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns . 
it's just like uh , the social security system .
once uh , they gave everybody a number 
and now they're making you , uh , uh , get one at birth . 
and if you try to do anything , uh , like , uh , not identify yourself to the government , they know who you are . 
and everything about you . 
 and   , that's true .
uh , i , 
bu , you know , they know so , how much money you make a week to , uh , probably your , uh , 
my kid is banging . 
i was seeing what they was banging on . 
uh , i've lost my train of thought . 
i'm sorry .
that's all right . 
you were talking about , uh , uh , 
oh , the soc , 
what time you go to the bathroom . 
 they probably do . 
that's a little bit extreme . 
but they could know anything and everything about you . 
and , uh , i'd like to have my gun . 
if they go to banning them , i'd lose my gun 
but we wouldn't lose our , uh , shotgun . 
and , uh , we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about . 
but i don't , uh  , 
do you find it difficult picking up , uh , guns that are not registered ? 
no . 
i don't either . 
i can buy some , uh , today if i wanted to . 
well , you can look in uh , the , 
we got a thing down here called a shopper . 
it's a bargain thing . 
uh , you go and you know , always see guns in there .
it comes out every tuesday . 
and there's no waiting period on that . 
none whatsoever .
you call , 
we sold a refrigerator through it 
and it took us all of twelve hours . 
to sell the refrigerator ? 
you know . and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun . 
huh . and i think the federal government uh , is really far away from , uh , uh , control . 
i don't believe in , uh , 
i shouldn't probably say control . 
i mean regulation . 
control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have . 
uh , but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons . 
well , i agree with you there . 
they do have too much control over us already . 
uh , we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have . 
unfortunately , the people who spend the money , 
so i can't complain too much . 
i guess so . 
i don't know . 
they're  , 
 well , i haven't heard anything about the proposal myself , 
but , uh , 
i haven't either . 
i think that all young kids ought to do a stint , uh , primarily in the military . 
most countries require that now , 
i don't know about the young women , 
i don't know if they have to serve in the military , 
a lot , 
 well , you take israel 
 i mean , everybody does . 
i don't think it's a bad idea , 
teaches a lot . 
i mean , i went in the service when i was eighteen ,
is that right ? 
i bet . 
you have to . 
yeah , 
my father had been in the military . 
i didn't do it myself . 
my father had 
and that's , uh , how he put himself through school basically . 
he came from a poor immigrant family , 
and he didn't have a chance to , uh , you know , 
the family wasn't wealthy , 
so he had to do something to ,
do it himself . 
and he did . 
and he was very successful . 
well , my parents wanted to send me to college , 
and i was dead set against it .
you know , i had wanderlust , you know . 
and i got in , 
and after wasting the first six years , partying and everything else , i decided , uhhuh , time to settle down and do something . 
so i started to work on my education . 
course my job was such that i couldn't do it as much as i wanted 
 and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree . 
that's pretty good . 
but , i've been in school ever since .
that's good . 
i guess . 
that's , uh , 
i don't know . 
there's other kinds of service to the country that could be done , you know , 
i mean if you don't like , 
i mean , working in the national parks ,
 i mean , i've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend *[[why no slash ?
oh yeah , 
i mean , 
all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients , 
and if they're ablebodied people , i don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and , if nothing else , get a group of them together and take them around to old folks 
we'd learn service to other people 
sure  , 
so i'm , 
get something out of that money . 
country would benefit , 
i mean , uh , 
my next door neighbor when i was growing up , worked for the unemployment division , 
and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and ablebodied 
that right . 
you know , these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks , 
and , back in those days they also use to give .
they and sit down and have poker games 
and i have a hard time dealing with that . 
what i hear one time , i think it was on paul harvey's , uh , radio segment , that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy , each person would receive like fortyfive thousand dollars . 
i mean , i was astounded . 
i don't even make that . 
i know . 
you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient , 
and somebody's taking that away . 
there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy . 
no doubt . 
you know , it's totally ridiculous , 
and now , i , uh , started out when i first got in graduate school 
i was going into public administration , 
and , uh , quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it any more . 
is that right , 
you sit there 
well , you need x number dollars for the recipients 
but you need x number dollars to administer the program . 
well just ridiculous . 
this is ridiculous . 
it's sad . 
it is , 
it's pathetic . 
i mean , there's got to be a different way . 
there's got to be a better way . 
but it'll never happen . 
i mean , these 
what would happen if the   required young people to do service to the country , 
what should they get in return , i wonder . 
like , uh , 
i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as , uh , 
and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance . 
give an incentive . 
educational or vocational training or something . 
something that's going to help them along the way . 
and they'll help the country eventually , too ,
i mean , 
well , this , 
i mean 
and that's only going to help . 
i mean , it's sad . 
one in five americans can't read 
adults , that is , can't even read . 
and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math . 
i mean , what are we becoming ? 
we're becoming a service country . 
as opposed to what we were twenty years ago . 
we were an industrial giant , 
and now we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game . 
we taught them how to do it , 
and they did it better than we do . 
simple as that . 
because they have the ambition , i guess . 
simple as that . 
which is good for them , 
but on the other hand , we kind of lose out . 
it's terrible for us . 
i think that if , uh , young people had service to the country might give them more ambition .
and it can be good for them , too . 
 i mean , even the greedy kids that we've got now  . . . 
oh god , you go to the mall 
and you see , you know , fourteen year old kids flaunting money , because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night , you know 
i know . 
for what . 
give me the money 
and i'll teach them something good .
well , you know , you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house . 
yeah , 
uh , that's my other complaint . 
parents aren't parents any more . 
they've relinquished their parenting . 
one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble ? 
well , as a substitute teacher for a year , i can say yes . 
i mean , i talked with somebody else about that another time , 
and , you know , when i's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math , i was , uh , teaching as part of the program . 
and i just love teaching . 
that's probably the most fun i had . 
and , uh , it helped me out because i learned 
but you know , for what . 
you know , i don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life . 
i mean , that's a sad thing to think , 
and that's kind of selfish on my part , 
and i admit that , 
but you have to look out for yourself 
that's right . 
i mean , that's some , 
and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers , 
that's wrong . 
i mean , 
i'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less , 
i saying teachers should be paid more . 
i mean yeah . 
they do an absolutely necessary job , 
i mean , i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that . 
but , uh , i mean , there's a sense of priorities here , too . 
you know , we need , 
what's more important , picking up the garbage or educating our kids . 
they both have their place . 
but , you know , when it gets right down to it , 
i mean , one's import , 
i mean , on the other hand , i mean , you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twentysix thousand dollars . 
that's pretty good . 
well i bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year . 
i mean , my other pet peeve is unions . 
you know , it's ridiculous the way unions have gone . 
there was a time when unions were needed . 
and they served a good function . 
but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated , 
and they're only there to perpetuate their own power structure . 
i remember , the company my dad worked for , the people there went on strike against the management . 
it was a steel manufacturing place , 
and they , uh , 
this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap , 
and they were having a hard time . 
we need you to come back and get this stuff done . 
or else we're going to be out of business . 
and they wouldn't come back , 
so they went bankrupt . 
and they all lost their jobs . 
 and it's like  , you know . 
so many times , i mean , you had uh , the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time . 
and , well , that took care of that industry 
that's right . 
detroit worked awfully hard on stopping car manufacturing in this country . 
and they're trying to do that now with the imports . 
i mean , you know , we've never caught up , 
and i don't think we ever will . 
it'll be a tough road , though . 
i mean , here it is , 
and we've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars . 
you know . nd they only did it because i guess they were embarrassed 
that's about right . 
well , back to the original subject , 
i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service , 
i don't care what kind it is . 
it teaches them pride in their country . 
and pride in themselves , too . 
that's right . 
i mean , you could organize something just within your community .
i mean , 
that's right . 
that's like eagle scouts . 
and that's a great idea . 
we need somebody  . . . 
we're going to talk about the public school system ,
well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is , uh , about the , uh , funding of , the school system right now . 
evidently , uh , that's a big problem . 
it's amazing , uh , 
i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough , i mean , 
when i was in college i enjoyed teaching , 
'cause i did some teaching parttime 
and i really enjoyed that 
but i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high , 
it just , you know , all the problems . 
oh , lord , i mean , yeah , 
an , you talk about stress and pressure , 
it's , uh , 
they're putting in fifty , sixty hours a week , 
i'm sure , because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready . 
you know , and they're being paid , probably half what most people being paid . 
and we're paying basketball people , you know , millions of dollars a year for what , you know . 
that's right , 
and then they , uh , poof it off , you know , do like tarpley . 
but , uh , i   
what gets me is i can't believe that uh , or , our state legislature can't come up with , uh , some kind of workable means to have funds for the school . 
you know , it's , uh , 
i just don't understand that . 
it's , uh . 
now do you have little kids , or what ? 
no , uh , 
my wife and i've just been married about two years 
but i have a sister that's a , uh , school teacher , 
and , uh . 
my wife and i have a two year old . 
so we're looking at well not this coming fall but the year after that . 
so it's getting close . 
he's going to be going to kindergarten , 
so , you know , we're thinking about that . 
what's that going to be like . 
are they going to be taught nothing , 
or they going be taught something , 
we're going to be involved in our child's education . 
we're going to be teaching him what we can at home , of course ,
that's true . 
and we're going to try to teach him good values , because , you know , understand some science .
that's bogus . 
well and , uh , you know , one thing my wife and i've talked about , are , uh , private schools .
and dallas , uh , school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling . 
i couldn't believe that . 
you know , that's one reason we bought a house here in plano . 
we were hoping , you know , well the school district's going to be good , you know , for resale value , and ,
but , uh , i can definitely , uh , see on down the road , you know , where we do have kids and are getting to that age , that's going to be a definite concern . 
before , about the school funding . 
i think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which i don't think will be necessarily the best way 
but i think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids . 
that's the only way they're going to fund it , because if they start raising taxes for property , people are going to throw a fit . 
and , you know , that's , 
taxes right now are political suicide .
oh , yeah . 
and i don't think any politician's going to do that , 
and the only thing , they would think of would be tuition , you know , 
if it works at colleges it will work down below . 
and , you know , that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school , of course , which is probably the only fair thing to do . 
but , it will be hard for those that people , that have in school because they have to pay out even more . 
and , you know , it's going to really hurt the middle class , uh , people , i think .
oh , yeah . 
that's right . 
so , uh , 
and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and knives and everything , 
now , that's just unbelievable to me , you know . 
i can't believe that . 
i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened . 
you never heard about that . 
well yeah , 
we didn't even think about it , you know .
and now , you know , what do we have now . 
you know , got kids that ,   either got you know , a magnum gun school , 
i mean , i mean b , teaching , or even being a student 
and think my oldest son , when he goes to school . 
what's going to happen ? 
i mean i'm afraid for him to go . 
but there  again   , you can't hold them back . 
another reason , yo , 
and you want to encourage them , you know , to be active and everything in school , 
but , uh , you know , with all the peer pressure that's going on , with all the negative things , uh , it's a tough environment to be growing up in . 
and lot tougher than it was when i was going to school , 
and that was , 
well i graduated high school in nineteen seventynine , 
that was what , twelve years ago , i guess . 
so , you know , it's lot different now . 
and what's it going to be like in another twelve years when my , uh , oldest son is in high school . 
that's right , 
i'm afraid to even think about it . 
yeah , that is a scary thought , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
you can deal with the problems as they come up . 
that's all you can do . 
you got to be your child's best friend , i guess ,
still you got to be their best friend because when they've got problems , who they going to go to , their friends that are dealing drugs , or your parents .
and if they go to their friends dealing drugs , they're going to be in even worse shape . 
that's right . 
don't really encourage to stay away from that , you know , 
the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war , etcetera , etcetera . 
they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad . 
maybe i'm wrong , because i haven't , you know , been in that kind of environment for a long time , 
need to teach them good values . 
that's true , 
and , uh . 
and the a c l u is going to get after them and have a lawsuit .
well and i think , uh , you touched on it , you know , 
you've got to start them at the home .
the deep rooted values 
that's all you can do . 
then you just have to hope and pray works out okay , 
that's right . 
well i got to be going , 
so , uh . 
well , hey , i appreciate the call . 
nice talking to you today . 
you to . 
have a good life , uh . 
how are you ? 
i'm doing fine . 
where you from ? 
i'm from new england . 
i'm from berkeley , california . 
this is quite a long distance . 
it certainly is . 
do you have any pets ? 
but none right now . 
how come , uh , you don't have any now ? 
you get tired of them ? 
well , i live in an apartment building 
just not feasible 
i'd love to have a dog , you know . 
i've got a little doggy , uh , that i've had uh , quite a long time . 
in fact , she just turned sixteen years old new year's eve . 
and , uh  , 
is she ? 
i beg your pardon ? 
what is she ? 
she's , uh , uh , uh , a poodle . 
uh , a toy poodle 
and she's , 
i got my mom a teacup  little mutt   , 
this is a little bigger than a teacup . 
and , uh , it's funny acquired this animal . 
uh , when i was , uh , married , my , uh , exwife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy . that she needed , 
uh , the woman needed someone to babysit 
and , uh , this is what she had told the kids 
and she even told me that . 
and after the two week period was up , uh , she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it . 
well , after you had an animal for a you become 
 oh , for sure . 
oh , yeah . 
so , i've had this dog now for sixteen years 
and she's been a lot of company .
uh , she's , uh , however , getting a little old 
and things are starting to fail . 
uh , i live alone now 
and she stays in the house all day while i go to work 
and , uh , she's been holding herself pretty well . uh , up until , you know , recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is 
and , uh , i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home . 
but she's usually pretty good . 
well . my mother has one that's , uh , 
uh , it's , uh , teacup 
and , uh , it's made such a difference for her . 
but , you know , just , i , e , you know , 
the way my mom's presence countenance is , just for having a puppy 
but , you know , having this dog 
she's had it for , i guess three years now .
but , uh , it's really made such a difference for her . 
i really would like to , uh , 
i'm a disabled person 
 so i'm unable to , really take care of a pet 
and if that weren't so , i would certainly have one . 
i just , 
it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog 
 yeah  .
 huh . well , you might want to get yourself , uh , an animal that doesn't require much attention . like a cat . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , i typically am not a cat person . 
i have a friend that , uh , has on occasion , uh brought her cat over for me to keep .
and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen . 
and , uh , it would sleep on my chest ,
it's just a great cat , 
 well , is a dog . 
uh , i don't know uh , that i would ever want a cat . 
oh , i like cats . 
i just wouldn't want to own one . 
 well , you don't own cats . 
but they , 
i don't know , 
i can't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog . 
they own you 
we're supposed to appreciate them . 
well , uh , when i come home in the evenings , my dog greets me at the door . 
i don't know that a cat would do that , uh .
i used to have ,
i could just walk in the door 
and she knew whether to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over . 
 i mean she really could pick up on my mood 
it was , uh , uncanny .
huh . i think , uh , in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because , uh , she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too .
i know like when she has an accident , i know she's not doing it on purpose . 
 uh , and , you know , some people might not believe that 
 but , uh , i do .
oh , absolutely . 
like to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did .
that's the way , 
well , i had that cat that i mentioned ,  alfie  .
one morning , you know , the first thing you do is you get up and and you make sure that it can get to its litter box . 
and , uh , the next morning , uh , when my roommate got up that it was going to protest . 
and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket ,
all right . have i got your attention now ? 
 oh , yes . 
animals have a way of talking .
 alfie  did . 
i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day . 
 uh , that i'd trade my dog in for the world . 
uh , it was about two years ago she got sick on me 
and i took her and , uh , she wasn't able to jump . 
she , you know , lost all her activity 
and , uh , she stayed there for one day 
and the doctor called me up and said , uh , she had a low white cell count and that , uh , animal hospital .
so i took his suggestion 
and i , uh , took the dog hospital there 
and they said they'd keep her there for three days . 
well , she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care .
it cost me over five hundred dollars . 
plus , uh , the vet sent me a bill for what he did 
and , uh , then she recouped . 
she was okay for a couple of years . 
and then she got sick on me again 
and i brought her to a different vet this time 
and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything .
and , uh , he gave me the same medication that i gave her the last time 
and she was okay 
and she's been okay every since . 
it's been about two years now . 
huh . well , that's great , 
it really is . 
i'm glad  that  she was able to pull out of it  that way  and so cheaply the second time . 
what do you want to do ? 
i probably would have had second thoughts . 
of course , you would . 
 but well , what they do is , is they say , well it's going to cost , you know , twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this 
you know , and it creeps up on you . 
you don't know that , uh , you know .
you don't know what it's going to until it's all over . 
uh , to give you an example . my mom had an elderly cat who , uh , whoever evidently got a hold of it 
and , uh , the cat got sick . 
so she took the cat to the vet 
and she had the cat there for two days 
and then the cat died . 
and you owe me this bill , 
and oh , by the way , do you want me to bury the cat .
so , it cost her three hundred dollars , uh , 
and she didn't get the cat back . 
so , yeah , 
they had to pay for all the medical , uh , bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses . 
 so that 
 at lea ,  
you kind of wonder what really happened . 
well even the , you know , 
and then the cat , uh , died . 
my goodness . 
 i'm looking for another cat for them . uh , 
i've got a little kitten , uh , that's still , uh , just being born right now . 
so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the little kitten over uh , to my folks . 
well , that will make their day . 
i think it will 
because they're both it turns out to be , uh , uh , a pleasant experience for them . 
uh , i think they enjoy that . 
only work initially . 
for cats anyway , you know . 
well , listen 
it's been a pleasure talking to you . 
well , the same here . 
and you take care . 
bye now . 
what is that sound ? 
that's my buzzer at the door .
oh , okay . 
i'll let you go . 
thank you .
uh , so what do you do to exercise ? 
uh , s , 
i , uh , weight train , uh , three days on and one day off . 
i , uh , ride bicycles ,  , uh , fifteen , twenty miles , i don't know , maybe three times , maybe four times a week . 
i play basketball , uh , couple times a week . 
i play softball one night a week . 
uh , that's what i do . 
what about yourself ? 
that's pretty impressive . 
uh , i guess i bicycle . 
uh , the amount varies 
as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week . 
uh , i guess a play softball one night a week . 
and i backpack a lot over the summer . 
oh , really ? 
i mean , i don't do any of those things particularly , you know , for exercise . 
but , uh , i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of , like , do if i feel like i need to go exercise .
uh , but i do it mostly for fun . 
it varies . 
uh , out near my house is pretty hilly . 
uh , but sometimes i bike to work which is about , uh , a fifteen mile trip each way . 
and that's mostly flat . 
how long does that take you to get to work ? 
uh , about fortyfive , fifty minutes . 
work out with , uh , storing your bike and showering and all that ? 
it can be a pain . 
uh , basically , uh , i work on a campus 
so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the , uh , campus to the , uh , gym , use the shower there 
 uh , but , it's enough of a pain , that i did it consistently one year , 
i would commute every day , uh , 
but it just became such a pain . 
i mean we're talking , you know , fortyfive , fifty minutes for biking ,
it was a big hunk of the day .
uh , and then of course another hour to get back home . 
uh , so i've been doing that less , and concentrating more on , you know , light biking when i get home on the evening and then , you know , some more on the weekends . 
do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there ? 
uh , i guess mostly i bike on my own . 
i've got a touring bike .
how about you , 
what kind of biking do you do ? 
uh , well , actually my wife just got me into it 
and i did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas ,
and i learned all the health benefits of , you know , 
i was a solid weight trainer , 
and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise 
and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it , 
so i began a program i don't know probably three or four weeks ago 
and i did my first bike rally this saturday . 
i did , uh , forty miles , 
and , uh , that's the longest i've ever ridden so far , 
i usually , you know , fifteen or twenty . 
and it was kind of hilly 
and it was pretty tough , 
but , uh , i'm looking at , uh , doing a lot more of it because , you know , my wife is really into it , 
oh , i see . 
and this weekend . 
she wanted to go , go , go , 
it's good to have a partner . 
it really is . 
are you think of doing any , like , centuries , or  . . . 
i mean people seem to get into different aspects . 
one is more of a distance , 
and one's more , just , you know , 
they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour . 
i've never really looked into that . 
you know , that's , 
my wife would just love that . 
and i may do that sometime . 
there again , i'm just kind of a fledgling into this . 
it's kind of funny . 
i called this number 
and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up . 
i mean , around texas , you got about five or six , 
if you live around the dallas area , you got five or six every weekend to choose from .
oh , that's nice . 
bicycling is really big here . 
i didn't know that , you know , until i came down here , and ,
because i lived in indiana all my life 
and , you know , you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle or above the age of fifteen or something , 
 but , other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here . 
i'm not sure why that is . 
i mean , generally in the midwest it seems to be much less . 
i mean , maybe it's because of the winters .
so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation . 
there's a lot of bikers around here . 
it's really neat . 
there are a lot of resources , a lot of magazines , and stuff , 
little texas bicyclist , is like a little newspaper that comes out every month . 
it's free 
just go to the bike shop and pick it up , 
and it's got all the rides coming up , 
so i guess i'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer ,
oh , that's terrific . 
see a little bit of texas i've never seen before . 
so , uh , how long have you been biking ? 
oh , i guess as an adult for just about the past , uh , three years or so .
uh , you know , i guess last time i did it before that was college , which was about ten years ago . 
and , uh , yeah , 
i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while , uh , until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot . 
and so i thought i'd try it , too . 
have uh , a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking ,
because from what i understand , it really improves your , uh , cholesterol 
 and , you know , uh , it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is , uh , uh , low cardiovascular fitness , and also , uh , you know , the cholesterol . 
it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls . 
oh , that's great . 
so  . . . 
my resting pulse . 
you know , it gets it down to about forty . 
that's good . 
you say you ride about a hundred , hundred fifty miles a week ? 
that's hardcore . 
on average , 
when do you get to begin with the winters and all that ? 
what time of the year do you usually embark on your , 
do you ride inside if you can't ride outside ? 
i mean there are some people , 
in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow . 
they've got a , uh , mountain bike ,
and , i don't do that . 
i pretty much lay off for the winter . 
uh , i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter , you know , because it will help your balance when you're indoor training . 
uh , but i just , you know , more or less stocked , like an exercise bike and that kind of thing .  , uh , 
but , yeah , 
i mean winters are kind of a problem 
so , i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking , i guess , this year for just a couple of weeks . 
uh , but , you know , up here  , it's only stopped snowing since then . 
uh ,  , but , yeah , 
it's pretty good . 
it's , uh , 
the main thing , i guess , for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like , you know , exercise and a chore  , i'll lay off it more . 
so you , uh , change up your routes a lot , and keep a  . . . 
oh , yeah , 
i try to go someplace pretty different , you know , every week . 
i rotate around , uh , about four different routes , uh , from my house 
or i'll sometimes come in the school . 
it's nice coming , 
it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path  , uh , 
because it's along the erie canal up here . 
so , what school is it ? 
uh , university of rochester . 
oh , okay . 
so it's fairly picturesque . 
it's a good ride 
as long as you're not doing it every day , it's a good ride .
that's true . 
sounds neat . 
it's kind of , 
i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else , 
but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week . 
that's , uh , motivating . 
that's really good . 
oh , it was good talking to you . 
and keep up the good work . 
you , too . 
all right . 
take care . 
uh , far as , you know , crime in the cities , i'm sure , like in yours it's pretty bad . 
uh , probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies 
and theft and probably murder 
how about you ? 
uh , well , i don't actually live in the city , 
i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life , 
but crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution , uh , and sale of drugs . 
probably right , if you look at it from that stand point . 
what , uh , 
is there anything , uh , that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing ? 
uh , where i live now it's not so bad . 
i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it . 
uh , but i do have friends that live in the city 
and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing . uh , just because there are , like , crack houses , you know , on their street and stuff like this . 
i live out in the country , 
how far out from the city , i mean , do you , 
i'm about fifteen miles out . 
about fifteen miles . 
i live in a little suburb , uh , which i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so 
 but it's pretty congested . 
we are considered in the country , 
but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country . 
our major crimes in our immediate town , uh , is probably house robberies 
however , i'm sure they're there . 
but , uh , right now our neighborhood is running about , uh , eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed ,
 that's huge  .
and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or , you know , uh , burglar alarms 
it's cut back , you know , considerably , 
but it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood , 
so it still , uh , remains city wide , pretty high . 
are there any theories on why this is happening ? 
uh , i would say the majority of it's happening during the day , uh , between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon . 
but why ? 
why is it happening ? 
well , most families are young 
and both people are working . 
so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work . 
uh , so , uh , i would say that's probably their prime motivation . 
they'll stock your house and , uh , look at your pattern and then go from there . 
so they're professionals ? 
uh , you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier , uh , just taking , uh , you know , just junk items that they can just get , you know , ten to twenty bucks for real quick . 
probably the biggest items would be the high classed automobiles , 
the , you know , mercedes , volvos , things that they can get , you know , big dollars for 
guns , that sort of stuff . 
very few , you know , penny ante stuff . 
well , what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime ? 
well , uh , the police force , for one , 
i think they could , uh , definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use . 
uh , it's , 
oh , right now i think , we are about thirty thousand people 
and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty , 
but , i mean , that's going to tend to , 
i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher  , 
in other words , you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit . 
the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place . 
well , the , 
course in our particular state , uh , we have the prison overcrowding , whatever , 
so they're giving the early release , uh , 
they're doing that in our state , too . 
and it's , 
i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences , uh , 
but for the , 
so you think that would be a deterrent ? 
and , uh , not necessarily , you know , give in to their , uh , human rights desires . 
you know , if they're overcrowded , just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate . uh , 
well , what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty ? 
uh , i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty , you know , in a lot of cases . 
course , i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof . 
so you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody . 
i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence ,
and then those convicted , especially of , you know , murder and , uh , you know , major crimes ,
uh , especially , you know , in the case of murder 
 uh , i know in my case , my wife and daughter were kidnapped ,
oh , wow . 
oh , my goodness . 
 and the individuals got caught , 
and , uh , you know , two counts of kidnapping , uh 
and , you know , he was out within two months because of the parole system . 
so what , 
did you sue him under the civil system ? 
do what now ? 
well , you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something , right ,
well , the insurance companies and all that tried to go after him 
he has nothing , 
there's nothing that he has that you could go after . 
makes you wish that uh , still had indentured servitude , for this sort of thing . 
uh , very seld , 
but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt . 
they don't do that here . 
course they pay them , 
but you don't , 
you or the insurance companies never see any of that money . 
that's too bad . 
they're repeat offenders , 
they , uh , been in jail before  , 
they've been released , you know , several times , which is another ,
but , uh , you know , basically the guy commits , you know three major crimes uh , 
i think that's re , 
and we're out , you know , uh , you know , fifteen thousand dollars 
that's awful .
and he goes out and commits it again . 
fact , he's back in jail now . 
so , what , uh , 
gives you sympathy for the vigilantes . 
what deterrent does he really have ? 
yeah , 
i think real possibility . 
uh , we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually , you know , shot the people 
oh , my god . 
 and , uh , return offenders have , 
they've actually waited for them , where they've robbed , you know , particular neighborhood , 
they'll rob one house , 
then other people will wait up , you know , and wait for somebody to do something else , try to take it in their own hands . 
course it doesn't always work out in their favor . 
you can , 
you can't get all of us . 
uh , and we're beginning to see more and more of that . 
and that's a deterrent , too . if you think the home owner might be armed , right , and awake 
here you break in , 
and you're going to get shot . 
we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in , you know , during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death . 
and , uh , it helps for a while 
 but then just another different set of people come in , 
and most of the people are transients from outside of the state . 
uh , i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught , they're from places like up in oklahoma , and louisiana , arkansas , you know , across the border . 
so , you know , people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever 
it's not many from the local communities . 
but , uh , it's a problem , 
and stiffer in their penalties , 
would be a definite deterrent 
i mean , i tend to agree with you . 
i think , uh , what i would like to see is , number one , completely getting rid of these victimless crimes . uh , there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it 
and i think one of the big things that you can do to increase deterrence is , uh , if someone is found guilty of a , uh , felony level offense , they lose their citizenship . 
and they lose their constitutional rights .
and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about , you know , protecting these people from , we just don't protect them . 
i know like in my wife's case , they made her feel like the criminal . 
i know , 
and i think that's ridiculous . 
all  . . . 
have you painted something lately ? 
that room i showed you . 
and then since then we have painted the bedroom . 
oh yeah , 
another bedroom . 
the brown one . 
the one that looks like a fudgesicle . 
oh yeah 
well , i painted the outside of my house 
but blown , ceiling .
oh yeah . 
well , that is hard . 
now , i asked janice , or somebody recently how you do that 
 well , how do you get the edge though ? 
the straight edge ? 
you just have to be real careful . 
oh , i see . 
we use , uh , uh , a two inch brush uh , on a slant 
 and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes . 
huh . well are you going to paint the outside of your house too ? 
well , yeah . 
oh really ? 
see the people that own the house they , uh , pay for anything like that , that we do .
 oh nice . 
there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses . 
so , i am thinking i am going to change it to , uh , something , you know , 
the brick is multi color .
oh , that will be nice . 
 or two tone . 
there are some columns that could be painted a different color too . 
what color did you paint your house ? 
on the out , 
 but , i have a problem . 
i can't get up high 
and we can't paint the chimney .
well , you have got to get one of those ladders . 
we have one of those ladders . 
we are just not willing to get up that high . 
oh , yeah . 
a friend of mine that lives out in your neighborhood , he has done his house 
and that is what he , 
i was out there last week 
and he has finished everything except the chimney . 
well , we did too . 
we did it in the fall 
and it's just too high . 
it is really scary , 
but it 
other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional . 
well , our house in new mexico , it was stucco , 
but we had all this trim to paint , and lots of it . 
and we did basically seventyfive percent of the house 
and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff . 
so , i hired this man to come in and do it . a young kid . 
and he came with his own raf , 
what do you call those things ? 
the blowers ? 
oh , oh , oh , oh , i know what you are talking about . uh 
that's it .
he came and did it that way 
and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up . 
 and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because 
 and if he fell , he was dead 
and he knew that .
oh , my . 
so that was worth it getting a professional 
plus , he cleaned up my mess . 
 oh , i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney , 
but other than that , it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself . 
it wasn't too bad . 
i mean you think , 
how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside ? 
shoot , maybe a hundred and fifty . 
since , it is a one story , 
but we did , uh , like two heavy coats over it . 
 but then that way 
but , that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood 
 and yet he bought like seventeen gallons . 
my word . 
and , anyway , when he checked out 
oh , my word . 
and uh , he had already carried a ladder outside 
and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint 
 so she had to start all over again 
 and when he got outside , he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninetynine or something . 
oh , my word . 
and he saw   .
so that was really worth it . painting his own house . 
it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff . 
oh , my word .
well , he really saved in that way . 
 but , yeah , 
i think we are going to do , uh , another bathroom , 
but i think i will probably just do it , in a roller . 
i want to do it about the same color . and just be a little , 
uh . rollers are so messy . 
we never   any more . 
oh , i know . 
but it's the textured wall . 
well , a little paintbrush , 
so what do you think ? 
uh , the causes of crime ? 
um , i think it was imbalance of power in the united states . 
it's causing the lower class to rebel . 
that's why there's su , such high crime , 
and , uh , there's crime in , uh , young people because they don't have ro , role models 
see too much crime on t v 
and they think it's the way to go . 
i don't know . 
what do you think ? 
i agree with the upper and lower level , you know 
because that's the lowest thing for themselves , 
plus there's nobody for them to look up to . 
but i also blame some of it on parents 
because parents aren't parents . 
because i remember even when i was growing up , 
i'm thirtyfive 
i remember when i was growing up , 
and i had friends , 
they used to do stuff like , you know , go over to a store and steal stuff . 
and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from 
from anybody else . 
and i think 
so they don't care . 
i think i can agree with that too . 
but now , as far as what they can do about it , i don't know . 
you can't make parents be parents .
that's true . 
you got to kind of make people want to do the right thing . 
you know . 
i don't know how you do that . 
i guess if you gave the , gave them jobs , 
that's another problem with the united states , 
there's no jobs any more . 
well , i've heard this one theory , that if , that if a kid commits a crime , that , uh , instead of the , prosecuting the kid , they prosecute the parent . 
or both of them . 
that would work to a point , 
now , to put the blame on the parent . 
well , that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway . 
i don't care what you do to them . 
you know , 
so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in , you know . 
because a , a , a child can get into anything regar , 
i don't care how good you , they are . 
eventu , at least one time , 
but now if this is a repeated thing , 
here with this child in juvenile , 
and or , to me , yeah , both of them . 
because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do . 
because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them , um , twenty twenty , fortyeight hours , one of them shows 
i don't know 
  it was a little , it was a little gang of them 
i understand . 
and then when they caught him , you know , his mother sitting there , 
now they going to take me away from you . 
that meaned she was warned . 
but see , by that , i think sometimes it's a little late . 
you know , 
but i'm sure there's something can be done . 
what about with adults ? 
anything do any about   adult crime . 
start prosecuting they 
but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system . 
well , for one , a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded . 
well , they should start with , the , 
if they would get rid of . 
seems to me , i know there's a lot about court that people don't understand . 
there's more people in jail right now for child support , okay 
you ought to take all them little misdemeanor people 
let them go , 
you know , give them a fine , whatever , 
make them do civic duty whatever , 
i mean seriously , 
put them fools in there , 
they ought to put those   people to work . 
i call them all fools , idiots , whatever . 
little rock stars , put all them in there . 
you know , the murderers , the drug dealers , the user , put them all in 
and let all the normal people go 
you know , because , okay , 
let them people go . 
not let them go and get out of it . 
they , you still have to punish them . 
let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else 
but pu , don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals . 
and they're , they're still , they can provide for society , 
whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society . 
i don't know , 
some people , boy , they got , 
i think the united states has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else . 
that's true . 
now how they going to fix it , i don't know . 
i don't think there is a ready solution . 
i don't think so either . 
because the economy is down , people , you know , the , the , the low man on the pole is getting more of the , i guess , the bulk of it . 
and he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet . 
and they keep taking more money from us 
and people are get , 
and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it . 
might as well steal , 
then they don't have to pay taxes on it .
that's it . 
so , you know , they , i , i , i know that's bad , but , you know , just like texas now . 
they could have had a lottery . 
they don't want a lottery . 
why not ? 
i would rather pay for a lottery 
they'd have a , 
because , you know , they take , 
and uncle sam takes his , 
the social security which probably won't be here when i get that old 
because we're paying for social security they using now . 
who's going to pay for mine ? 
i don't know .
 but it's , it's 
i'm not counting on it . 
you don't count on social security . 
but , it's , it's , 
that's what i'm saying , 
they need to do something else . 
crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down . 
and it's going to get worse . 
that's just like last night they killed them people in that store . 
where you at ? 
i'm in raleigh , north carolina . 
no wonder you don't know that . 
well , where are you from ? 
i'm in dallas . 
but last night , they killed , uh , uh , four people in a chain food . 
oh , man . 
and killed them , 
well , it was two stores side by side . 
one was a store and one was like a , a fast food place , 
  chicken or something , i don't know . 
anyway , they raped the women , beat them all up , including the women , 
i mean , they just beat them . 
stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all . 
why was , you know , why 
why did they do in the freezer ? 
you know , why didn't they just , 
if they was going to lock them , just lock them in the freezer , take the money , you know . 
they didn't have to kill them or rape them , or anything . 
that's awful . 
we still get some in raleigh . 
i mean , not 
it's just getting really ridiculous down here . 
i wish i could move somewhere where , this , you know , you got to like in the country . 
i don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes . 
well , i think , if it's , 
the town is smaller 
and everybody knows everybody 
it's harder 
where is , 
and , and , and see that's another thing . 
neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more . 
there's nobody is next door to you , 
you don't know your neighbors , and stuff like that . 
it's just , huhuh , you know , 
because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers . 
and you didn't even , 
and what the manager , the manager won't even do anything . 
he's probably a drug dealer himself .
you never know . 
you don't . 
and so i moved , 
because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up 
and this is like across the street . 
this was a nice part of town 
and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that , making that , um , crack stuff 
and then , the other time i saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner . 
time to go . 
that's it , 
and i moved . 
and , you know , now i live in like a fam , a neighborhood in a town house , 
but it's nice . 
i don't , you know . 
i'm kind of in the same , same kind of deal , town house in a neighborhood . 
it's pretty nice . 
i don't know how they can live , a neighborhood or apartment complex . 
that's what happen , that's what wrong ,
i don't think , don't rent to them .
or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers . 
put it on the lease . 
if you deal drugs , you can't live here . 
most of them are too scared to do anything about it . 
that's it . 
all right . 
well listen , i got to go . 
all righty . 
nice talking to you . 
and i thank you . 
all right . 
i've , uh , 
as far as i'm concerned , i find that the young women have lost so much because they have become more aggressive and more dominating , 
and i think that comes about from their being a definite factor in the job market now . 
oh , well , i tend , i tend to agree . 
uh , in some ways i think it's , uh , i think if anything , a lot of , um , the changes that have occurred , uh , 
in some ways they're for the better 
because i think women should have a choice , 
and i do believe in the , being able to have a choice as to , as far as , what you would like to do with your life . 
but by the same token , and i know this for myself because i've worked and i've not worked , um , 
that it makes it , uh , sometimes it makes life more difficult . 
i think when the roles now are less defined , as far as , you know , what , uh , women should or should not be doing , that it , it , it could make life more difficult . 
there are more things to work out . 
i know when i was working , you know , you have all these problems with , with the child care and , and with , uh , pleasing , you know , your boss on the job , 
so you have added stresses from there 
and then you still have all the things that , um , that you need to do at home 
and that doesn't change , you know , 
just because your going out of the house for so many hours a day doesn't , uh , make those other things go away 
and the other responsibilities are still important . 
so , um , have you , have you worked outside , also and , um , feel that , it , that , 
well , how do you feel , as far as , uh , 
what would be a happy medium 
or , or what would you like to see ? .
i would like , uh , 
i was a school teacher , 
and we had one child when i taught for my two year career . 
uh , we , 
uh , then i stopped teaching after my husband's bus , business was established , 
and we had two children 
and i stayed home with those children ,
and now that my husband has retired , i am back substitute teaching , 
which if anyone has ever been involved in that , some days it's fun 
and some days you wonder why you're even bothering , 
because your fighting for your life . 
but , i am a fighter 
and i've always been a disciplinarian . 
uh , i'm , i'm not real sure that the young girls of today are being forced into the job market as many of them imply . 
i think they're going in by choice . 
oh , i think so . 
yes . 
and , and i have no problem with that , 
but i think the male needs to be the dominant person . 
and i think too many of the young professional wives in our small town of five thousand , uh ,
they are very aggressive . 
they're , uh , they almost have what i would call a killer e , killer bee instinct . 
and they have to be in charge . 
[children well , what do you think , {water running 
though , um , um , 
i don't know . 
the , the one problem i guess i have , 
and maybe what so many women , younger women now are choosing to go outside is , 
i feel that in general , in this society , that being at home is not looked upon as , um , a job in itself . 
whereas , you know , you hear a lot of women that are home saying that it is a job in itself , 
but i know when i was working , 
and i was a , an engineer so i was always with men , 
uh , and they were single , many of them , 
i used to leave at three ,
and they had , they used to look down on women that were home , 
you know , at least you get out of here at three 
and you can go home and put your feet up and watch soap operas , 
oh , sure .
and i used to be infuriated , 
because they really had no idea what was involved once i got home . 
now taking care of them , running them everywhere , helping with homework , the bath , the whole , you know , everything . 
um , and i think that one reason that so many younger women feel im , i , compelled to go into a profession is that they feel that if they stay home they are not respected ,
and , there's a lot of truth to that 
and i don't know how you feel . 
i don't know how you felt when you were home and what kind of feedback you got , 
but i can see with the younger men that they definitely are looking down upon women that are home . 
and yet by the same token , i think some of it is jealousy , 
you , you , 
i wish i was the one , 
i would stay home with my kids if my wife would go out and support us , .
if my wife had an education and could support us , 
and the only value i see coming out of ,
because i see my sonsinlaw , 
i have a daughter who's a nurse 
and i have a daughter ,
and i see ,
that's true . 
because he ,
that's true . 
and he got home at six fifteen . 
and , uh , he ate his dinner 
and he was asleep in his chair because he was exhausted . 
so , now the young fathers are having a chance to parent , 
and i think ,
and they enjoy it . 
and they do enjoy it . 
you're right . 
i see many more men in the supermarket ,
and i think that is healthy because ch , 
and i think it's a , a wonderful advantage for the young , for the , for the , particularly for the males , for the little boys to have ,
oh , yeah . 
and , and i don't ,
but , uh , i don't understand why the young girls feel like they have to build roads , 
and they have to ,
and we just recently finished a long drive through the west , a little over five thousand miles , 
and at one point we sat down , uh , 
i didn't realize it , 
but i sat at a counter to have a cup of coffee that happened to be for truck drivers only . 
and here's this young girl with the tattoos 
and she w , has just , had just driven a load of meat from minneapolis to some place in arizona , 
and she'd been , 
and i ask her how old she was 
and she was the ag , between the age of our daughters 
and she had been driving ,
i mean ,
i guess i'm s , i'm a , maybe victorian 
and my husband is a little bit of a male chauvinist , 
in that ,
but he also thinks a woman should be taken care of and , and in the home , 
and she should vote , 
but after she talks to her husband about how she ought to vote . 
oh , boy .
now it probably doesn't work that way in our household because i have strong opinions about things ,
but , uh , i like being taken care of . 
i like my luggage ,
and i think the young women are losing that 
and i think that's sad . 
well , that , that's true . 
there is that part , too , 
and i guess we also have to examine though 
and although your husband's probably been as much conditioned as , you know , anybody else , 
he was raised in the south , 
i think that's a little war condition , .
i guess ha , 
oh , oh , yeah . 
and , and you have to , i guess you have to question too , why a lot of the men , especially , i think middle age and older men , why they feel that way 
and , and i think it gets scary for them to see change , also . 
they've been used to being , really to be honest , in , in society , and in a way , number one , 
and they come home 
and everything's done for them . 
and their meal is served 
and i think it's frightening to them to see the roles switching . 
and i think , i think this reaction comes more out of fear . 
now , my husband is , um , he's ten years older than me , 
but he has , his attitudes are very much prowomen , procareer , which is kind of interesting . 
he comes from a culture where women are , stay at home and do everything , 
um , and yet ,  , {door you know , for me to be able to , uh , uh , advance or go back to work or whatever . 
i'm kind of more , 
{talking to someone in background , thank you , {resumes talking to speaker a 
i'm kind of more middle of the road . 
i think that when children are small , i think it's okay for women to work especially , 
there should be some , a lot more part time , 
but i think it's , um , 
i don't believe in this career , you know , this career drive when , when they're small , because i think , 
{talking to someone in background , they're downstairs aaron , {resumes talking to a 
i think that's very , um , unfair to , to children , 
like , uh , engineers usually work fifty or sixty hours a week , 
i refused to work more than thirty . 
i was parttime 
and even that was a rat race , 
but i think you have to put in perspective , that , you know , when the kids came home from school , i wanted to be here . 
i didn't want , i don't want a job where i'm traveling around and an , i'm away and , uh , 
so i think you can have both . 
it's more hectic , 
but i think you have to put into perspective what your kids need ,
i think a lot of ,
i , i don't have any children , 
but i , i have a lot of friends with children 
and i know they spend a lot of time with them . 
which is good , you know . 
that's good to hear . 
an , i haven't , uh , 
well i've been around a lot of people lately at wo , at my job that don't have a lot of values .
so , it's , it's always nice to see people that like each other , 
and like families that get along with each other and like to do things together . 
ha , have a lot of values , 
i love that . 
do they have children ? 
but she's married , 
and i , i'm not quite sure why . 
i , i think he said that he'd give her a big ring and she got married to him . 
oh , that's wonderful .
but , it , it's kind of weighed on me 
and then the other day my husband and i met a couple who , who , 
they're just going to have their first child 
and they really like each other . 
and they're real happy with one another 
and there's not enough time to spend with him in the evening 
oh , that's neat . 
that's good , you know , 
i like to see that . 
you know , i have , uh , some friends that , uh , 
first of all , uh , the girls joined , 
they have two girls , 
one joined the girl scouts 
and the other was in the brownies 
and then the mother got involved as a leader 
and then all of a sudden the father was getting involved with doing nature hikes for them and working with the girl scout camp he , here in dallas and then going out to , uh , betty perot camp and working with the horses and stuff 
and they're gone a lot 
and they take their girls 
and they go away for weekends and in the winter time even , you know , to do work with the girl scouts 
and i think it's neat . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , they've really become very much involved in , in just that one organization , 
which the organization can use the help too . 
so , i , i wish i could see more of that , you know . 
on sunday we just met , uh , a family , 
we were thinking about getting   cat 
and we went over to , uh , lady that breeds them here in town 
and , uh , her daughter actually was , 
he , she said that her husband said to her daughter , you need a hobby , 
so , she chose the cats . 
and you can tell , it's a family hobby . 
the , they're all a part of it . 
and it was really neat because they all were interested in each other and , and the cats 
and they raise champion cats . 
so , they've done really well . 
those are neat cats , too . 
i've just learned about that breed . 
they're really nice looking cats . 
i have seven cats 
but they're all mongrels .
well that's what we're going to end up getting .
well they're the ones that need the homes . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , mine were just all , uh , strays in the neighborhood . 
little baby kittens dropped and stuff 
and it just kind of built . 
one at a time , just kin , 
i couldn't , you know . 
one time two of them came at once 
and i can't turn a hungry cat down . 
oh , i know . 
so , you know , 
and the last one that i pic , was here , uh , 
the kids brought him over and said he was injured 
and it was winter time 
i just can not have another cat 
and i looked out there 
and he was just laying on my lawn just shivering and all , 
i brought him in so . 
those are my children . 
we don't have very many activities 
i know what you mean , 
our cat hates other cats , 
and , th , we've tried to get her to like other cats 
and she just , uh , she wants to be around human beings 
and she does not want to be around other cats . 
so our next , uh , 
we're going to try it with a kitten and see if her maternal instincts come out . 
ha , ha , lots of luck . 
is she spayed . 
oh , yeah , 
real maternal .
we're hoping , 
it's our last hope .
she'll eventually , 
i mean , mine , you know , i have five males and two females . 
everybody's spayed , 
everybody's neutered 
and we still have a scrap every now and then . 
nothing real bad , you know , 
a slap here and there , 
but , uh , they put up with each other 
and they will eventually . 
he , her nose will be out of joint for a while 
and she'll hiss and growl and slap every now and then , 
but they'll , she'll finally accept it . 
you know , they really don't have any choice .
they mi ,  , 
in my household , we have a little bit , of , uh , a fight for whose boss . 
i mean a male cats are , are re , you know , real territorial 
and so that's the big battle here , you know , 
of whose , whose top dog , we , top cat , i guess . 
you know , but , uh , 
we , i don , i don't know , 
i don't have a problem with it . 
i think they just learn to accept . 
and i have two dogs too , 
and they've slapped the dogs around too .
every now and then , 
that's true , 
they've got to keep them in line . 
but she'll accept another cat eventually . 
as long as you make her feel , uh , like she's still loved and everything , 
well those   cats were great . 
they were fourteen pounds and , 
 and they'r , 
oh , they're just gorgeous , 
but , yeah , 
three hundred and fifty dollars for a kitten . 
oh my gosh .
and i think of those , 
i think of the kittens at the pound . 
three hundred and fifty dollars {whispers . 
and they are lovely 
till whispering ugh , 
house payment .
that is a lot of money . 
and you can't do all this stuff 
i don't let mine out anyway , 
i let two of them out just in the back yard every now and then , 
but my cats are insi , 
i'm afraid , you know , the neighbors will , 
people throw rocks at them , 
and people run over them 
and , i , i just , you know , i just don't . 
i know so , 
and , and now they've lost the desire . 
most of them don't even try to ge , you know , to go out . 
i just have two that drive me crazy ,
but i won't let them get , 
if they start going in the front and stuff , i bring them in . 
you know , i just worry , 
i guess i'm too protective , 
but , you know . 
i see these cats that are wandering around the neighborhood 
and too they can catch diseases really easy , 
just by touching a nose to another cat they can contac , leukemia , feline leukemia , 
we know we try , try real hard to keep them healthy . 
uh , we just bought , uh , acre , a house with an acre to try to , so she'll have some room to walk around ,
oh , how neat . 
we're , we're choosing our house for our cat . 
isn't that bad .
people do it for their children  , 
i mean , why not . 
oh , them too .
well you know , why not , 
we , because i , she loves , she's one of those that loves th , outside , 
and , and she doesn't go far 
but she just wants to be able to have that freedom . 
well if you're off , off , of a , you know , away from a road , 
you're off of the main road , you said ? 
away from a road , you know , and you keep an eye on her , it's probably okay . 
i'm just real , 
i don't know , i guess , 
i'm in a neighborhood 
and it's , it's just real tough on animals here , you know . 
it gets hard , especially with the cars . 
whe , i , every time i see one run over i just , you know , 
it makes me sick , 
so , you know , 
oh , i know . 
but anyway , we kind of got off the subject of children , 
except that i consider them my children .
our cats are our kids 
i , we , we got married a few months ago 
oh , no . 
in , in her little bridesmaid dress .
you know , if i could have , i would have . 
well i'm sure it's been done . 
well they have weddings for dogs now and cats 
you know , they have all that parties for them where they dress up . 
i've seen it in magazines and stuff where you dress your animals up and take them to a par , 
oh , my . 
i haven't gone that far . 
i'm not that bonkers . 
you know , my cats do not wear clothes , 
an  , 
i , i don't think they'd like to . 
i put a bow on her one ni , one day 
i took a picture of her 
and that was all it , all it lasted for . 
we , d , do any of your friends have , have , uh , older children that they do anything with . 
do , do you have friends with older children , 
or do they just all have young kids . 
um , yeah , 
my brotherinlaw has three young kids seven and on down 
and they , they go on family vacations 
and , uh , they go , like to go skiing , 
we , the , the middle girl doesn't get a whole lot of attention , 
but , uh , this last ski trip they took , uh , she had in , contracted chicken pox first 
and then she spread it to her , her li , younger sister and her brother 
and they got it just at the beginning of the vacation , where she got better . 
so , sh , not only is she the better skier , but she got all the attention , because she got to go out . 
i think she planned it . 
she's only five , 
but i think she planned it .
and she got all the attention from her dad . 
oh , see there , 
oh yeah . 
you know , it must be hard when you have a lot of children , 
i , you know , to ha , i was an only child , 
my mother was an only child 
so , i , you know , i wasn't raised with brothers or sisters 
and i always got all the attention , 
so i wouldn't know . 
i think i would be extremely jealous , or would have been , had there been another child in the family . 
it's , it's , we can see it work with her , 
it must be tough . 
she's frustrated . 
we , she , she's the middle one ? 
so she's never been the only one , 
so she really doesn't even know what it is to be the only one . 
that's tough , you know  . . . 
so , what do you , 
what's your opinion on the , our policy down there ? 
i don't think we have one . 
i didn't know we had one either .
i was going to say it's kind of hard to have , have an opinion . 
we seem to , uh , 
whoever screams the loudest 
i don't , 
the only thing that i pretty much know about is the central american policy where , you know , they're just trying to , you know , 
military action in panama is the only thing that comes to my mind right now , 
well , uh , 
and then , 
and then , of course , there was , there was the , uh , in columbia , with the drug lords . 
but we just talked a lot . 
we didn't actually do anything . 
well , that's , that's what i was about to say . 
i'm actually surprised at anything in central america , along with panama . 
i'm just kind of surprised we did that . 
but , uh , 
that is , that is pretty , uh , risky . 
but i guess they had to finally do something . 
actually bush has been better at that than i thought . 
he has a little more d , a little more of a stand on policy than i thought he would . 
i always considered him kind of a wimp . 
he takes more risks . 
reagan is kind of m , mushmouth . 
he was . 
but , but i guess most of the policy that we're using now is , uh , a combination of reagan and carter ,   much as , you know , policy makers . 
it seems that the , the policies more action than just words , than just rhetoric . 
 but , you know , if we , we back up what we s , what we say with actions . 
uh , yeah . 
we have so far , 
but w , we , r ,
i don't know ,
 of course , we really haven't taken on the drug lords , yet . 
i'd be interested to see if we do that . 
well , i don't think it's possible because , even though , you know , we're against them , i don't think we can go into another country and do something about the other country's problem . 
well , we did in panama . 
we did in ,
but see the thing when panama was , uh , the , that , uh , noriega was , uh , was , was , uh , was wanted fo , either the f b i , by the f b i , 
and therefore , they had a reason .
but , to go in and take out the whole drug kingdom would be something totally different because , 
it could be an interesting , interesting problem . 
i don't know if they could do it or not . 
did you read tom clancy's a clear and present danger ? 
uh , no . 
i think you need to pick that up and read it . 
it's quite , uh , it's , it's quite interesting . 
it addresses the problem . 
oh , the drug problem ? 
uhhuh . 
actually , he , he wrote that prior to the , uh , med , medellin cartel being exposed . 
it was on the stands prior to that time . 
it , it's quite timely . 
and either he knows somebody 
or he has a real good , a real good imagination 
because its , it hits pretty close to home . 
but i don't think we're going to have much of a choice in e , either central or south america . 
i don't think , uh , i don't think , the , the , uh , problem about drugs is going to be safe any time soon . 
i mean , you know , it , i think it pretty much got sidetracked with , uh , with the panama and , and with the c , cent ,   middle east problems . 
things that , that are important take precedent , precedence over the drugs , i think . 
i think , i think the big thing is trying to stop here on the home front .
and bef , 
you know , it , it'll take a little bit of time before they'll realize that this is failing , 
so they're going to have to go to the source . 
um , yeah . 
i think we realize it's failed . 
we just don't , we just don't , 
don't want to admit it yet . 
we still , there's still t , there's still too many kennedys and misinvolves and udalls all up there . 
yep ause . 
that's true . 
there's too many liberals in control . 
they can't agree on anything . 
and they have blinders on as far as the policy goes . 
as long as somebody's getting killed , as long as nobody knows about it it's okay . 
but , but the minute it hit , hits the paper then , of course , the kennedys and the misinvolves and the udalls and the , and , uh , the dawes from georgia , all stand up and scream and yell about what a horrible thing it is . 
of course , these are the same people that also drown blonde , the chappaquiddic , and stuff like that , you know . 
but i guess it automa , 
i guess it's automatic respective . 
depends on how much power you have ,
you know , 
and these are the people that make the foreign policy 
and it , it's probably basically , uh , 
i would not be surprised if the kennedy foundation or some of those don't have a lot of , uh , financial holdings in , in central and south america . 
considering the kennedys made all their money off bootleg whiskey anyway . 
every time you drink scotch , you're paying kennedys . 
i don't drink scotch . 
don't ever drink scotch , 
it's terrible . 
i quit drinking scotch when i found out about that , 
but , anyway . 
but , uh , as far as , as far as , you know , central and south america , we , our policy pretty much , uh , it depends on who we're , what government we're buying down there at the particular time . 
although we do need to do something about , you know , 
of course , in nicaragua and around there with the sandinistas and the contras , that's been going on for years . 
but then , hell , it's probably still be going on long after we're dead . 
it'll still be the same thing . 
those people down there don't really , 
i mean , 
i think it's going to have to get worse before it gets better , 
you know ,
well , i think basically , 
if you give everybody what they wanted there   is a complete democracy , those people wouldn't know how to react because they have no education . 
and they'll just pick crooked people again . 
and then people , the , the wrong people will just fight their way up to the top again , 
and it'll all ,
it's all tradition . 
they have to , 
you have the ruling class 
and you have everybody else . 
well , i guess that's about five minutes . 
appreciate talking ,
it was very pleasant . 
all righty . 
hey , what was that book , 
what was that book that you were saying to read ,
it's called a clear and present danger . 
a clear and present danger . 
he wri , he's the one who wrote , uh , red october , a hunt for red october . 
all right . 
and i think i , if you read that , i think you'll get a real kick out of it . 
all right . 
thanks a lot . 
all righty . 
one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education 
cause i went through the public , um , school system of boston , 
and , uh , i always felt that i graduated high school 
and i still didn't even i , i couldn't put together a map of the united state . 
you know what i mean . 
an yet i felt that i got a good education 
and i , i did well in school 
but you tell me to name , you know , five continents 
an i ,
i just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education , 
and the people are , are leaving school   not even knowing some common sense things . 
well , talking about public education , um , i'm , we're doing a proposal , 
it's , we're doing it at n c state , 
we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum , 
so that's kind of in a higher level .
so it's interesting that you chose that topic .
well , i went through private an until ninth grade . 
did you notice a big difference ? 
oh , yeah , 
like in what sense ? 
well , um , in , uh , public schools i guess there wer , there are a lot of , of , you know , 
people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing . 
but , um , private school you couldn't do that , 
you had to learn . 
i work in a temporary agency 
an they're people that come in , you know , every day to fill out an application , 
and they'll have to bring somebody with them , 
and they will show that they completed , um , four year of high school , 
yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application ,
that's bad . 
it's just incredible . 
our state cut a whole bunch of a , i think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget . 
so they're making all kind of cuts 
in college people cannot , i mean , the teachers can't make tests any more , 
and th , the library canceling all of it's subscriptions . 
it's pretty sorry . 
i know , 
um , they , uh , 
i forget 
i think it's , um , some place in new york because they're having budget problems ,
i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports ,
they're not cutting in any other corner 
they're closing the libraries . 
that to me shows a little , uh , switch in priorities . 
you know . 
so do you go to college right now ? 
are yo , 
you're a , so you're a senior now . 
i'm working on my projects trying to graduate .
oh , good for you . 
that's great , 
um , is , is n c university is that , uh , state , 
n c state . 
what did you say ? 
n c state , 
that's a state university then . 
i see . 
and you're from there also ? 
well , yeah , 
and then i lived in   ,
i see . 
and now i'm back here going to school . 
well , pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college . 
it's just a outrageously expensive . 
luckily state is one of the cheap ones . 
oh is it . 
well , still though 
i mean , you know , thousands of dollars , 
yeah , state's not that bad .
oh , well , that's good . 
i went to a private university 
and , um , i don't know 
i look back now 
and i , i think that i probably would have done it differently if i , um , you know , could do it over again . 
but , um , i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school , some , some of them , 
and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did . 
i really do 
and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say 
but , um , 
i don't know , 
where did you go ? 
i went to brandice university . 
it's in massachusetts . 
and , um , i really felt like i've been working now for about four years , 
and i , i feel like what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school . 
and i know that i'm drawing a lot of what i learned in school , you know , 
i , i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on , on art . 
but , um , i don't know 
my sister's a principal at a school , 
and one thing she's trying to instill in kids , um , besides just reading and writing are just some , the golden rules , 
she calls them just some basics about , um , you know , you don't take what's not yours , 
uh , and if you want to , you know , you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission . 
like no hitting , you know , 
no pulling hair or anything like that , 
and , uh , the school that she's in is a , um , it's basically for minorities , 
um , there's a large minority population . 
and , um , she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there 
i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get ,
that they , that they like pick on th , the advanced students and pay more attention to them ,
it's true . 
and i don't know if it makes them feel better 
i mean the do teachers get , 
i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful . 
and seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in , in areas and just watching them get better , you know . 
that's not much of a challenge . 
that's true . 
but ar , do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate . 
oh yeah . 
do you know where you're going ? 
where's that ? 
that's in chappel hill .
that's the name , 
oh is that north carolina ? 
oh , okay . 
never heard of the , uh , tarheels ? 
the a c c tarheels , u n c ? 
oh , uh , .
i don't get down there very often . 
they won the final four ,
oh , really , 
well the way i pick the final four was , um , by the state that had the warmest climate . 
so that's how i chose all mine , 
so you can tell that i really didn't have that much to do with any of it . 
so obviously you're into education . 
if you can be going , 
my husband went to , is in graduate school actually right now . 
and , uh , 
i don't know 
i give you a lot of credit . 
i couldn't do it , 
i know . 
i can't wait to graduate either ,
i know . 
i've got all of this stuff due 
i kind of know what you mean . 
well , it was really nice talking to you . 
all right . 
good luck . 
all right , 
thank you . 
all righty , 
take care . 
all right , 
[clanking {dishes .
well , as much as i'd , uh , i'd like to say that i'll be looking for a flashy convertible or , uh , or a four by four or something , 
i guess the next car i'll be looking for is a kind of a plain old four door .
 what kind of a car do you have now ? 
oh , we've got a , uh , an older delta eightyeight , 
and then , uh , our , our newer car is a , uh , a corsica . 
and we'll probably be looking for something about that , uh , that same style . 
that same kind of four door , hard top style . 
you got kids ? 
uh , no 
so , uh , in fact , uh , our oldsmobile is a , is a like an old delta eightyeight 
but it's in pretty good sh , in really good shape . 
and we've been really pleased with oldsmobiles . 
so that's probably where the first place we'd look . 
but , uh , 
well , we've always had , uh , fords . 
uh , mostly because my wife's stepfather works at a ford dealership .
that'll do it . 
um , but , yeah , we're , we're in the same shape . 
i think our next car will be a , you know , some big old four door , uh , something that can haul the kids to baseball practice 
and we've got a minivan , 
and that's great . 
and i d , drive , uh , 
well i used to drive an escort , 
but it died on me . 
so i , i mean i , i , i used to run it , i , uh , where we used to live , i used to commute a hundred and forty miles a day . 
oh , geez . 
and , uh , and this escort took it all . 
and it , it , it got up to , uh , uh , i was at ninetyfour thousand miles on it , 
and the engine just went . 
so i , i , i bought a used , uh , dodge aries ,
i , i mean i've haven't had it that long . 
but it , it al , it's an eightyfive aries , 
but it only had thirtyfour thousand miles on it when i bought it . 
oh , geez . 
and i just , you know , i just drive it to work . 
so it's just a ten minute commute every day . 
so , uh , it doesn't get much of , uh , 
i mean , it's not like i'm putting it through its paces . 
but i think , uh , 
and it's a four door which is nice , 
but it's still a little cramped . 
i've got three kids , 
so i , i , 
sounds like you , you need at least like a taurus size ,
that's what ,
was a taurus . 
i , i know a lot of guys at work , 
they , uh , the ones that have , uh , families , uh , 
and they still want kind of a sports car . 
they've been , uh , a lot of them have been getting these taurus s h o's . 
that i guess it's the sports version 
oh , really ? 
in fact , it comes with a standard stick 
and , uh ,
and it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that . 
but , uh , 
and usually they're in like black ,
you're not going to see too many , uh , you know , green ones or blue ones or anything like that . 
they , they put them in sporty colors i guess . 
but , uh , 
well , my wife wants a miyata . 
oh , well sure .
that's what , you know , 
until , until you look at the price tag 
what would i , besides tooling around and looking really cool 
i know , 
i know . 
it's like i , i guess i could fit in it  ,
i had an old car that i bought just to get to , to my j , my first job . 
and when i got there , the first thing i did was trade it in on a spitfire . 
and i , i knew that was going to be the only time i could afford a two seater , uh , sports car . 
but that , that just does not make it as an only car . 
it's , uh , it's like i , i would , 
i bought a set of stereo speakers 
and it was one of those cash and carry deals . 
i had to take them one at a time ,
and it was winter , so i was in like this coat 
oh , no! 
and the speaker in the passenger seat . 
and i drove that one home , 
and then i went back and got the other one and put that in the ,
and , uh , funny , funniest sight . 
and da , you kind of outgrow that real quick 
well , i , 
you know , it's funny . 
most people that i've talked to did stuff like that when they were in college ,
they'd , they'd buy themselves a sporty car because it was their last . 
i never did that . 
uh , you know , my first car was a toyota corolla . 
oh , really ? 
and , uh , because i got a good deal on it 
and , uh , that was a great little car . 
actually i met , 
that's how i met girls was , i'd find out if a girl could drive a manual transmission , which i , i had never , 
i , i'd learned on an automatic transmission .
boy , that's a good deal . 
and , uh , in fact i married one of those people .
ah , okay . 
well , i'll have to remember that if i ever get in 
and it worked . 
because i , i know we've , uh , 
that's , that's something that , that we definitely have to go with is an automatic transmission . 
my , uh , my wife just does , can't , can't , uh , 
she really doesn't want to learn i guess ,
i fact , i , i remember once we , uh , we , uh , went , uh , went on a , uh , test drive . 
we got one of these things from lee iacocca that said , you know , i'll give you a fifty dollar savings bond if you'll 
and we went , uh , we went , uh , we went to a dealership 
and , uh , it , it was prev , she , she did pretty well . 
but it was one of those things where we just went to a big parking lot 
and the , uh , dealer kind of gave her standard shift parking , 
because that was all it was . 
it was , it was the funniest thing , 
it was like , uh ,
it was a le baron with everything on it , 
but it had a standard shift . 
it was the 
that's weird! 
and , and , and that's probably why they were trying to sell them , i guess . 
and , uh , we just kind of went back and forth and back and forth . 
she did pretty well after a while . 
but , uh , it's just kind of hard to learn , i guess . 
well , my wife , 
i mean , she'd always driven standard transmission . 
and , uh , and , 
in fact all our earlier cars were a standard transmission . 
in fact , the minivan's a , has a stick shift . 
um , okay . 
and in , 
this dodge aries is the first car we've ever gotten that had anything . 
you know , it's got automatic transmission , cruise control ,
oh , geez . 
you know , it's like , it's like a luxury car except that it's the dodge aries  ,
so , uh , 
oh , well . 
well , i guess that's , i guess that's about all i've got to say ,
well , you , um , 
the , the thing about this , uh , th , 
i will say this about the minivan . 
we thought that was a luxury car when we bought it . 
i would think so , 
it , it , 
because it's so big . 
and , and it was quiet , 
it had a stereo system . 
oh , yeah . 
we never had it , you know , 
we always had the a m radio . 
and , uh , of course this has , this   that had s , speakers that you can control from the back seat . 
and you can change the channels on the , on the radio from the back seat too .
and put s , speaker phones in it . 
now , now , now that used to be a luxury , 
but i bet on the next time you buy a car , that's going to be mandatory . 
you've got to have that now . 
that's right . 
you're used to it 
and you got to have it . 
and you've got to pay for it too . 
that's true too . 
and i bet , and i bet it costs twice as much as , as when 
but , uh , 
oh , well . 
well , bill it's been nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
you have a good evening . 
thanks a lot . 
what kind , h , 
what kind of cars do you , do you usually drive ? 
right now we , i've got a , uh , four year old subaru and a two year old honda . 
oh , my goodness . 
well , we're , we're , we're sort of , sort of a general motors family , 
i guess that's the way we were raised . 
and , uh , uh , we were overseas with t i for a number of years 
and when we came back we suddenly find out we've got five licensed drivers in the family . 
oh , goodness . 
and four cars 
and we bought some year old cars from national car rental . 
at least two of them . 
we bought an olds calais and a buick skylark . 
uh , for , you know , 
they each had twentyone thousand miles or something like that . 
turns out that's a pretty good place to buy cars because they maintain them 
and they can show you the records they've gotten all their maintenance on schedule and everything like that . 
uh , then we've got an eightysix chevy spectrum that we bought new . 
my daughter was a freshman in college when we bought it for her . 
and we've got a eightyfour toyota that we bought used . 
so we've got four cars for our five licensed drivers . 
it's like musical chairs .
i bet . 
you're one short . 
and , uh , 
but you know , it's interesting the two , 
even though my dad was a chevrolet man forever and ever and ever 
and we were in the retail milk business 
and he had all chevrolet milk trucks 
and , and we bought automobiles and all that , 
it was almost like 
and a chevrolet dealer was our friend 
and it was almost like the minute we got old and bought anything like a , but a chevrolet it would be like going and spitting on his grave .
but , uh , 
as we got older and got away , 
and then we thought , well , you know , you still could buy general motors products 
and it was probably not that bad . 
but , uh , we lived in malaysia for t i in nineteen , uh , eightyone , two , three , and four . 
and , and , of course you don't buy general motors products over there .
but we bought a volvo 
and i have never had a car that i've loved more . 
i just can't afford them here . 
uh , but i , i just loved that car . 
and , uh , we bought a , uh , 
we lived in the philippines for t i in eightyfive , eightysix , and eightyseven 
and we bought a , uh , ford telstar , 
which is somewhat similar to the taurus . 
it's sold in , uh , in uh , the far eastern coun , uh , far east countries more than here . 
but we really liked that . 
and have you had experience with cars other than the ones you have ? 
well , yeah 
we had , uh , we had , 
these are the first cars that my husband and i have ever purchased ourselves . 
the others were hand me downs through the families . 
and those were always g m cars . 
uh , buicks and chevrolets . 
and , uh , we were real happy with them , 
but all the ones that we ever had were the , you know , eight cylinder , 
oh , yeah . 
really rugged ,
the b , the big , 
and all we had heard was , was a lot of negative press about the smaller cars , 
and we both drive , well , fortyfive miles round trip every day . 
and so we wanted a smaller car , 
when we got ready to buy , we needed a smaller car to get better gas mileage 
and quite frankly , we were afraid of the , of the g m small cars . 
you know , as far as durability . 
so we kind of , 
when we had our larger cars , we didn't mind , uh , keeping them up , 
you know , doing the maintenance and everything on them as long as we didn't have to do it very often . 
but , once they got over a hundred thousand miles on them , all of them , you know , 
it just kind of seemed to be the magic number for them .
it seems that something goes every month . 
and i'm afraid we're going to be in that in another year with all of ours , 
you know , 
we got three eightysixes and an eightyfour .
and we'll probably be there with all of them . 
you know , it's the same thing , you know , 
i don't know whether , uh , you classify the skylark and the calais as , 
well i guess they're intermediate . 
uh , but , uh , we went on a family trip to massachusetts 
and there were five of us 
and five , five of us never go anywhere together here . 
every , everybody's heading off in their own direction . 
and i rented a buick le sabre , 
and it's the first big car i had since i had my nine passenger impala station wagon from seventysix to eighty . 
and it made all the , 
i , i had forgotten what driving a big car was like . 
it's like a yacht . 
it was just nice . 
it floated . 
we , we sold or we , we traded in our le sabre for our subaru . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah , 
it was a great car . 
it just , 
we ran the wheels right off of it . 
and , uh , you know i've read , 
i'm in the quality business at t i , 
i'm a quality manager 
and we're , we're uh , we deal , 
we sell , 
i'm in the semiconductor group 
and we sell to , uh , ford , chrysler and g m , uh , g m delco . 
and there is a , amazing , 
i am just , uh , really impressed with the , with the quality consciousness that the , tho , these companies have put into their procurement 
and it's , i , it's come out as a result of the competition from the japanese . 
and , uh , uh , i 
and , you know , we used to think ford products were tinny . 
i mean i was growing up , 
i was taught when i was growing up , you know , that , that  , that real people bought general motors products , 
and peons bought ,
that's right . 
but just with the quality requirements that ford is putting on us and the way they come into our plants 
and they're really , uh , uh , stressing this partnerships in quality , 
and you know , g m and chrysler are doing that , 
but i really think ford's got a leadersi , ship position in this right now . 
and i think it's showing up in their automobiles . 
their automobiles are getting a very good quality reputation right now . 
and , uh , uh , we went to , uh , austin a while back to a basketball tournament 
and we were going to be meeting some of my wife's relatives down there , 
so we decided rather than drive one of our cars down , we'd rent one , 
and we went up to the local budget 
and we were going to get a olds eightyeight or something . 
and we drove that down 
and i hated to turn that back in . 
we had that for three days . 
and i absolutely loved , 
except i couldn't want to have to park it in tight places all the time . 
i wouldn't want to have to pay for the gas , either . 
but i absolutely loved that automobile . 
and , you know , it wasn't that i'd , 
driving around down there we might have got sixteen to eighteen miles per gallon , 
but on the trip down and back i filled up both coming and going 
so i knew what i actually got on the trip 
and it was about twentyfour miles a gallon . 
uh , and , you know , we just got it out on the highway and put it in cruise control at about sixty and let it , let it float . 
and , it was pretty nice . 
are , are ,
oh , yours is small . 
so , we , uh , so we don't plan on purchasing any more any time soon . 
both of our cars are getting ,
oh , yeah . 
we drive a lot . 
you got another , another thirty or forty thousand if you maintain them . 
uh , we've got , 
probably we'll get something in the next couple years . 
my son will graduate from high school this year , 
and , and he's going to go to richland college one year behind us , 
it's right , 
in fact , uh , our house is adjacent to the richland property . 
he wants to go to texas tech 
and he's probably going to have to go to richland a year to get some grades in order , 
but , uh , the next year when he goes out to tech , he wants a pickup , 
and i want ,
a pickup {faint . 
i may get one and not let him have it .
but , we have been looking at these red chevro , 
they , they're very popular around here . 
these , uh , uh , red chevy pickups , 
and , uh , we'll probably do something like that , 
uh , uh , incidentally , 
uh , uh , i don't know , 
uh , the , uh , the credit union has got a deal now where you decide what you want 
and you call this number 
and , uh , they go negotiate the price for you . 
and , and , or , or send you to a guy with whom they've already got a deal 
and , uh , my boss just bought a chevy pickup 
and he got three thousand dollars off the sticker price doing it this way . 
and , uh , uh , you know , you , you figure out the options , go around look at the dealers and get the best price you can and then go call this guy and , and tell him what you want 
and he'll put you in touch with a certain guy , a certain person at that dealer's place . 
so i'm going to try that the next time i buy one . 
i think that would be a good idea . 
and , and , so , you know , i can go around and comparison shop and see if i can get a better negotiation on my own . 
but , once , one thing that's a pain in the neck buying automobiles is negotiating . 
this is the car we want , 
will you sell me this car for that price . 
and for that price . 
and , and we've had 
we , with our , 
we'll go somewhere else . 
you know . 
and , uh , and i , i think that's probably the way you've got to do it . 
when , when i was young , i went in and bought a , uh , or made a deal on a sixty , 
this is nineteen sixty , 
i'd first come to texas , and made a deal on a sixty red impala convertible 
and this guy gave me this deal , you know , 
i told him how much i wanted to pay , 
and for every fifty dollars he'd have to go in and check with the boss 
and then i'd have to sign something saying that if he could get this rate , uh , we would go ahead and buy . 
uh , uh , if he could get this rate i promised to buy 
and i left there on a saturday afternoon just totally exhausted . 
i , i was only twentyfive years old or something 
i , i left there 
and i , i , uh , i'd never done this before because i'd always bought my previous cars from the guy my dad bought his milk trucks from , 
and , uh , uh , so i , i got back 
and a salesman that lived in the apartment had , asked me , uh , uh , if , 
he'd heard i was going to get a car , and asked me what i paid for it . 
there was a guy that owned a chevrolet dealership up there . 
and i called the guy and made an appointment to come up monday morning 
and just driving fifty miles out of town , it was a difference , 
and , i mean it was a difference of four hundred dollars , 
but this was four hundred dollars on only twentyfive hundred , 
is all we paid for cars in those days . 
and , uh , uh , so i called back the guy in dallas 
and i told him that , 
i'd left him a check for tax , title and license and everything , 
and i told him , 
that's right . 
and , uh , uh , and i , i find that , uh , 
and for the longest time then i drove up to will's point 
and , and the , and the fellow died since then , 
and , and some of his relatives have taken over the business 
and that , 
and , since then i had  . . . 
we do have pollution in houston 
and it , 
how bad is it ? 
do you have smog like they do in california ? 
well it , it 
i think it depends on , uh , you know , what the , ho , the cloud cover 
and like right now , it's , uh , it's kind of overcast , you know , 
just , it's hot , 
and the sun is trying , tries to shine through 
but it's , it's holding in this , this pollution 
and i , 
it depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion , i take it . 
i think so , 
and , uh , 
and we have , uh , pasadena , texas which is sort of between here an , you know , heading toward galveston , 
i mean it's still part of , it's part of the houston metroplex . 
what do you think is your primary cause of it . 
well , i think it's industry 
and i think it's cars . 
you do ? 
you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas ? 
i don't , i , 
well maybe not , 
but , it , it sure , it sure , se , 
you know , it , 
i , i know that when i'm , when i'm behind a car 
and , uh , sometimes , uh , i can really smell especially diesel and things like that , 
you know , comes right into my air conditioner 
and , you know , my head and my fa , 
i'm so stopped up right now , 
my goodness . 
i don't know if it's , uh , if it's partly from what's blooming , you know , right now , pollen and stuff like that , 
that's part of it , 
but , um . 
i think a lot of it's industrial . 
i also think , uh , that , uh , there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles 
but it's mostly from older automobiles . 
i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting , uh , frankly . 
i think that , uh , i think that , uh , uh , 
if , uh , 
i , i , i heard a story a while back 
something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent , or , take all the cars off the road that have been , uh , manufactured say before nineteen seventyfive ,
you mean , uh , fifty percent pollution total 
from , from cars 
that is , not , not total but just from cars , 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , that i think would be tremendous help . 
but i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical 
and it just keeps getting , uh , gives me good service 
and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money . 
on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have . 
but i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies . 
and , uh , that may be part of the problem . 
do you all have pollution in your co , part of the country , uh , from industry ? 
yeah , {pause 
it's , it's , uh , pretty heavy up here i think 
but i think it's mostly industrial , is what i really , uh , believe is the , the main problem . 
and , and , uh , {pause 
and , uh , uh , people , uh , i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should . 
i , i we , we seem to have a high , uh , cancer rate up here in maryland . 
and , uh , 
like what ki , 
well , for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant 
and , uh , i think , 
of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody , 
but , uh , th , this state was like the second , 
my wife's a registered nurse , 
and i think this state was like second this year from the top , in terms of , uh , cancer rate for just all kinds . 
and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution . 
i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is , 
but i just can't believe it is . 
now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph , uh , fluorocarbons which is the , like freon twelve and freon twentytwo . 
they use freon twentytwo in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps , 
and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners 
and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer . 
and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer , that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also , 
and having all kinds of effects , 
well what can we do about the , the , the , the air conditioning problem ? 
well they're working now , 
i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working , uh , feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons , 
and who ever does is going to make , uh , a mint . 
because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons , then , uh , 
is that also what's in , uh , hairsp , aerosol ? 
but they made them take it out of that . 
even , so , so the aerosol is still aerosol , 
but it doesn't have anything that's damaging . 
well that's good . 
and that was a move in the right direction . 
we are doing some things to try to correct the problem . 
but there are more things we could do 
and getting rid of old cars , like i said is one way to help correct the problem . 
uh , uh , just trying to i think be careful , uh , with the way you handle garbage , 
i notice in this state , 
i don't know if you're doing it in texas yet or not , 
but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces , uh , you know , containers in , 
here , they've just started , started doing that , 
it's , it's , you know , 
you're not , you don't have to , 
but m , you know , 
i know i am . 
i save , 
well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too . 
but they , uh , 
in one of the counties here , they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police . 
they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid 
and she spot checks people's trash . 
no kidding , 
and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash ,
is that right . 
well , we need to do something , 
we need to get serious about it . 
you've got to get people to see i , 
and surprisingly enough just handling of trash , uh , can cut pollution , uh , from , uh , uh , from just throwing it in a dump , or , or , or , where ever else they used to do with it , maybe used to burn it . 
they've stopped that up here too . 
but that , that will cut pollution too . 
because you get a lot of out gassing from these things , i think , decaying and tr , and trying to , 
for instance cans and bottles , they never go away at all . 
but on , on the other hand , i don't guess they're polluting . 
but plastic containers and the like , uh , they may be , 
i'm not sure of that . 
how much does , uh , planting more trees and things like that help ? 
oh i think that's very important to do . 
i , i really think that , uh , trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very , very important thing . 
and , uh , that can help to cut pollution , i guess some . 
i , i don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air . 
i would hope that they would help some , though . 
that's for sure . 
i think , uh , it seems like there was something going on , around here , that , you know , 
we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff , 
and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out , you know , like in the middle of the night , they would go ahead and do it anyway . 
i think they got caught . 
oh good . 
but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff , you know , goes on . 
well that , uh , that i think may go on a lot 
and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said , somebody happened to stay up late at night or something . 
i don't think we have a adequate policing , uh , particularly on industry . 
uh , we have good policing , at least in this state and , and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too , of car pollutants 
because we have to go down , uh , once a year here in maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content . 
uh , we have to , uh , we have to have a state inspection every year . 
do you all have that ? 
uh , no , 
which i , 
i don , 
i would assu , 
but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state . 
so i'm assu , i'm assuming that , you know , they check , they check everything for safety 
i don't know , 
uh , that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities . 
but in this state we have to , uh , pay eight dollars and a half and go to a , an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are , have been made starting in nineteen seventythree . 
but that's all they check for , 
they don't check how good , 
if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough . 
now , i'm in maryland , 
in virginia they check that every two years , i think . 
we do that ev , every year . 
and i think that's a good idea too , 
not , no , not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily , 
but i think it's a good idea . 
the emission check , though , is required in maryland 
and it's also required in virginia , uh , a sister state to , to this one . 
and that's , that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants . 
well i'll have to check , 
i'm not sure if , if our state inspection ever , 
once a year has to do , you know , 
if they check the , uh , 
well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get a law with . i , get around to it , 
and if they don't then that's something i would certainly , uh , uh , suggest you be willing to uh , uh , be for in terms of , uh , 
oh , i would .
i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or , or , or anything . 
oh yeah , 
i , i agree . 
now that's another area we haven't even discussed 
and that is water pollution and various of the other types of , uh , of , uh , like food pollution . 
i mean you , you hardly ever hear , hear anybody say anything about food pollution . 
but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries , 
so , uh , hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of , uh , pollutants in our food . 
but water pollution , uh , 
i've worried , especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like . 
i know a lot more people are going to bottled water . 
and that's not necessarily the answer either 
because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap . 
tap , 
but a lot of these , uh , 
some of this 
well , you know , a lot of people have well water , 
in fact in this area too 
and , an , you know , 
and , uh , 
if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're , what you're drinking 
and i , i know a lot of people , you know , have that 
and , you know , you have to wonder if that , you know could have an adverse affect on them too ,
i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course , have it checked 
because it seems , uh , 
when i was a kid growing up down south , uh , i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were 
and we had a well , 
it was one of those draws that , 
i forget what you call those things , 
and , and that was some of the best tasting water , 
i mean , i can still to this day taste that water . 
when we were , 
when i was growing up i lived in huntsville , alabama , 
and their water supply came from , uh , spring . 
and it was like ice cold , spring water 
and i guess parts of the , the city still ha , you know , get that , 
but , uh , that was , that was really wonderful . 
oh , i bet it was . 
it was really , really good . 
once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well , filtered through all the earth and everything i think that , uh , 
it depends of course where you are . 
a good well , though , i think is very healthy  . . . 
the latin american situation in , 
the last development i know of was the military and financial assistance columbia 
and i support that fully . 
i'm not sure we have the right solution to it , 
but at least we're , we're going to the source of the problem . 
uh , the problem is here , 
but the source of supply is there . 
that's true . 
very definitely so . 
in fact i think a lot of the , 
i've been to , uh , peru several times . 
i've never been to other parts of south america , 
but , uh , i have been to peru , 
and they need some assistance down there 
and i'm sure that , uh , as an undeveloped country they look , look for it , 
very immature in that 
and i , i think that , uh , they need guidance and assistance , 
but they need to learn how to stand on their own , own two feet also . 
i agree . 
i think that for so long power financially , uh , governmentally , every which way was in the hands of such a few 
oh , no , the , and the poor are extremely poor . 
i know , 
are extremely poor . 
that's correct . 
i know , uh , some of the areas in , in texas seem poor , 
but until you've seen some of those , uh , native ,
and , uh , the worst scene i've ever had i think was , uh , someone eating out of , out of a garbage can on the streets in lima , peru . 
and , and just very happy to get that . 
oh , yes . 
i have a brother who spent two years in bolivia . 
and this is very much his , you know , reaction that the rich are so rich and the poor are so poor . 
oh , the , there's a joke , 
the , the graft and the , uh , payoffs down there are  , are an accepted way 
and , in a way , 
and there's , there's a sad joke . 
i guess all jokes are really sad , 
but there's a joke about the , uh , ambassador from latin america that came to visit a senator in the u s and was taken to his home for dinner 
and the , uh , home was palatial . 
they had five or six servants , you know , and , and , a lot of expensive , uh , holdings and all that , 
how can you afford all of this ? 
and he walked out in the backyard 
and he patted his pocket 
 oh , gosh . 
so the next year the senator went to latin america to visit the ambassador and was treated to dinner in his home 
and it was twice as large and four times as many servants . 
how can you afford this , uh , in such a poor country , 
and he walked out the backyard 
and the senator looked 
and he couldn't see anything , 
it's a sad story 
but it , uh , it is a problem . 
i know . 
uh , i have a sisterinlaw who is from nicaragua 
and her family , 
her father was a fairly , uh , high ranking official under somoza . 
and when that went down the tubes they had to get out . 
and seventeen children ,
you know , two here , three there , one here , you know , this kind of thing until , 
and now , uh , couple of the older ones stayed or went back , 
but the rest of them now have their american citizenship and are leading productive lives , 
but , you kn , 
well , the oth , the other instance i think of their inability to , to handle things , the cholera ,
and it shows the , the unpreparedness for such , such a problem . 
and yet they're so , 
oh , the stories she tells , you know , are just unnerving 
and they're , they're so rich in resources there . 
they're very rich in oil and gas . 
and they're very rich in gold and silver , and very rich in , in , uh , natural resources such as the fish and , uh 
but they , 
and the uranium . 
but they don't have , 
it's sort of like russia , 
they don't have the ability to develop it . 
the technology . 
and they , they're very , 
and , you know , they're very willing to be taught in many cases now , too , 
but , you know , there's just always this kind of resentment underlying 
i think that when they receive help from us , they want it , 
but , they don't want it , i mean  , 
it's kind of a 
it , it's sort of illustrated by the , uh , world bank and international monetary fund not wanting to continue to do business there 
because they offer assistance , then don't get repaid . 
so it's sort of a thumbing of the nose , uh , approach . 
they need it , 
and they need to live up to certain regulations and expectations , 
but uh , then don't . 
of course it's a very volatile government , uh , situation , too . 
and i think that , you know , it , 
somewhat a sarcastic view , 
but some of those drugs czars , you know , 
they , they know that by pumping that poison into our system 
you know , 
you know , that's really , uh , kind of a far fetched idea , 
i know , 
and i don't think people probably think those things consciously , 
but it's like in any sibling rivalry 
well the , 
we're hearing the same , 
the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the g , the u s government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to , to beef up the military and to do all other things . 
i think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it , 
which would still give the , uh , the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the , uh , the money that they apparently need and go , go to the illegal crop for . 
and it would save the u s money in 
in the long run . 
and in the short run probably  , too . 
course , then could , you know , at , at some point , could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind . 
you know . 
and , i , i think finding an alternate to that would be very good . 
i mean even their , even their legal crops are things that we don't perceive as being healthy now from a medical standpoint of view , coffee 
argentine beef , 
they're certainly legal , 
but they're certainly not healthy . 
well , have we come up with a solution yet , salina ? 
but it's been fun hashing about it i suppose . 
at any rate , 
yeah , 
well , one of these days , uh , i hope we'll find some , some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones . 
well , let's just hope that the powers that be , uh , have time to , a little bit once in a while to , to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and i do here tonight 
i agree . 
well , it's been nice chatting with you . 
it has . 
i appreciate it , 
and , and tell your wife i hope we , i get her again sometime , too . 
this is fun , 
very good .
it's kind of nice to , to see old friends now , you see . 
all right , 
thank you salina . 
bye now . 
gun control seems to be a rather , uh , timely topic , with all that's going on legislation wise . 
and , uh , [the , the interesting scale that they assigned it , uh , the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free .
i'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle , i guess . 
[i , i don't mind regulating [all of the , the guns 
and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types . 
now [the , the wisdom as to which types , that's going to be a debate forever , i would assume . 
uh , the method [of , of controlling it , well that's all into how much money you want to put into [the , the controls . 
uh , one point that was made in the house hearings 
but , uh , we don't want to check his background , 
and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes 
but there still , [the , the technology exists [to , to check it if they want . 
so , [it's , it's kind of a , 
i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that . 
and then you've got the group of people that decide that [there's , there's no particular reason to have them at all 
and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it 
and i guess i would fall more in [the , the realm that i like the sport issue of it , 
but [i , i could give it up without too much trouble , 
not the world's most pleasurable thing 
and it costs a bit to do [it , 
uh , i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years , 
but it's just not like golf or whatever . 
i mean there are other things that you could go do . 
so , uh , [i , i don't see [the , the joy of shooting [as , as that much of a driving factor . 
i think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt , 
i don't even keep the gun in our house , 
so i don't have that problem , 
but , uh , 
it's a hard , hard topic , i guess . 
a lot of people have a hard issue , a lot of hard feelings about it . 
they do , 
and [you , boy you can get them on either side 
and just like you say , 
uh , well [[i think [i , i guess i'd have to place myself , uh , probably seven or eight  , 
or not , 
[[w , w , onto no control , 
i'm sorry , excuse me , that , 
uh , two or three . 
i was going the wrong direction . 
uh , because of , we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child 
and the father kept the bullets in a separate place , 
but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to , 
uh , he knew where [booth , both places were , loaded the gun 
and they were playing cowboys and indians 
and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes . 
so , uh , 
i mean it , 
it destroyed two families 
a lot of people say that they need it for protection , uh , 
having worked at one time in baltimore , 
i don't know if you're in the big city , 
are you , 
that's a big city .
uh , then you know that , uh , uh , 
if you live anywhere real close that , uh , 
the safety is , uh , 
some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and , you know . 
but , uh , uh , we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up . 
uh , i , uh , 
once , uh , uh , knew a fellow that had , had been a policeman 
and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber , he's going to assume that you know how to use it well , 
and he's going to , you know , try to shoot first . 
uh , so , you know , if he's got one . 
uh , and if not , 
uh , then usually they , uh , 
if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you , 
i mean , you know 
he said that [it , it was better not to have , 
especially myself , now i'm a widow , 
and , uh , 
[[i , so i'm , when my handicapped son [is , is not at home , i'm by myself , 
but , uh , there's , 
i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really .
about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that [the , the , person was coming your way . 
once you're surprised , it's too late . 
that's right . 
and , and the rare ,
you know , the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming , 
and had time to do anything about it . 
that's right . 
and , i don't have that problem , 
as i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one . 
[in the , uh , n r as , uh , claim that the , uh , the constitutional , the right to bear arms and that whole statement , uh , 
it's hard to know the original intent , 
but [i , i don't see it as that , that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that , uh , yeah , it's the right to , to arm a militia [and , as opposed to just the general public . 
and [you have a , you have a earn a right , 
not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia , 
then you have a right to have that arm , 
but , uh , 
that's right . 
you know , there's all sorts of arguments there 
i know .
 but , i don't even want to worry about what the original intent was , 
they didn't have this problem back then .
that's true . 
so , we change our rights with our social status . 
they're man given rights 
and they can be taken away by a man , 
 uh , the people that hide behind that , i don't worry about . 
they can go live in another country if they want . 
well , yeah , 
that's how i feel , too . 
i know , well , 
[e , even here where i work , uh , we have [a , a gun club . 
and , of course , those people are very avid . 
[they , you know ,
that it's not , 
but i can't see why any , uh , o , on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun . 
uh , you know , when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide , 
but there are a few guns that , uh , just are not , uh , sport , 
or , i mean , 
i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either .
so , uh , [i , i think they should have at least some control over , over those things . 
uh , and when you were speaking about how they can check up , you know , on credit cards , 
well , [i , i understand about the privacy act and everything , 
but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not . 
that , to me , would not be an unreasonable thing . 
and if they do , 
course the argument with the people in the gun club , uh , is that , uh , well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway . 
and so , it's not going to be that they're buying them . 
course , some of them do . 
so it , it is a hard question .
tends to , tends to strap only the legitimate people . 
most regulation does  , 
oh , yeah . 
and , most , 
it's very difficult to , uh , legislate , uh , crooks or [whatever you want , however you want to word it 
that's right . 
 so it's , 
well , this may be a never ending topic . 
i got a couple of calls waiting on me , 
so i'd better let you go . 
well thanks for talking . 
okay , bye . 
byebye now . 
uh , our children are both , uh , basically adults . 
they , we've , we've got two . 
uh , one is twentyone , 
and one is twentyfive . 
and they , they still live at home . 
well , that's , that's a little unusual for , uh , for children of that age , to have both of them that age at home . 
but , uh , i guess the activities that , uh , we have with them are , uh , pretty few and far between . 
actually the , they're both going on their own most of the time . 
so , uh , most of our activities are , you know , just discussion type things about what's going on in the family and what they're doing and 
well , we have a , uh , three year old and a one year old . 
and , uh , so you know it keeps us pretty busy as you know . 
sure it does . 
and , uh , most of the time with a three year old we're trying to , to get him , uh , 
well , we play usually in the evening when , when i get home , you know , about five o'clock or so until about eight , you know , with the exception of dinner . 
out in the front or backyard playing like , uh , tee ball off the , you know , off the ball and let him hit a lot of baseball . 
uh , since we just got here we got the , uh , uh , new two wheel bike with training wheels on it for him , 
and he really likes riding that around . 
oh , yeah . 
so , you know , 
and trying to supervisor him with that and everything and , uh , playing squirt guns and all that , 
he really likes that . 
and , uh , the one year old just kind of follows along and does everything , 
trying to do everything he does . 
is the one year old a boy ? 
a girl ? 
ours , uh , the older one is a girl , 
and the , and the younger one is a boy , 
uh , i guess , uh , what i see is so far as , uh , the trends , uh , uh , for children , uh , 
i don't know what kind of a area virginia beach is , 
but , of course , uh , richardson is in the dallas area . 
and i think , uh , the big city , uh , 
activities for , for children now are , 
they're good 
but there's so much , uh , potential danger , you know , 
that you really have to watch your children so closely now 
i , i'm from a smaller town in east texas . 
and i could , you know , go and do whatever , pretty much whatever i wanted to do ,
uh , you know , i never , never had to worry about the bad guys being out there . 
and , uh , you know , i find it's , it's quite a bit different now 
that , uh , you know , you have to watch your children so closely and , uh , keep up with them . 
i , i feel like , uh , 
that it's , it's really a sad commentary on , uh , you know , a life in general , 
that , uh , you know that children can't , cannot be allowed to grow up , uh , you know , without really close supervision . 
well , i , i agree with that , 
and i seem , i seem to feel the same way , you know , 
even just when i grew up and everything . 
and , and , the way it is now you get a lot of supervision is , is at hand and everything . 
uh , the only other thing i have noticed though is that , uh , it seems that there's been a lot of or more empha , emphasis at least in what we've been dealing with 
and , and the looking , you know , 
just start not even , 
not really looking for a school for him but , uh , like a preschool or something that where he would go maybe a couple hours a couple days a week or something . 
for , for a three year old it's that , uh , 
there's a lot of emphasis on , on , on , on education and what these children should know before they reach kindergarten . 
and , and it seems like it's a lot more than the , they need to know and be able to do than when we are the , when i had to go in t , ki , kindergarten . 
and it seems like it's more , uh , 
you know , i don't know . 
they're expecting more or , uh , or just , uh , you know , 
kids just because of the computer age or whatever , it just , know more when they get , you know , to be five or six or something . 
um , i guess looking at , uh , back at , at what our children did compared to what , uh , you know , what i had to go through in school . 
the , uh , there i , there does seem to be a lot more in the curriculum . 
it's a lot more complicated . 
a lot more available , of course . 
but , uh , this , 
  so much more to learn now that it really makes it more difficult , i would think . 
i , i would probably have a hard time getting through school myself . 
uh , you know , just , 
or at least it would be a lot harder than it was when i went to school . 
one thing is i got a home computer too 
and , uh , i play , uh , with the three year old 
i play some computer games and stuff with him . 
educational games like , you know , concentration type games ,
and , uh , he's , he really likes it 
and , uh , and i think it's important because i think that , uh , you know , it gives him the interaction with the computer 
because it sure looks like that's going to be you , you know , the big thing for a long time . 
and given ,
i think , uh , 
and he seems to enjoy it . 
ery faint oh . 
and , uh , of course , the one year old hasn't , hasn't gotten there yet 
but , uh , 
and the other thing we try to do is , uh , since the summer's time's here is , uh , sign him up for , and her , for , uh , different activities at like the rec center or something like swimming , 
you know , uh , 
there's a little soccer thing that he's going to do for a week or so 
and , uh , you know , 
where they go for an hour or so . 
and , uh , 
because , uh , when he was a baby that we did the swimming too 
and he really liked it 
so we're going to do that with our daughter too . 
that , uh , uh , watching a little , little boys play soccer is , is more fun . 
i can't imagine th , them having as much fun as the parents ,
i know . 
well , we were just talking about that too . 
and i guess it's not really soccer it's just kind of a , well , kick the ball around for a while ,
the , the disorganized play   really what it was , 
when ours was a , 
i guess he was probably five or six , you know , when he first started playing soccer . 
and , uh , and that was , that was more fun to watch those boys trying to , trying to kick the ball up and down the field . 
but , uh , 
and it's , 
i guess , that was , you know , as important , uh , as much important to the parents as it was to the children that , uh , you know , to get out and watch the kids play , 
i guess one of the things that i think about is a , talking about education , uh , i kind of feel like , uh , that , uh , the , the school systems in this , particularly in this area , the systems are not under enough control . 
the , the students have a little too much , uh , too much leeway . 
excuse me . 
um , an , an , and the , and that's kind of contradictory to what i said 
but , you know , you , 
the , hell 
you have to be under control so much when they're out 
but when they're in school they , they don't have quite , quite as much control ,
uh , uh , i kind of feel like there's , there's too much allowed to go on in at , at school . 
and , uh , you know , it tends to , uh , to encourage students to not be as , you know , to not concentrate as much on the education . 
you know , they're , they're there for a good time . 
and , you know , to , to see how little they can get by with . 
well , i know of number of people that are in the , in the , uh , school district an , down in , in , uh , san antonio . 
and , uh , it seems like it's , 
a lot of the problem is to , you know , 
you always have the lack of funds 
but it seems to be getting worse and worse 
and so they don't settle the resources to draw on to give as much supervision as , as , as ,
and , uh , you know ,
but , uh , 
ery faint yeah . 
but , uh , i , i don't , i don't know 
i think , uh , you know , some of the thing has to do with , uh ,
not that the civil rights program is bad 
but that there's , 
it carried over ,
and it , you know , trickled ou , 
well , tom , just tonight , i was working on my car out of necessity , 
and i had , uh , uh , had a long ageold problem of my bright lights not working , 
uh , this is the type of , uh , switch where you flip the , the lever , the turn signal on the column 
and when i would , uh , put it in the bright light position the lights would go out completely , 
which is even worse than them just not getting bright .
and i had presumed that it was the switch , 
and , uh , this is , uh , an older car , 
it's a seventytwo m g , 
so i had to mail order the part , uh , 
which i had done , 
and tonight i went out and , uh , at least hooked in the new part , only to discover that that apparently is not the problem , 
it's not in the switch , because it does the same thing with the new switch . 
so i'll be faced with having to return that product and , uh , hoping that , uh , you know , that they will accept it , 
although it's been removed from the box it's obviously not been really used . 
uh , i had done what diagnosis i could , primarily by looking at a wiring diagram that i did have of the car 
i talked to one mechanic about it , 
and he suspected the switch also . 
uh , but i've not , you know , 
i really don't know what the problem might be . 
it , it , the other switch could be the main switch itself , uh , that turns the lights on or off , which is on the dashboard 
uh , it might be tied into the equation somehow , 
yeah , i know , 
uh , when working with the , uh , flashers , there is , uh , usually a , a special fuse that operates the flashers . 
do you have a separate fuse for your high beam 
i should look at that . 
i don't remember seeing one in the , uh , in the diagram 
so i'll have to go back and look at that . 
i don't even know if my current cars have a separate fuse . 
i know sometimes when you think there are things running while they're at the same unit , like the headlamp 
but sometimes the extra amperage that a high beam drives as opposed to a low beam requires , uh , the use of a , of a maybe a higher fuse . 
that's a good idea . 
so , that's a possibility . 
what i've typically found when that , uh , 
companies are pretty good about accepting returns on products like that when they're not needed after all , 
and i hope that that's the case this time . 
is this a , a mail order parts house that specializes in , in parts for parts for , uh , old imports ? 
it's out of kansas 
so , it's not j c whitney or somebody like that . 
i also got a piece of chrome for the , the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car , 
but it is not either , 
it's obviously doesn't quite fit , 
so it must be for a different year , 
so i'll have to try to return that as well . 
have you found any , uh , uh , reliable import service people in the metroplex ? 
because i've owned this car since it was new , 
and , uh , 
but it's over like in the brook hollow industrial district down on stemmons and 
oh , yeah . 
and i hadn't used him for some years , 
and the last time i called him back it turned out that he had further specialized 
instead of , uh , all import cars , he has narrowed it down to where he only works on , uh , german cars and {pause german cars .
i'll be darned . 
i'm not sure that he works on much else at all , 
but he doesn't work on british cars any more , and gave me the name of somebody else to take a look at it . 
so , uh , uh , i may have to check with that person , 
as it turns out that one , that shop is near where i now work . 
so , i'll , uh , i should be able to take it in and check that part out . 
i've not had to exchange any other parts recently , because they were defective . 
now , i've had , had pretty good luck , 
i just , however , did , uh , have to get a , a , uh , one of these jam box portable dual cassette players , uh , repaired . 
i purchased it at sam's , 
and i had assumed that it had a ninety day warranty , 
and i should have checked more carefully and done a better job of saving the receipt , 
because i didn't take it in right away , and let a whole year go by . 
uh , some of the buttons didn't work right , where you had to actually physically hold them down to get it to record or to play , 
and as it turned out , it had a full year's warranty , 
and i could have gotten it repaired for free 
oh , my goodness . 
while it was in the shop i ended up finding the receipt that i thought had long since been lost , 
uh , but it didn't do me any good , because i had , i had missed the window by about a week or two . 
oh , no . 
so i didn't even , i didn't really , uh , even bring it up when i went in to pick it up . 
but , uh , that's really my only experience in the past year where i've had to take a product back because of a defect . 
well , ours wasn't within the last year . 
i guess it's been within the last two years , uh , 
judy has an oldsmobile that we bought new , 
and it's one with the , uh , electronic ignition and the computer controlled mixer , and , uh , 
i don't know what else it all controls , but the fuel mixture and cruise control and things of that sort , 
and we found that the , uh , uh , we were having two problems . 
it was idling fast , when you first started the engine , to the point that we park on a hill , under our car port , 
and , it , when you first dropped it into geared it would immediately want to back up into the alley , 
and knowing that , you always had to keep your foot on the brake hard , 
otherwise it would just wrench control away from you . 
good grief . 
and the other problem judy would have is occasionally she would , uh , be driving along , uh , decelerating , like coming to a stop sign , but not yet stopped at the stop sign 
and the engine would just quit . 
so , we took it back to the , uh , oldsmobile place and asked them to check it out , 
and at first they thought it was just a matter of timing , 
so they adjusted timing 
and the problem didn't go away , 
so we ended up taking it back again , 
and i don't know why they don't look at these things the first time around , 
but the second time around they looked at their , uh , recall service and their service reports from region or headquarters whatever , 
and , and they had a description of the exact problem we were experiencing that apparently was a programming error 
which fortunately they replaced under warranty , because it was about a three hundred or three hundred and fifty dollar part 
my goodness . 
and , uh , so once they replaced it , then the , the car seemed to work fine 
and now it seems to be , 
we don , we're not experiencing the stalling , 
but we're still experiencing a very uneven , 
what do you think about it ? 
uh , well , immigration , 
i know they're really strict right now because my hundr , husband is from out of the country 
and , uh , we had to go through a whole , very long process to , uh , to , assure the government that he was , uh , marrying me 
that's interest , 
i think that's , uh , i think it's a little crazy . 
i worked with spanish people 
and just , it was incredible to me to see the things that they had to go through when they were really some of the best workers . 
that's true . 
i mean , you can't just come over to the country because , uh , you want to . 
you know , that's not good enough . 
you have to have a , have to have a darn good reason of , political or whatever . 
not a good , not a good easy way to get in . 
i think , you know , i think in a lot of ways the law is good because it tries to , to protect , you know , the people who are in the states . 
my mother , uh , actually knew a woman in another state that used to marry men 
n , she'd never even meet them 
and she'd just get money for it . 
oh , you're kidding . 
so , uh ,
sounds like a lot of fun . 
it's amazing to me how , how many things they would allow to occur before , you know , you can come in . 
but , i mean , with the new laws , it's 
it's kind of frustrating , too , for those who are legitimate now . 
you know , i think , 
well , and , you know , uh , my grandparents came to this country just wanting a better life , you know 
and they got here , 
but now it's a , you know , it's so strict that you can't just do that . 
and i think it's important that they , you know , they allow a good number of people in every year 
because really they're the ones who work the hardest and do the jobs that , that we don't want to do . 
i agree . 
and i just , 
i don't know , 
i have , personally i have a problem with it , 
i think , that , you know , if someone wants to come in and they can prove that they're going to work and they're going to be a good citizen that 
if they're not going to be on welfare or , or , or whatever . 
they're going to be a productive citizen zen . 
and , you know , i , i believe that if someone goes on welfare that's when , you , you know , send them back to their country . 
and , i think a lot of times we're so busy trying to keep them out that we're spending twice as much money as we would just allowing them in 
well , think of how many illegal aliens have , have , have been , uh , uh , sent back to mexico just to find their way back . 
and that's , that's what i think . 
you know , i , i have to laugh 
because , like i said , i worked with a lot of those 
and they'd been deported two or three times 
and just basically what they do is they get caught when they wanted to go home for christmas .
that's right , 
that's our money . 
that's true . 
but , i think , you know , i think all in all there's a lot of improvements . 
i think the general idea is good 
but , but there could be some work done in the area . 
i , i think 
i , i agree . 
well good .
anyway , do you have anything else in the , the subject , uh 
uh , i , uh , 
this is spur of the moment , uh , 
but , i , i don't really see any , any changes that i think of really blatant right now 
other than i think they ought to take , you know , on a case by case basis and not necessarily make it a , uh , political refugee . 
i think a lot of times we take , you know , basically who we want to 
because if you , if you have connections , it's a lot easier to get in . 
connections and money . 
and i think , you know , it should be more of a thing that's based upon someone's intent , you know .
and then not like the united states , 
basically , it's not who you know , 
it d , it doesn't become a thing of who you know , but , but how the type of person you are . 
i agree . 
and it should be based on those kinds of things so the good people , like probably your husband , can get in .
well , we got him past that , 
but , uh , 
well , great . 
i know there's a lot of other people out there ,
well , let's see , 
is there anything i believe in .
i think that's it . 
is this like a very short call ? .
i'm not sure how long they're supposed to be , 
but , i've enjoyed it . 
it's good hearing your , your point of view 
and i think that's neat . 
i think we agree a lot on that 
i did , too . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
well , thanks , 
i'm glad you're home . 
you have a good evening , all right ? 
you , too . 
well , seems to me the , one of the reasons that people don't go out to vote is maybe they're bored with the whole election process . 
well , i agree with the boredom of the election process , 
but i also , uh , think that people don't realize that their boat , vote will make a difference . 
uh , they feel like that , you know , it's going to go however it's going to go 
and their one little vote is not going to make that much difference 
well , sometimes , strangely enough , one vote has made the difference . 
well , i agree with that 
and i , and i do know that , you know , all those votes are counted 
and , and they do make a difference . 
uh , also i think that people have a tendency to , to vote in the larger elections and not vote in the , the more local elections . 
well , it's kind of strange 
because in the local elections is the ones that have the most influence on their daytoday lives . 
and , i , i even have a tendency to do that myself . 
and i have to really make a concerted effort to , to get involved . 
i live , i live in a suburb in mesquite 
and , uh , so i really have to make an effort to read the local paper and to see what's going to because that directly affects me . 
but i , i think on the whole , most people don't , uh , feel that way . 
or don't look , even look at that . 
i think they just don't even , 
i , i don't think they're conscious of it . 
well , maybe part of the problem is they don't , they think they have enough choices . 
well , that may be true , too . 
i hadn't thought of that . 
you know , in some of the european countries , they have numbers of parties that run 
and then lot of more voters come out to vote than vote in this country . 
and sometimes it's , uh , 
well , not sometimes , but many times it's who has the most money to spend on the largest campaign 
and , and issues get , uh , bogged down . 
well , maybe it's a matter of , you know , voter awareness . 
uh , i think voter awareness , 
i , i did some work for the , uh , women's league of , uh , voters , uh , several years ago 
and , i think there are some organizations that used to , uh , do some voter awareness , uh , things . 
they don't get a lot of participation . 
they don't get a lot of , uh , activity . 
most of the league of women voters , what they did was they put out information , so that it , it would just be made available to everyone . 
now , other areas that i've worked in , like in the chambers , they would just have the candidates come 
and it would just , you know , 
that was not a lot of community involvement 
and those were people that would mostly vote anyway . 
well , i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long . 
in britain , you know , they have a set period of time 
and , and for campaign , that's it . 
in this country , it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign . 
and it's expensive campaign 
and it , it , uh , eliminates a lot of qualified people . 
uh , maybe more qualified and , uh , more dedicated to the issues . 
well , the , they don't want to spend the time 
or they don't have the money . 
and it , it , 
i , i can't b , i just can't believe , 
i've , i've worked in a couple of local campaigns . 
i just cannot believe the dollars that are spent just even locally . 
well , it's a matter of name recognition . 
people aren't going to vote for someone they've never heard of . 
oh , well , i agree with that , 
but also , 
and i , and i'm not for controlling how much is spent , 
but do you know , 
that's one thing , 
if a , if the time wasn't so , 
if it wasn't such a long , uh , campaigning time , then they couldn't spend as much money . 
and even debates don't seem to help much . 
they really don't . 
uh , it's al , it's , a lot of it is who looks the best , who , uh , who happens to say the right thing at the right time , who , not , who may not be the most qualified and can get the b , uh , the job done . 
so we're really voting for the best makeup person and the best handlers . 
and it's a , it's a lot , 
i've worked in public relations a lot 
and , uh , that kind of thing can make and break , make or break you 
well , that was certainly a media event . 
and it's just , uh , uh , 
he possibly could have , uh , won that election had it not been for some of the  , the , uh , the way he presented himself . 
well , he had a classic case of hoof in mouth disease . 
hoof , is , is , i guess the right term for him . 
thank you . 
i understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight . 
i hope you know more about it than i do . 
oh , well  , i just got through reading , uh , space by , uh , james michener . 
oh , is that right ? 
and so that , uh , helped out a little bit i think . 
i haven't read his book . 
i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible . 
well , he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes . 
and i don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas 
so i wasn't sure how credible he was . 
oh , is that right ? 
but anyway , what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights ? 
well i'm not sure to be honest with you , 
so , uh , this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure 
ego trip . 
it was nice to go there , 
but i don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much . 
i happen to live not too far away from , 
uh , well , i've actually worked for the company that , uh , has been blamed for the challenger disaster . uh 
oh , is that right ? 
and , uh , you know , that's been kind of a real negative feeling here 
 sure it was , you know , very unfortunate thing that occurred there 
and it's , 
where do you live ? 
uh , we live in , uh , utah . 
am i talking to utah right now ? 
oh , oh , great . 
i have a sister that lives in dallas , 
that's how we got hooked up to the program was her 
i see . 
carolyn rash ? 
pardon me ? 
is her name rash , carolyn rash ? 
i see . 
and [his last name is weight . 
and , uh , 
well , you probably know a lot about it . 
i wasn't sure that they were blaming that space disaster on one company . 
i hadn't heard that . 
well , they were . 
there was , uh , 
apparently the specifications for the joints , uh , 
they were not to perform in , uh , cold weather 
and , uh , apparently there was definitely a joint that did not seal , 
and , uh , if you've ever seen the size of those , uh , motors 
i mean , they're as long as a football field practically and 
lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air . 
oh , yeah . 
so this book was interesting , though . 
i , uh , 
talked about how a lot of the problems they have to overcome to , uh , 
it's a very complex , uh , situation to go into space . 
oh , yeah , 
i would think so , too .
they would , 
the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how much of a problem it is to reenter the earth's atmosphere . 
i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be 
but they have to come in at just the right angle . 
if you come in at the wrong angle , what happens is they bounce off and go back into space 
 and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up . 
well , i saw some of those early space capsules at smithsonian . 
i'm sure you've 
they had though piles 
 but you could see how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting . 
well , i , 
excuse me , go ahead . 
oh , yeah . 
i've seen that they 
well , these were the ones that john glenn went up in 
the very first ones , 
the little bell type things . 
people have commented how , uh , they were surprised at how small they were . 
they really were , 
looked pretty 
oh , yeah , 
and , yeah , i mean , you actually put it on  , you know . 
is that right ? 
it was so small . 
well , i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space , 
but did he go into that in the book ? 
i guess that's just to sell us on it . 
one thing's , 
i know one thing they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book , by the way , 
but , it talked about , uh , 
they're able to manufacture , uh , different kinds of crystals 
oh , yeah . 
it's perfectly round . 
but i'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity . 
well , that's true 
that's right .
well , do you think we should continue to support it at the level , 
well , i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying . 
and uh 
uh , i think they have cut it back , to be honest with you .
uh , i appreciate having the satellites . 
you know , that's certainly made it nice for other purpose . 
i don't know if you have a satellite dish or not . 
we don't 
uh , go ahead . 
aids research is something that ,
more money   , 
and actually i'm concerned that they're not . 
i have a friend who is working with , uh , who works with , uh , travel groups , 
and one of the ones that he's w , worked with was professionals who came in for an aids , uh , conference in , uh , california . 
and these were from other , people from other countries . 
he's a translator . 
and in talking to the people from france he said , you know , 
and they're letting ,
which is scary , you know , pretty scary when so many people get it . 
so , i guess i'm , i'm , i'd like to see us spend more . 
i don't know that spending more always gets it . 
i'm , i'm ambivalent about it because , um , uh , i , well it is very frightening and scary . 
i have no perspective on how it relates to other diseases , 
and , uh , i mean whether , 
you mean more money for that means less for cancer or , 
y , yeah . 
and , uh , whether those diseases can yo , 
some difference could be made if you did pour more money in like diabetes research 
didn't , uh , you know , 
but i , uh , 
then t , part of it's lack of education . 
i don't know whether , whether , you know , where our money would be most effectively spent . 
well it , 
i , i agree with you there 
because i know every time that i , something comes into vogue all the money goes to that one 
and you don't know whether it's still also going to the other or if it's a limited pie . 
money from , money for taking care of the infants takes money away from taking care of the elderly , 
or do they both get served ? 
uh , that's a good point . 
and i'm , i am concerned a lot about , uh , i'm concerned about , uh , two things . 
one is preventing the spread 
and the other is for , uh , for , uh , treating the illness . 
and i'm not certain , 
i , i , 
again this , 
basically i don't have any opinion . 
but whether or not it would be , uh , our money would be better spent , uh , teaching , you know , working on the drug problems and the , and the sex problems , uh , rather than trying to cure the people that already have it . 
well , and one of the things i'd , 
and i'm with you that i don't know is , is that really the only way it's being transmitted or was that the easier way to tell us and we're going to find out more . 
well , you know , 
that's , that's the part that , 
t , d , whether my dentist or  , 
that's the part that scares me , you know . 
well no , 
it's for homosexuals and gays , 
well no , 
actually , it's , 
i mean , you know . 
did they know that all along ? 
an , and i heard something the other day , this sounds ridiculous , about mosquitoes . 
can't get it from mosquitoes . 
and i don't know that's true or not . 
i mean , i just heard it in passing , 
but so what does that , 
what does that mean for people that you work with and shake hands with and  , 
and how is it really transmitted ,
which is , i think , what they also don't know . 
i mean that's , 
i think they , they told us what was convenient and felt safe to say , you know . 
it was nice to isolate it to one particular community that they have trouble , you know , they just as soon not approve of anyway , 
but , but that isn't how it was in africa . 
in africa was the men and women and , and had nothing to do with that , 
and it's huge over there . 
so i , i , you know , 
and it's beginning , t , other countries 
that's what's his point . 
and does that mean like flus and everything else , there are all these different strains of it ? 
i mean i don't know . 
all i'm saying is i think it's scarier than we know . 
uh , or maybe they understand but , 
i think maybe more information should be given out about it . 
and , uh , and then the people that have it , 
it does seem that there are , are some drugs that are there that , you know , they keep holding back . 
if you , if i were dying , i'm not sure i would care . 
i , i , give me cyanide . 
i mean , is it   , 
i'll take anything 
i mean if i'm dying , if i know i'm dying ,
go ahead . 
and why can't you , why can't the f d a say , you know , i , if these people knowingly consent to be ,
let them ,
and that's what i think they're saying too . 
have you s , had any snow up your way ? 
and , uh 
the ski resorts were really 
and , uh , 
but , now we have , we've had fog , for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion , 
the snows all melted off mount , uh , 
well , i talked to a woman who lived up in the hills , uh ,
and she had , uh , quite a bit of snow on the ground her way . 
i guess there's different parts of the state of utah that , that , does have some , 
but not , 
usually we have up to a hundred and fifty inches up at the ski resorts 
and they're down between thirtyeight and , uh , forty inches . 
at this time of the year , 
and we've been in a drought for the last five years 
and this is the sixth year 
and it's getting quite serious , as far as water next summer . 
well , the weather , uh , here , is always a topic of conversation in texas . 
but , uh , we have wide variations and have warm weather when most people have cold weather , 
but we have our share of cold weather as well . 
the , uh , temperature this morning was right at freezing . 
it didn't stay there , 
but it was right at , 
we usually have some of our coldest weather toward the , uh , end of january , 
but this year it wasn't bad at all . 
i guess that's because we had so much rain . 
i know my son was telling me about the rain down there . 
he said it was just , 
and we read in the newspaper , southern part of texas i guess 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , 
well , my , uh , my sister lives in houston 
and they , uh ,
and that , uh , caused some , uh , concern , of course . 
oh , boy . 
they have a , uh , lake cabin 
and , uh , their dock was completely under water 
oh , my gosh . 
so we really had a lot of rain . 
yeah my son in plano , he lives fairly close to , 
there's quite a wash that goes down , uh , through plano 
and , uh , there's walking trails on both sides , a walking path , 
and , uh , when i've gone down to visit him i've gone on that , 
but , uh , that was clear full and up to , up to some of the streets , i guess . 
it just k , 
we had a lot of flash floods in the area . 
we had a few people who ran into , uh , water and a few fatalities , uh , just a few . 
not more than ten 
that's funny that , uh , we can't have it in moderation instead of having either a drought or having too much . 
well , the , uh ,
it's always too damn cold , too damn hot , too damn windy .
well , it's , uh , interesting , 
i'm going down to el paso next week 
and , uh , i was wondering what the weather was , 
but i imagine if it's that cold in dallas it , 
well , el paso won't be cold . 
and it's , it's rare to get real cold in , in el paso . 
the , uh , you'll be flying in there ? 
well , uh , take off is , uh , fun from el paso because you normally , 
the way the winds are you take off right toward the mountain , the rockies 
and they're towering above you 
and so you circle back over the air and then make a circle around and come back over again . 
we're kind of used to that here in utah , 
course , there are mountains , 
and i fly into montana a lot 
and we have a , 
the mountains are , are really , uh , high 
and a lot of places we go in to , you just kind of , uh , 
it's in the little valley , 
but , i , uh , sure hope we , 
we really need the moisture . 
i hope we can get , uh , get some . 
there's supposed to be a storm , 
but it split , went down through , uh , northern arizona and southern utah 
and they're not predicting any for the next , uh , week anyway up here 
well , i noticed on the weather map on , uh , cable network that there was supposed to be a storm front moving into california and on down your way , 
well , that's , that's what the , 
  above , uh , 
some of it went to the south and some to the north up into montana , 
so that just left us , 
we got a high pressure 
and , uh , we broke the record for the amount of fog that we've had , uh , you know 
oh , boy . 
airport's been shut down , uh , till about noon every day 
and then they seed the clouds , or seed the fog to try to 
we went up to visit my wife's , uh , sister who lives in , uh , calgary , alberta , can , 
well , the topic's about government . 
uh , i'm not altogether sure that that's my best topic . uh , 
i thought it was kind of a strange topic about corruption in the government and 
i mean , [
i mean that's what i would like to think . 
or how much unethical behavior can be made illegal 
maybe that's what is happening . 
maybe so many things have become public with the media over the past , you know , ten to twenty years 
perhaps things that we didn't think of before and just concentrated on the lawmaking or the results that would be seen in public works or bills that are passed or , you know , et cetera like that 
 and we were just not exposed to the personal lives of these persons . 
and i couldn't help thinking it was a funny question 
that makes sense . 
because you start prying in people's private lives , you ruin their lives as well as , 
that's right . 
and sometimes , you know , i don't even know how much of a difference it really makes , you know . 
i mean , i guess in some cases , sure we care about what they did in the past 
 but , uh , sometimes , i don't know 
i think it gets in the way of the better judgment . 
i mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician . 
uh , and also that if the results that they're putting out and what they actually seem to be accomplishing by 
that's it . 
and , uh 
[that's the thing that , 
uh , things that you don't know 
so , i guess , you know , 
but , as soon as things do get public 
so , sometimes i ask myself , what are , uh , people doing that are in the media 
it seems that one of the first thing that's done is to dig up any kind of a thing they can on them 
oh , yeah 
i guess it's what sells newspapers , you know . 
it's a very low way of living . 
uh , so , 
[[i'm not terribly involved in it . 
just in a very cursory way . 
i vote 
and i , you know , try to do whatever i can on the little local area , 
but , [[a lot of my particular time and effort 
so , i always feel very outside 
but , uh , 
i am kind of the same way . 
i just kind of read the paper 
 but i don't really play an active role 
uh , uhhuh . 
i'm not in there , 
i'm not one of those , uh , you know , volunteers that's down at headquarters and whatever , uh , although i admire the people that do that 
and they certainly do get inside information 
 and , uh , of course , the better you know a person that might be affiliated with that kind 
but the media insight , as you said , 
i just kind of read and kind of be aware 
 and then , uh , i don't like to make a whole lot of , uh , judgment myself 
all right . 
that's a real different topic . 
i'm not sure i'm familiar with , with what they mean of invasion of privacy . 
i know . 
i guess that , i guess you consider just things that every day that would , you would think of about . 
see , i'm a college student , 
so i can think of lots of things that my roommate does that bother me 
but i think 
i think , personally , you know , 
i'm , i used to be a college student 
but uh , now i think an invasion of my privacy is when someone calls me on the telephone 
oh , golly . 
where did you get my phone number , 
and why do you think it's a deal for me ? 
i mean , those people , they'll call you any time of the day or night with , try to solicit 
and that's an invasion of my privacy , i think . 
they call late , 
now , i mean , now there's , i heard that they were going to start calling on saturdays or some , 
oh , they do already . 
see , that's ridi , 
i would be so mad .
and i've even had the computer generated calls on sundays , too . 
but i do know of a way to get around the computer generated calls . 
don't answer your phone , hello . 
the computer's geared to , to start talking to you on the , on the word hello . 
i don't know , 
i think like things that , that 
i think's like privacy is like , just like , not going through my stuff , like going through , just like my clothes or my drawer , just going through my stuff , basically . 
oh , yeah . 
that drives me up a wall . 
are you and your roommate a similar size . 
and , uh . 
and she still goes through your clothes ? 
she'll take all my shirts and stuff , 
because she can't wear like my pants 
but she'll take all my shirts and my blouses and stuff . 
man , i'm just glad she can't wear my pants or my skirts or my dresses , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
but still , she'll just take them , 
and she won't even think about it , 
and then , i'll like see her that day , 
and she'll be wearing my clothes , 
i really don't . 
because she doesn't even ask me . 
stuff like that really  , 
like that's an invasion of my privacy , i feel like . 
oh , yeah , 
i agree . 
stuff like that , 
when you have your door closed , people just walking in and stuff like that . 
i was thinking like my mom . 
i know this , 
she would think this is like an invasion of her privacy , is like going through her purse , like if you ever needed money and stuff 
oh , yeah . 
we always just give her her purse , you know , 
and she'll 
i was trying to think , 
i was thinking that's the only thing i could really think of that would really be . 
my mom doesn't even like for us to go through her cabinets . 
i mean , we're all grown , 
all her kids are grown , 
and we have our own families 
don't you have your own house to dig through ? 
 that's great . 
so , i guess , privacy is really , 
and at the work place , i suppose , 
oh , well , actually yes . 
i can say definitely ,
i hate it for people to open up my drawer 
because that was , that was where i kept all my stuff , 
and i could tell i mean , even if a pen was turned the wrong way . 
you could tell , 
you know you put your stuff where it's , 
that would drive , that would , that  , 
it would drive , it drove me batty for a while . 
well , i worked a second shift 
and everybody else in my area worked first shift 
and our shifts overlapped 
so i would come in , 
and there would be people sitting at my desk , working , 
it's my vitamins , 
i wonder , what is , you know , yeah , what is , 
why are they working at my desk , 
and can i have it back . 
can i have it back soon , maybe . 
then you start missing stuff , 
oh , yeah , 
no mommy is going to take the vitamins , 
i'm sorry , 
i have   .
that's okay . 
see that would , that would make me really mad , 
because you can always tell when someone's touched your stuff , 
just because , 
i mean , i know i have everything like a certain way 
and you know how it looks and everything . 
oh , yeah . 
well , you know how you left it the day before . 
uhhuh . [child_talking 
that would bother me , definitely . 
oh , yeah , 
so , that's , 
i agree , 
it's , it's pretty tough that way , 
and , i know , even like with your school books and papers . 
do you miss your papers sometimes ? 
you know . 
that's the only thing i can really think about being an invasion of privacy , like something every day , though . 
well , actually i do know , 
and i have used it once 
and it , it really is an invasion of privacy , 
but in the library there's a book that you can find out what people's phone numbers are by where they live , their street address . 
oh , really ? 
and that , 
i mean , i've , i've used it once , 
all right , 
well d , d , do you play any musical instruments or , 
i used to . 
oh well , 
i think everybody took piano lessons 
i , i started when i was in , uh , third grade , 
and i've , i still play the piano as of today . 
do you ? 
i started , 
i think i was in the fifth grade 
and i played it for maybe three months .
but , then , again , i was also in , uh , the marching band . 
i played the drums , 
i played the clarinet , 
i played the trumpet . 
uh , you know , whatever 
and so i ,
and i sing in the choir today 
all right .
i en , i enjoy the music , 
it gives me an out . 
it always sounds like , 
for my playing the piano when i was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with i could always go play with the piano , you know . 
so , how long did you play ? 
only for about three months . 
three months . 
me and my brother both took the classes 
and we got pretty bored quick .
i was going to say , y , y , you got as far as the , uh , chop sticks , huh . 
um , well , i could play , uh , the wood chuck song . 
oh , the wood chuck song .
and i still can to this date . 
they went out and bought us a piano 
and for three months .
oh , bless your heart . 
oh , yeah , 
oh , okay , 
but i mean , can you play anything on it , other than wood chuck song ? 
no . 
and jaws , 
but i think everybody can . 
i c , i , i can still read music if i'm lucky 
because i , 
if i work real hard i can still barely read the music , 
but , see , i played the piano 
i played chic , uh , concertos and other stuff 
i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music , i was memorizing music , 
so because of that , i can't read music as well as i used to , 
but i enjoy it , though . 
i find it to be a good out 
and i still enjoy the marching band 
and i still enjoy , uh , singing in the choir 
do you sing at choir at your church ? 
i do . 
in fact , that's about the only musical thing that i still do 
i tried out for choir when i was , think , in the seventh grade 
and they wouldn't let me in . 
i do know if they want me to or not , 
but at least i do sing in it .
that's pretty good . 
i never really learned the music or anything . 
i never learned , 
i got right to where i was figuring out where all the keys were on the piano 
and that's about when i quit . 
i was at , 
i actually went to the university of texas at one time thinking that i would , c , be a musician . 
i wanted to be a high school band director . 
this isn't for me . 
enjoy it , but not for profession , no . 
and besides that i kind of learned i wasn't really that good .
i gave up . 
course , my mom thought i was , 
but , uh , you know , 
of course , 
parents always do . 
oh , yeah , 
they're nice that way . 
well , what else can we d , uh , talk about , 
uh , well , i don't , d , 
so you listen to kind of church music , gospel ? 
oh , yeah ? 
yeah . 
so i listen to the radio , 
i like the pop music . 
oh , yeah . 
i like people like neil diamond and all , all the folks that you're not supposed to like , 
but that's who i go for .
oh , yeah , 
the jeezer music as i call it . 
oh , the jeezer music . 
oh , okay , 
my boss listens to that . 
we listen to ninetyseven point nine 
and that's his station , so i call it the jeezer music . 
now what d , kind of music do you listen to ? 
well , i listen to like ninetyseven point one , you know , more , 
what d , what is that ? 
it's more , uh , 
i don't know how to explain it , 
kind of pop , you know , rock . 
rock . 
hard rock ? 
well , not hard .
not hard rock . 
just kind of , 
not like the eagle . 
is that the eagle ? 
i know , i know what the eagle is . 
it's not too hard , 
that's not too hard . 
you know . 
but it's not enough to put you to sleep .
which some of the songs on k v i l can . 
well , course , see , i listen to k v i l for the contests . 
i mean  , 
oh , yeah , 
got the bumper sticker , too ? 
oh , yes , 
you can't drive a car without bumper sticker 
and you know they're going to call you up . 
well , listen , i've enjoyed talking . 
i , i'm sure that the switchboard will probably give us that sign off message very shortly anyway . 
i appreciate it . 
catch you later . 
okay .
have you done this very long ? 
uh , well , yeah , 
that's the same with us . 
well , what kind of car would you buy ? 
well , it's kind of hard to say , 
uh , because i don't think we're going to buy another car for about three years . 
we just 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , 
wait a minute , 
we bought one in ninety . 
we've got three cars , of all things . 
so , uh , probably we'll be in at least a midsize , four door sedan . 
what kind do you have now ? 
uh , we have a , a mazda nine twenty nine and a ford crown victoria and a little two seater c r x . 
oh , okay . 
uh , it's rather difficult to , to project what kind of , uh , 
we'd , look , always look into , uh , consumer reports to see what kind of , uh , report , or , uh , repair records that the various cars have 
and then , of course , we look into the prices . 
and , uh , f , uh , we're not adverse to buying along in the summer when , when the cars could get to be discounted 
because we keep , we've begun to keep them , uh , long , a longer period of time . 
uh , i traded off an eightytwo oldsmobile for the eightynine mazda . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , uh , 
and did you find that you like the foreign cars better than the domestic ? 
uh , yeah , 
we , we've had thirty some odd cars in our married life , 
and , uh , we , we've had a good many foreign cars . 
and , uh , they , they , uh , 
i've been extremely , 
we've had three mazdas . 
we've been extremely pleased with our mazdas . 
oh , really ? 
we've always bought american made cars , mostly oldsmobiles . 
well , we , we've had , uh , 
let's see , 
we had , uh , we had a , uh , 
let me think . 
{pause we had a fiftythree 
and a , uh , we had , uh , two fiftythrees which is a long thirty minute story .
uh , and we had a sixtyfive 
and then we had this eightytwo . 
so we , we really can't complain about oldsmobiles , really . 
we've been real pleased with ours . 
i think we've had , one , two , three 
and most , 
we have a cutlass , we still have a cutlass supreme which is like , a seventyseven . 
then we have a cutlass sierra 
and we've had the ninetyeight . 
but i don't know , 
we'll , we're going to be in the market for a car , probably in the next year 
and  , the financing is always something we consider , you know , the four percent or when they 
but , i don't know what we're going to buy . 
i always thought i would like to try a foreign made car , 
but , boy , with all the auto workers being laid off , makes me feel guilty .
uh , my son over in shreveport , uh , sold porsches , audis , mad , mazdas and volkswagons for ten years 
and that was one of the deciding factors in getting the mazdas . 
uh , so , uh , the first foreign car that we had was a , a seventyseven m g , m g b 
oh the , 
was british gr , racing green , with real wire wheels and a hard top and a soft top . 
ooh , boy . 
and , uh , i drove it mostly . 
i'll bet 
it really was . 
my husband was in the air force 
and we got transferred to okinawa . 
so , uh , we had to sell it . 
w , which really tore me up .
oh , yeah . 
because , uh , it , it w , it was great fun . 
and then , uh , when we got to okinawa , well , we bought a second hand , 
we , uh , we decided that , uh , 
we had this , uh , sixtyfive oldsmobile 
and it , and it was just too big , 
so we , we sold it to a fellow who was coming back to the states 
and we got a little fiat , uh , and a , and the little , uh , forty horse power mazda , four door sedan . 
so what do you think about caring for older folks dale ? 
well , i think , uh the elderly is a really neat population to care for . 
they've got a lot of special needs 
and at the same time , uh , the majority of them don't want to give up the independence that they have . 
very definitely . 
and so you've got a real balance to make there . 
what about you ? 
well , i'm thinking about it more in terms of my parents that are starting to get old . 
they aren't really that old , 
but they are , sort of wearing out . 
my mamma is a dialysis patient 
and she is only about sixtyfour , 
but she's had some pretty close calls 
and my daddy has to drive her to dialysis now 
and so she's phasing out {sounds like 
and , but she's also a very , very , very independent person and doesn't like having having people , uh , not being able to do things for herself when she wants to 
uh , i know they certainly don't want to be in a nursing home , 
but my daddy keeps talking about it . 
i don't , 
i couldn't possibly ,
{very faint . 
and my grand daddy also doesn't like , wouldn't want to be in a nursing home . 
he's ninety , i think right on ninety right now 
oh really . 
and he's living by himself . 
my grand mamma died a couple of years ago 
oh , okay . 
so but , he's , you know , 
as long as you can have the families take care of the people , i'd like to see them stay at home . 
but it gets hard . 
my , my grandmother is in her mid eighties 
and she's , uh , suffering from , uh , well , uh , progressive alzheimer's disease 
so she doesn't remember anybody 
and , uh , she remembers things , 
but they are things back whenever she was real young 
and so , with , 
she was living by herself 
but my , uh , uncle has moved in with her to take care of her 
and it's creating a lot of problems . 
especially for your uncle i bet . 
oh yes . 
now a friend of mine who was studying social work here in philadelphia worked for an adult day care program for mostly for patient's with alzheimer . 
do they have anything like that in dallas . 
in dallas , 
uh , yeah . 
i've , i've heard of several things 
and they are really neat programs to be able to do if you can link up with them , 
but sometimes it's hard to either find the connections to get them in or , uh , to be able to get them there for the day program and pick them up . 
so they are pretty limited . 
oh , another interesting thing , 
another good friend of mine who got her degree in social gerontology wa , well had a job for a while where she went around to to folks and had them , sort of kicked them in the pants to make them take good care of their older relatives .
oh really . 
i don't think that was mainly with alzheimer's patients , but just patients , people in general who were not as independent as they use to be . 
well , it , it's , it's a really , day care programs are really neat , you know 
and if the , if the people are able and and can get up and move and everything like that , that is one of the best things to do , 
but i think the hardest thing to do is whenever you've got a person who's mentally very alert and active 
uhhuh {very faint . 
and i think that's in a way it's more , some , an area where some of the day care , uh , 
because you really kind of have to be a little bit mobile to be able to do those . 
to , uh , get there and to participate in the activities . 
cause i know , there's one not too far from from me here in dallas . 
uh , and they have ceramics and pottery and needle work 
but if your vision is gone and you have arthritis real badly , 
that's true . 
you can't play those things . 
you can't do it . 
but you can sing songs and , uh 
well , that's true . 
i guess , you know , you were talking about your , 
was it your grand mother 
you can perhaps get a group of people that aren't too far along with alzheimer talking about the old times and enjoying it themselves that way . 
and they love to recollect . 
i mean they just , you know , 
and they will just go on and on with these stories 
and they have such a memory . 
do they like to listen to other people recollect though ? 
she , she wants to te , to tell you about her story over again 
which is fine , you know , 
well , that is good because we , 
um , so what do you think ? 
i lived , i lived in sweden for two years . 
and in sweden they have socialized medicine . 
and so i saw some of the good 
and also i saw some of the bad that results from such a program . 
uh , some of the , some of the good obviously that nobody has to worry about health care . 
so it's a very , it's a very , uh , comfortable , 
i mean our people are very comfortable in the sense that , you know , there's no medical emergency that's going to make you destitute for life . 
um , the bad was more apparent i think at least for me 
because i think it affected people's lives on , in a way that you could see . 
one , one thing that i noticed is it's very , very convenient to be alcoholic in sweden . 
oh , really ? 
because it's treated as a disease . 
now i don't know if that necessarily has to be part of socialized medicine , 
but , uh , if you're , if you're alcoholic , then you're treated as if you're on disability , longterm disability 
and so there was very little incentive for people to get out of that . 
also , um , another thing that , that i noticed that was very strange , 
i was , uh , i would go down all these , uh , uh , 
i remember this one row of houses 
and they were , uh , row houses or townhouses ,
well , it would be lower middleclass housing here . 
it's probably middleclass housing there . 
um , and there was a taxi driver that lived in one of these 
and there was a doctor that lived in one of these . 
the one guy was a doctor 
and one was a taxi driver , 
and so their , their incomes were about the same . 
whereas here , there is a great incentive to be a doctor because there's a great financial reward . 
and that , that didn't exist in sweden . 
and , uh , overall i gue , their , their health care suffered fair amount from just the fact that the doctor salaries were lower 
and it was , it was less professional 
and it was treated more ,
that is , uh , that is something i've heard . 
uh , i had a friend , uh , that i worked with that was from sweden 
and that was , uh , 
probably the , the major concern i have is that , you know , we are leading in the technology realm of , of medicine just because it is such a great incentive to , to get into , uh , the medical field , 
but at the same time it's real hard . 
i mean my husband works for a company that provides insurance 
and so , you know , i'm real , you know , 
it's like well , you know , you know , 
there's got to be better ways , you know , to do some things 
but , you know , i hate to , uh , 
the , the competition , i , in a lot of ways is , is wonderful just because you can choose your doctor 
and , and , uh , they have to compete to be , to be good and to be knowledgeable . 
but at the same time , there's a , you know , they're regulating themselves 
and , and the hospitals are charging just enormous amounts for products that they don't have to pay very much for . 
my , i have a brother who's a vet 
and for something that he can get , you know , wholesale 
and i'm sure they can get a lot cheaper because they , they , hospitals buy in such a bulk rate , um 
you know , they could charge you twenty dollars for a dollar fifty item 
and that's ridiculous . 
and i don't think that is , that is , uh , abnormal in any means to be doing things like that . 
you don't think it's abnormal ? 
i don't think it's abnormal for hospitals to be doing that at all .
oh , i see . 
you're not saying it's right , 
you're just saying it's common . 
and so i , i , it's , i think , i , to me i think , uh , something that's going to help our medical , uh , arena is for , um , 
and i don't know how to , i don't know how to do this 
but i think people are too lawsuit happy . 
and i mean things will happen 
and , and you've got to , uh , keep up 
or you've got to realize that , you know , i , it is just men or women that are , that are making , um , decisions 
and they will make mistakes 
and e , e , you know , i , if people , you know , i , 
there are some people that i'm sure make mistakes because they just don't keep on top of it , 
and , um , i don't know . 
i , i think the fact that malpractice has gone up i think has raised our prices just dramatically . um ,
and i think that's something that if , if they could work on the cause of that and , 
well it's , uh , 
uh , i don't know . 
i get , probably , most of my information either from the newspaper or from c n n . 
uh , i like c n n because it , uh , you know , repeats it , 
well headline news repeats every half hour 
but it 
and , uh , 
but the newspaper p , provides a little bit of depth 
i , i think i'd agree . 
a , a s , similar method of getting the news with me too . 
it's , uh , uh , c n n has been a welcome addition to   the t v scene here in the ,
uh , p , prior to cable , you know , you didn't get much news off of normal , uh , television broadcasts . 
uh , just usually pretty local in , in nature 
and , and i like , uh , c n n because you get some world , world events too 
i know , the , 
my only major objection is that , uh , i don't think american media spends enough , uh , attention on , on our closest neighbors like mexico and canada . 
that , that's true , you know . 
you hardly ever see , uh , headline articles about the , uh , either the economics or , or other wor , news events going on in either of those countries . 
uh , whereas if you pick up a , a european paper , you know , uh , it , all the surrounding countries , soviet union , and everything has , uh , major news , uh , articles in them . 
i mean , you know , canada has gone through a lot of problems now with , with quebec and , and everything 
and , uh , it's amazing that , 
you know , i , i listen to d c area and the washington post , you know , 
i mean the most they'll give it is the back of the a section . 
uh , you know . 
i'm , i'm currently living in dallas 
and it , it won't even give it the back section .
you just ,
uh , which is a shame because you go to other countries , uh , 
and , and they carry quite a bit about the u s on the other hand . 
and if you go up to , uh , canada , those people are usually pretty , uh , familiar with the politics going on and and the 
and we're pretty , uh , limited in our understanding of , of leaders up in canada or mexico . 
you just don't know what's going on . 
i'd , i , 
every once in awhile , i have to travel overseas 
and lately i've taken the , taken a little shortwave radio , uh , around and picking up the b b c 
and it's sort of like , uh , a c n n too . 
and you get some , like thirty minute summaries of , of news events . 
uh , i occasionally get into some of the middle eastern , uh , area 
and that's the only way you can tell .
there's not much in the way of television in some 
uh , but that's a good point about , about the neighboring countries . 
i hadn't really thought about it 
but i guess you don't think about it cause you don't hear it . 
i , uh , spent this past summer up in canada . 
uh , well part of it , touring . 
and , uh , you know , i , i was amazed cause i'd pick up a local paper and i'd read about all of these , you know , really interesting things going on . 
there's some serious talk about whether there's actually going to be a , a canada , you know , in the next five years .
and n , i had never heard any of that before . 
you know , there was , a , a , 
what is it called , 
is it meech lake accord ? 
or , or , i , that's just something , uh , i'd say ninety percent of the people here would never have heard of 
and i think that i heard of it about the first time when i was up in calgary a couple of years ago and , you know , picked up a , a paper and started reading a little bit more detail about it . 
and , and c , came   , 
it was a big thing going on there 
and i came back here 
and nothing in the papers . 
i didn't see a thing about it . 
so it's , uh , we've got a long ways to go , i guess . 
it's improved . 
and like i say , with c n n and , and , uh , the cable news . 
even , even there's , uh , uh , 
it's sor , it's semireligious in some respects . 
but what is it ? 
it's , uh , i mean it's news is not , not that way , 
uh , oh , i'm trying to think of the channel . 
the , the christian science monitor . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , i , it surprised me . 
i've caught it a few times 
and they , they do some pretty good news . 
uh , seemingly unbiased news broadcasts . 
you'd think it would carry mostly religious 
but it , it doesn't seem to . 
so i'll flip through and listen to it once in awhile too , uh , and catch something maybe a little different than , than c n n might be covering . 
uh , some more in , interest type topics in , in other countries . 
but it's kind of world , world , uh , network too . 
uh , i , i guess i've never seen the t v show . 
i used to get the , uh , 
a , uh , golden retriever . 
ooh , that's 
is it really ? 
how long have you had it ? 
we've had him for , 
let's see , he just had his fourth birthday . 
fourth birthday . 
and we got him when he was about eight weeks old 
and , uh , he's pretty okay , 
we like him . 
does he shed a lot ? 
that's the one thing we don't like about him . 
in fact , we threaten him in the summertime that we might just shave all of his hair off . 
he'd probably look pretty funny if we did that . 
how much does he weigh now ? 
actually , he just went to the vet yesterday to get his shots and everything , 
and they put him on the scale 
and he's up to ninety four now . 
but he's not a real tall , uh , dog for a golden retriever . 
he's kind of stocky , shorter and stockier . 
is he good with family ? 
it's , uh , just me and my wife 
and , uh , he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids . 
we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten . 
i can 
because i , 
get away with that a little bit more with pets than you can with kids .
how about you ? 
well , we have a cat who's also about four years old . 
and he also sheds a lot . 
but , uh , we hope to get a golden retriever someday . 
but we figure we'll get the kids and then the dog .
that's probably a good idea . 
they're good though . 
uh , have you ever had a retriever before ? 
because i find that they're good around other animals like cats and other dogs . 
they don't tend to get real jealous or territorial . 
they like to play . 
especially with the kids . 
they love to play with kids . 
is your dog an inside and outdoors ? 
he stays in . 
not a real busy neighborhood , but more so than i'd want him to be out too much 
and he doesn't like it if we tie him outside . 
oh , really ? 
he's really a wimp . 
and when it comes to being alone , 
uh , now if you give him the freedom to walk around and go wherever he wants , he likes that , 
but he does not like to be tied outside . 
he'll just bark and bark and bark . 
um , when he gets outside , does he run away and then eventually come back ? 
and , uh , he knows where our yard is 
and we have a pretty small yard , 
but he seems to know the boundaries . 
and he usually is good about staying within them , 
although our next door neighbors have a dog , too 
and , uh , she is good friends with my dog . 
oh , yeah ? 
and so he often gets to smelling her scent and will go over there to sniff around and stuff 
he stays out of the street 
and , uh , if i catch him i call him 
and he comes back . 
i trained him on my own 
and , uh , this is the first dog i've had all my own as an adult . 
or we've had dogs when i was a kid , 
but this is the first one that i , uh , took in , 
so i wasn't sure if i'd be able to get it all right the first time , 
but , uh , he seems to have picked it up pretty well . 
just , you know 
i see other people out there 
and they hit their dogs and try to , 
invisible fencing , 
least i , 
invisible what ? 
invisible fencing , 
have you heard of that ? 
what is that ? 
uh , it's a system you can put in your yard where you bury these little , uh , transducers or emitters in your yard 
and then they wear a collar with a special little attachment on it 
and if they get too close to that perimeter , 
i'd be afraid to walk around if i was that dog .
well , a friend of mine at work here said that he tried it with his dog 
and he wanted to see what he was subjecting his dog to 
so he held on to the collar 
and he walked out to the perimeter . 
he said it was a good jolt . 
oh , really ? 
and so , to those 
i don't think they're always necessary . 
if you put enough patience into , 
just be consistent and diligent 
and , um , 
somebody just told me that 
because of the leukemia ? 
that and also just , uh , getting hit , i guess , or getting beat up . 
and the average life span of an indoor cat is eighteen years .
quite a difference . 
uh , what kind of climate do you have ? 
well , uh , we just moved recently 
so now we're in the , uh , dallas area 
and it's 
the only experience i have , 
i don't have any children 
but i've , uh , i was a babysitter in high school . 
and then , just recently , after we were married , i babysat for a dentist while she worked . 
and i just , uh  . . . 
that's the only thing i've ever done also , is babysit . 
is it ? ery faint . 
but , uh , i've heard people that i work with talk about , you know , child care . 
especially , i guess it's even harder on single mothers . 
oh , yeah . 
the expense . 
having to pick up the kid by , you know , six o'clock 
or it's five dollars for every minute you're late . and stuff like that .
which is understandable . 
i mean , these people can't , you know , stay there till eight o'clock 
just sit around .
see the lady i did it for , 
that's why she picked me is because i would go to her house so she wouldn't have to get her little girl up . 
so she could sleep in . 
and , uh , then she could be at home 
and then i'd bring her to my house for a couple of hours if i wanted too or whatever . 
but , uh , she paid , i think it was two or , i think it was about two fifty , three dollars a hour 
and by the time i paid taxes on it , it , i was getting like eighty cents 
and that wasn't counting food or 
oh , no . 
it's hardly worth your time . 
yeah . 
that's pretty bad . 
the only time i babysat was in high school 
and it , you know , 
of course you don't ha , 
i didn't pay taxes on that , 
it was easy , you know , go over to some , uh , 
it was these people that lived in our neighborhood 
and i'd just go over there . 
every thursday night , they went to the theater . 
they had permanent tickets 
and they'd give me , 
it was supposed to be two dollars an hour for two kids , 
but they would usually give me like five dollars more at the end of the night . 
oh , wow . 
and , i mean , they'd , you know , 
it was great . 
i'd go over there 
and there's some oreos in the , in the cupboard . 
and there's some coke 
and you know , just help yourself to anything . 
that was a long time ago 
and that was only for a few years . 
just once a week . 
but i don't know . 
i think people that treat their babysitters like that get a lot better babysitters . 
oh , yeah . 
that's true . 
and they stick around for longer . 
and i quit  , you know . 
i was just like but i'm wasting my time . 
i really liked the little girl and everything 
but i thought  . . . 
she does take up , 
and they do take up a lot of your time . 
that  . . . 
i  . . . 
they're very demanding .
well , and she was really spoiled . 
they didn't make her eat anything she didn't want or anything . 
so , basically , they fed her cookies for breakfast and lunch . 
and the mom was a dentist 
but i don't want to make her eat something she doesn't want to eat .
that's right . 
so , i can see the concerns on what different people want . 
because some , 
i mean , you know , if i was setting up a daycare , there would be so many needs you would have to customize 
cause some parents won't put up anything . where others would . 
i think , 
i think the best way to go would just be to , to be able to do it out of your basement . 
and just have like t , at the most , like ten kids . 
and all from maybe people that you know 
instead of trying actually to set up a daycare where you don't know the people coming in and  . . . 
that's true . 
i , i'd love to do it . 
but i just don't trust people now . 
there's too many lawsuits . 
i just , i think it's a bigger risk than  . . . 
more than what it's worth ? 
yeah . 
it would scare me . 
i don't know , 
cause i'm sure some of them have good reason to sue 
but i think a lot of them are just , you know , they're negligent 
and they get happy about money 
well , yeah . 
when you have like a kindercare or something set up 
oh , yeah . 
and that's just , you know , 
you can't watch 
that's impossible . 
you know , you never know what they're going to get into . 
i have a girlfriend that works at a daycare 
and she takes her little girl with her 
and , i mean , she told me about half the people that they hire 
and half of them she'd like to turn them into the state .
and that's the people that are working there , you know . 
and then she would like to turn in half of the parents that drop their kids off because of the condition the kids are in , you know . 
oh , that's horrible . 
like they'll be in the same clothes they were the day before , the same diaper . 
you know , just awful things . 
and so i don't know . 
i don't have kids 
but i always think man i just don't know if i could trust anybody . 
i mean , you just don't know . 
that's i , 
that's a hard thing about it . 
if , i mean , i don , i can't foresee myself getting married 
but if , you know , if i ever wanted to have a kid , how could i work . 
i mean , i don't think i could trust somebody with my kid either . 
unless it 
oh , yeah . 
that's true . 
i just , i couldn't do it i don't think . 
it would just rip me apart , i think .
i don't know . 
just not knowing . 
just besides the fact that , you know , your , when your child gets out of school at three o'clock and then has to wait . 
what do you usually wear to , 
well , let's see . 
it turns out that , uh , tek , 
i work at tektronix 
and it's a very , uh , low key place as far as dress goes . 
you just wear , uh , 
let's see . 
when i first came here , i wore suits 
but after a while i got , uh , found out that that wasn't all that important . 
i'm an engineer . 
oh , i see . 
and , uh , so , i get to wear just , uh , how shall i say it , uh , walking shoes as 
well , that's nice comfortable stuff . 
open shirt , open at the neck , you know , no tie . 
and , uh , just , uh , reasonable looking , how shall i say it , uh , sports clothes or some guys wear , some people even wear levis . 
that's nice . 
well  , actually right now i'm a full time college student 
oh , okay . 
i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime . 
but over the summers i've had a job , internships with the newspaper . 
and that's   so , 
generally then i dress , you know , nicer . 
usually nice summer slacks or more , sometimes skirts , stuff like that . 
so , then it's still , you know , the emphasis is on comfort a lot because it's a lot of walking and coming in , out of the office 
but you still have to have a professional imagine kind of thing .
well i , uh , i just recently applied for a different job in the company here 
oh , really . 
and it , it was very interesting , 
uh , like i said , most of the people at , at this company don't wear suits . 
uh , most of the engineers and technical people are just very casual , almost the same clothes that , that you'd wear to school . 
that must be nice atmosphere then . 
although the new president and c e o of the company is from a much more formal eastern , uh , background . 
and so the result is that , uh , 
so anyway i wore this suit 
and i went over to , uh , uh , to one of the buildings that has a lot more of the financial people in it 
and it , and i , i was almost converted because , uh , the effect of that suit on the way people res , reacted and responded to me as opposed to the , 
uh , just to kind of , 
how shall i say it , 
they know you're there 
but they don't  , 
uh , you don't , 
there's no notice at all . 
but when i wore a suit that day , uh , it was obvious that people didn't know whether i was a worker bee or a manager . 
so people , uh , how shall i say it , made a , made much more effort to notice you , acknowledge your presence , say hello and , uh , things like that , 
that's interesting . 
it's like a mini , little study there .
that's really interesting . 
and so this dress for success thing , i think is , uh , 
by and large i've , i'm kind of , uh , convinced that , uh , by that , just that one , uh , uh , experience and then having talked to several other people that , that , uh , unless you're in a , an environment where they're going to make fun of , of , of 
that's interesting . 
doesn't mean they have to be , uh , 
how shall i say it , 
th , they don't have to be the , the most , uh , the absolute best 
but , uh , a little dressing a little bit above the standard , i think , would , uh , pay off 
so i'm in the process of telling my wife we got to go shopping for clothes again . 
that's neat , 
and , uh , i , i don't know , 
now i , i know eastern , 
now the other thing we do here , of course , is a single , not quite a single climate . 
we have , uh , we do have some snow in the wintertime 
and it can be quite warm in the summertime . 
not hot like , uh , 
i lived in the midwest for a while . 
and i know that , uh , you know , it can be freezing cold in the wintertime ,
we don't have that much . 
it's , uh , it's a very mild climate . 
oh , well that's nice . 
that's good for the clothes budget , i would imagine . 
because here , gosh , we had , uh , 
the winter hasn't been bad this winter . 
it's , it   it's only snowed maybe once or twice 
but it's been cold . 
low twenties , let's say , 
and then the summer gets up to eighties , nineties 
you interested in woodworking ? 
um , it just seems kind of funny that this is a topic of discussion . 
uh , i do , uh , some , uh , woodworking myself .
uh , in fact , i'm in the middle of a project right now making a bed for my son . 
um . what kind of 
but i cut it out in the shape of a crayon box 
and then i painted , uh , about eight different , uh , colors , uh , you know , 
the crayons that are sticking up , it will be the headboard 
i guess he's young . 
 and then , 
oh , he'll be delighted . 
oh , yeah . 
now i just have to finish it though . 
uh , because of work 
and now , uh , i've got to jump back in and finish the , 
because i've got it all cut out , 
it's all , uh , 
i've done most of the coloring 
but i've got to go a second layer with the yellow . 
uh , yeah . 
uh , i did , uh , jigsaw , uh , and the , uh , regular straight saw for some of it . 
so yeah . 
  to do [the turn cut . 
uh , how about yourself ? 
well i am interested in woodworking . 
i don't have lots of tools . 
our local schools have adult education in the evening 
 uh , and i use their tools [[and , some of their guidance . 
i'm an artist . 
oh , okay . 
and i'm very handy 
and , you know , if i touch it , it turns into something 
that's great . 
what type of art do you focus on ? 
i have a master's degree 
and my projects had to do with acrylic painting , 
but i'm really interested in the crafts . 
i make stain glass . 
i've done some silver jewelry making 
and i kind of , 
once i get you know , really pretty good at something , i want to try something else .
kind of jack of all trades , master of none . 
well no , 
that's great! 
and then it's like well the thrill is gone 
you want to , uh , explore a new field 
well , yeah , 
i'm signed up for a class in pottery making because i've never tried that yet 
huh . so you 
well , i actually have a masters of art 
and it's in art education . 
oh , okay . 
so , i'm a licensed teacher 
but jobs being what they are , i substitute teach 
 and that way i have time for my kids too . 
and i've been fortunate that i can afford to work parttime . 
i don't know how long that's going to last .
and , uh , they're cutting back , 
so i don't go in all that often 
uh , i see stuff in craft galleries for five hundred dollars 
and i go 
and i make it . 
that's how i started jewelry making . 
i love to cook . 
oh , that's great . 
and i saw a silver necklace that had these little teeny weeny silver spatulas [and a fork and all kinds of stuff 
 and i went 
and i signed up for class because then again , you you know , get someone to guide you 
and you get the tools you don't 
and i made a necklace that i saw in a gallery for three hundred twenty dollars .
it took me a lot of time 
oh , yeah . 
but if it cost me twenty dollars , you know , 
and then i , 
and your time , 
then you're that much farther ahead .
then i saw one of these country looking wood watermelons . 
it was a solid watermelon with a wedge cut out of it . 
i've seen them 
and then the watermelon , the red with the seeds painted in 
oh , yeah . 
that's neat . 
i went there , 
we have home depot out here . 
i don't know if you've heard of it . 
i went 
and i got 
i had to cut into slabs and build up this big square and turn it on the lath 
oh , i'm sure . 
uh , i did it 
a band saw ? 
and the teacher was one of these negative people , 
oh that's dangerous , 
we can't do that , 
we just can't do that . 
i want to do that , 
that was the plan here .
so we did get the wedge cut out by building some kind of 
a cradle for it . 
so you can steady it 
well , the instructions in the book i had said use a coping saw 
but there's no coping saw big enough for a fourteen inch wide watermelon that 
 and he wanted me to do it by hand with a regular saw . 
it's not going to happen . 
so we built a cradle for it 
and on the radial saw , 
by getting the other one out without the slice now flying in your face was something you had to think about .
now did you cut a quarter wedge in this ? 
you know jus , 
well , a watermelon like a log 
and then , uh , what i've seen of this kind before is you have [the , uh , 
it's , uh , 
if you're looking at adding on you have , 
up here in rochester , uh , we're the second cleanest metropolitan city as far as air pollution . 
i think grand rapids was number one . 
uh , we really don't have too much of a problem as far as , uh , industry since we're pretty technologically based as far as our industry in the city here . 
but we do have the same problem a lot of ar , other areas up here in the northeast have 
and that is the effects of acid rain .
well , tha , that's true . 
actually down here we don't have a big problem with , uh , with air pollution . 
mainly because we don't have anybody to th , to either side of us . 
uh , which helps out a lot as far as that goes . 
i wouldn't even necessarily thought of that except when i lived up in boston and up in , uh , you know , 
debates would come up up there in massachusetts and , you know , in that area over , uh , air pollution 
so why should we have to worry . 
i've , i've , uh , was in los angeles once 
and that was quite a difference as far as pollution goes . 
i mean you couldn't really see that much .
every once in a while we have these air inversions , the weather 
oh , yes 
and then it gets hazy around here 
but they're really , 
we don't have a big problem with it . 
i think that , uh , what most of the people here in new york state are going after right now is , 
it's , it's the , uh , ongoing acid rain problem . 
especially out in the , uh , uh , adirondack areas where , you know , the lakes are becoming , uh , changing the acidity of the lakes 
and we're having problems now because the fish are dying and certain acidic loving plants , uh , or alkaline liking plants are j , not lasting anymore because the soil levels , the p h is changing 
and i know that there's been battles over the states up here . 
uh , you know , governor mario going after , you know , governors of ohio and il , and indiana to fix what's going on down there . 
i remember when i was in florida , 
the only problem was that it seemed like it may , 
it wasn't really pollution , just the steamy weather .
oh absolutely , 
just muggy . 
so , yes 
i think , 
i think you're right . 
our most pollute substance down here is just water . 
but i 
you just got a lot of , you know , a lot of pollution from those 
and , uh , you know , if you don't have a wind , it sticks around . 
oh , yeah . 
i , you know , i was in boston once 
and i remembered seeing some of these things coming through at rush hour , even with the tee . 
uh , just this , it looked like billions of cars massing 
and if they sit there and then there's nowhere for the air to go . 
i mean , yeah , that's what's in , you know , los angeles is , 
i think that's biggest problem 
because when i was in los angeles for a time , it's all , you know , from los angeles to san diego it's like all city . 
and there's really , there's nowhere for this to be absorbed , really . 
uh , tree planting sometimes can handle , you know , stopping some of the air pollution and that and help 
but if you have nowhere to do anything . 
that's , that's very true . 
uh , you know , of course then when , when you're not recycling , you've got these incendiary plants and stuff , that can give you some pretty disgusting stuff going up in the atmosphere . 
but i , you know , you've got , you've got the industry , 
you've got that , 
and you got the cars . 
i think the cars are where , where it's at right now as far as pollution goes , air pollution i mean . 
i , you know , florida doesn't seem to be , at least maybe miami , 
but i , i , uh , you know , 
fort lauderdale i , i don't know what the big industries are down there , uh , 
but , you know , up here we have kodak 
and that's the worst polluter . 
they put , uh , uh , 
you can smell ether in the air sometimes .
it keeps the neighborhoods happy i guess . 
i guess so . 
uh , cause they clean the , uh , the lenses for cameras 
and they , they make film here 
and they're the worst offender 
but it's , you know , it's under so much control . 
you know , sulphur dioxide is the big emittant from them 
but that's really getting under control now . 
i , you know , i don't know in the air what they do . 
uh , i , i haven't run across any major pollutants down there that i've , i've really seen a lot of , you know , upsettedness about . 
uh , i , i know i've seen like , uh , 
my grandparents live in corpus christi , texas 
and i know they've , there's a lot of refineries down there 
and that , that's some pretty potent stuff they put up in the air . 
i , but i don't know how , uh , you know , 
there's a difference in what you can smell and what you , uh , you know , what's bad . 
be interesting to see when , as mexico develops industrially whether , you know , without ,
