so , do you play golf at all ? 
i'm a player . 
i'm kind of embarrassed i'm talking to a man , cause i'm sure that you play a lot more than i do . 
actually , i don't . 
oh , really . 
and i was horrible , 
so i just stopped playing . 
oh , well , my husband is a very good golfer . 
he has got , like a six handicap . 
that is real good . 
so , uh , 
and he has been playing since we have been married for twenty two years . 
so , i had to start playing because , he was , you know , such an avid golfer . 
so , i have been playing now , 
well i have had clubs for twenty years , you know . 
so you have been playing , 
but , i really enjoy it . 
so , i had to check that and , uh , talk about it . 
well , have you played recently ? 
that seems to have been a mistake , 
i don't know . um . 
oh , that's okay . 
i have not played in a long time . 
um , when i was , 
about five or six years ago , my dad  , who plays every now and then took me out with him 
 had a horrible slice or hook , 
i forget which one it was . 
it wound up tossing the ball into the trees ,
the slice goes to the right 
and the hook goes to the left , 
i think . 
i was slicing , actually . 
and a i got a little bit better , 
went back to school and did not have time and this and that , 
and the only thing i do now is i occasionally go out to a driving range and hit a couple of balls and see what i can do . 
and i , 
i think that's really a good thing to do . 
so , where ,
i mean , are you in school ? 
i'm a graduate student , 
oh , okay , 
at the university of rochester ? 
oh , great . 
as a matter of fact , um , i don't have time to do much else , except for graduate work . 
so i hang around this way , 
and i , 
occasionally , uh , uh , 
a bunch of us   were pretty avid golfers . 
and we will play , you know . 
and you don't , 
when i go on vacation , my father and i , uh 
but , i don't , you know , 
we play a par three , nine hole course . 
oh , that's my favorite kind to play . 
because , for a woman , it's really nice to play a par three course because ,
and , in fact , i don't even like to use a driver , 
i use a three iron off the tee 
and , i can just have better contact with the ball that way . 
so , i'm still using a three iron 
and my husband is trying to get me into using a , you ,
but , uh , i enjoy , 
i really do , 
i think i'm going to like golf   the older i get ,
we have three teenage daughters . 
uh , wow ,   .
one is , 
you must be very busy . 
i'm very busy , 
i have a part time job 
and during the year , i don't play much golf 
we are on vacation , i love to play . just like you said . 
and , we got to play in monterrey in california , right , you know , along the pacific ocean , this past spring . 
and i told my husband , that was the way to play , you know , 
that was , 
if i could play there every time i want , it was great . 
 a neat experience .
miniature golf , there's my game . uh . 
miniature golf is great , 
miniature golf , there you go , putt , putt . 
well , that's the thing my kids like to do that you know , on dates and stuff . 
but , golf is um , 
i don't 
i don't recall anymore . 
well , yeah , 
if you ever played , 
i mean , i feel like anybody that's ever played golf can talk about it 
and maybe if you can even talk about it , if you have , uh , watched it on t v . 
actually , we have a very very , um , 
we had the , uh , 
tell me about your clubs up there . 
well , we had , 
i haven't played around here too much . 
we have a very good one called locust hill though . 
there , uh , the l , 
the l p g a comes here every year 
and then we had a p g a , actually , a very big p g a , uh , tour stop here , last year . 
oh , great . 
and , actually , um , they say the , 
i have not played the course , 
but , they say the course is pretty tough , pretty challenging . 
and it's , um , not only that , 
but , it's exceedingly well kept , apparently . 
oh , yeah . 
because , those are the comments i kept hearing from the pros , you know , 
they kept saying , we hear , you know , on television   i , 
but , they keep saying it's just wonderful , uh , 
the course is so well maintained 
and , you know , it rained through half the um , tournament , so people had to    , 
but , they still , 
the grounds keepers were absolutely wonderful about ,
oh , yeah . 
and this , 
actually , um , when the l p g a came here 
 oh , sure . 
 you know . it's all over the news , 
to watch them , 
the ladies , 
so , i mean , i think it's absolutely wonderful to see . 
i'm sure the people love golf up there like they do down here . 
people are just cra , 
golf is just , 
it's just the coming thing , 
i mean a lot of people are just crazy about it . 
it seems to be . 
it seems a lot of people are really , you know , 
you have played it 
and you sort of stink , like me , 
and you sort of play every now and then . 
i mean i watch my husband 
and he was a professional athlete , 
he's a very good athlete 
and he's got the coordination , that god given coordination , 
and he just struggles ,
well , same here , i mean , i'm a brown belt in karate at this point in time . 
oh my , really! 
you know i , 
because it , 
well , i watch my husband swing 
and his swing , you know , like compared to the pros , is so , ridged .
it's like he's trying so hard , it's not that flowing movement .
or , how far he's going to hit it , i think , you know . 
oh yeah . 
and i worry about that . 
oh , yeah . 
i have just got to get this drive , you know , really far , 
i have got to hit it . 
i have this nasty habit   of turning my head at the last second , or , 
turning your head is probably the most common thing for women ,
is it ? 
and you are always so anxious to see where it goes . 
it's just like i don't watch the ball die , 
i have   .
it took me a long time to learn to wait until the ball was in the air before i looked up . 
i have to that , especially , even more so , with a short iron than a long ir , you know , 
oh ,   driver . 
because , those short irons , it's just , you want to look up 
and you want to see it hit the green . 
and you know that's why , 
watch where it's going . 
that is certainly true 
 thank you  .
i know that . 
that's okay , 
go ahead , 
it's no big deal . 
 well , uh , when i , 
 oh , really . 
have you ? 
  i had a   , 
i see . 
i see . 
 so   , 
well , my , uh , 
do you , uh , think we should go metric ? 
well , oh , i don't know . 
it's kind of a tricky question , because i think it's a practical system , 
obviously , if it's all compatible and it , you know , tens 
and things make sense . 
um , it's a switch . 
the problem would just be the switch over . 
i think what , 
i mean , i don't know what happened last time . 
i remember they tried it in the seventies at one point or something 
that's when i was in the elementary school years 
and we all , 
me too . 
and they were ready , 
we were going to be metric 
and i don't quite know why it failed . 
um , i bet the push just wasn't big enough . 
you know , they didn't sort of encourage , i mean businesses and things to use it , 
so , you know , and then start phasing things out 
so i think that's what they did at first ,
 i mean , and there's things that we've gone metric . 
we have metric cola now , 
i was just thinking ,
you can buy that 
and you can , 
you don't buy quarts and gallons anymore of soda . 
you know , so that , we have little things that are metric , 
but no one talks about , you know , uh , 
you buy nine by twelve frames , 
you don't buy centimeter length frames ,
and even though the car says miles and kilometers , 
you don't say , 
i went ,
 uhhuh  .
fiftynine kilometers per gallon . 
i would be total loss . 
i think , though , if there were some , you know , sort of government incentive program or something 
and i think there would be the hard core older people who would get really pissed 
and , pardon my expression there , but , uh , 
but i think in the end it would make life a lot easier for 
it really would . 
it's , because i think they had a good try there when they started with us in the elementary schools , trying to , you know , get that in our minds , so that we could ch , i mean 
because i think our generation could make a change . 
it would be difficult , 
but it would not be as difficult for people , say , fifty years old now who have never been exposed to the metric system other than , you know , buying a two liter coke . 
that's  , 
well , what i think the difference between now and then might be , this is just a might , is we were the first generation that was   in elementary school . 
and if they kept it up , 
so let's say , imagine they had kept going , 
you'd have , you know , two or three more generations that all now are familiar with the metric system . 
not like could use it comfortably right now , 
but i could convert , you know , 
i could carry around a little conversion card or something 
and i think that before , it was you know , just a bunch of little kids using it . 
and now i think there are enough people , 
you know , sort of as we get older , i think others that will bring more generations in on it , eventually they'll be able to make the switch , 
but it's for the better 
and we'll sort of deal with it , i think . 
that's true . 
that makes sense . 
i don't know . 
i would hope it would , uh , 
it seems like it's a reasonable system . 
i mean , everything seems to be based on the same thing . 
well , i was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change , 
and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license . 
when you wouldn't be five foot eight anymore , uh , you'd be a hundred and seventy centimeters , 
centimeters . 
and then you'd be lighter in kilograms than you were 
but i wonder if , 
so all the dieters would be happy .
 but yeah 
i only weigh sixteen today . 
but i wonder if that's even something that , you know , they have to change immediately . 
they could just , you know , sort of phase that in , 
so start , you know , from now , 
like from now on all licenses would have that ,
and they'd have to change that little ruler that's on the door of the seven eleven that ,
that's right . 
i know the , 
and , oh , yeah , 
you have to be under . 
well , i bet what they do in that case , they , uh , 
  this line , which is seventythree centimeters . 
that's right . 
just so you'll know , 
it would be a neat case where like , where kids taught the parents , i think , you know . 
because isn't it pretty much everywhere in the world ? 
i know england is not metric . 
but i don't know . 
england is not ? 
all that began back there , 
and i think they're the only part of the continent that hasn't changed over to metric . 
but i mean , 
but virtually the rest of the world is . 
i mean , it seems like 
i mean , of course , we are americans 
and we're supposed to be , you know , 
we're the trend setters in the world . 
i don't know why we , 
that's right , 
and now we're backwards . 
i don't know . 
a base ten system as compared to a base twelve system 
well , and it's not even base twelve for everything , 
is it ? 
actually , no . 
um , let's see , 
well , pounds , 
i don't even know what that , 
i don't know . 
i always forget . 
i don't even know how many ounces are in a pound . 
i just sort of make it up . 
see , and i don't understand liquid ounces and fluid ounces . 
i mean , i don't know that i have that much concrete knowledge in the current  ,
those   wouldn't be a problem . 
it's not like it's really entrenched other , you know . 
a lot of stuff , 
let's see , 
how many cups equal that ? 
i have no idea . 
i just , uh , 
i don't , 
that's all i know . 
i learned that because , uh , a friend of mine , 
i had two friends , 
and , i had more friends than that , 
but two friends of mine in college , 
i had a lot more than two , 
well , that's good . 
um , we opened a jelly bean business . 
and we sold jelly beans , 
and we had , uh , no idea how many , you know , 
we didn't bother buying a scale . 
we'd go out and just buy , you know , five pound bags of sixteen different flavors , put it in plastic shoe boxes and then sell them for x amount per pound or quarter pound or something . 
and one of these guys was a physics major 
and  he got  the measuring cup and just measured , i think a cup or two cup , whatever is a pint . 
did you ever check it to see if it really was ,
gee , i think , wh , 
and it turns out that he was actually pretty close . 
if anything , we were actually in favor of the consumer . 
so we were giving them a little too much , 
but that was our general tendency anyway . 
well , that's , 
you all are   nice business .
well , you know , we were in , 
it was almost like we did it for the hell of it in school , 
we really didn't ,
i think we were only making seventyfive dollars each profit at the end of the year .
but we had a hell of a lot of fun doing it . 
probably ate all your merchandise too . 
we tended to eat a lot , 
and our friends would just sort of walk by and just put their hands in it , 
and we had another friend , um , the physics major again , 
and he got into a snowball fight ,
and he just , 
and some snow fell into one of the cartons . 
so he brought them into the bathroom to wash them off .
and basically what we had , sort of non coated beans at that point . 
it's a little problem . 
what's inside the jelly bean ? 
uh , the same , 
they're like an outer coating , 
and there's just sort of this stuff you see , you know , it's sort of like glorified sugar . 
i don't know . 
uh , oh . 
but when you rinse them off , all you get uh , is , uh , the coating , 
it's , uh , 
the , uh , 
maybe i'm a hard liner 
but i think that there should be some preset penalties in criminal cases . rather than , uh , degrees of sentencing . 
you mean the crimes or the punishment should fit the crime ? 
uh , again , having participated in jury duty myself ,  , 
i did also . 
could you hang on one minute jim ? 
yes ma'am . 
thank you .
i am so sorry to keep you on hold . 
no problem . 
are you at work ? 
i am too . um , 
um , i think what you have is , the way the justice system works is they bend over backwards trying to protect the guilty . 
 oh , it's insane . 
so many things in their back , 
i know , 
my wife participated in a jury trial several years back 
oh yes . 
and yet , the attorney , 
it was like ,
whereas , uh , 
it seems like    , 
those that should be in jail should be in jail .
that's correct 
and there's too much leniency , 
there's too much , uh , um , underhanded , uh , things going on that the public are not aware of . 
and it seems as though we are , uh , giving the criminal the benefit , more than the victim . 
the victim has been victimized twice , not only by the perpetrator of the crime but also ,
well , i think this is one of the reasons that also that attorneys have such a , unsavory reputation , 
shall we say ? 
the judicial system in 
well , what you got is the situation wherein , uh , if you ever get in trouble , you want to hire the smartest , crookedest , lawyer you can find . 
isn't that terrible ? 
and , uh , that's not the idea . 
the idea is not to get the guy off of the crime ,
to get him out of that , uh , uh , criminal mind that he has and to direct ,
well we have , uh , a situation again that i am familiar with where , uh , the son of an acquaintance of mine 
how sad . 
 and the person that killed him was a young woman who had left the house with full intent to commit crimes , carrying a gun in her purse . 
 and , anyway it'd get to the , 
she was sentenced to jail 
but then due to technicalities , she was going to be out of jail within eighteen months after she was sentenced . 
of course it took eighteen months for the trial to happen . 
so , then , uh , 
and the parole board received approximately a thousand letters protesting putting this person back on the street within eighteen months after killing someone . 
and , uh , fortunately it worked . 
they corrected the technicality . 
well if , 
 and the person now will have to serve three to four years of the seven or eight they were sentenced to . 
if enough of the public ,
they will listen to the voice of the people . 
i have found that out . that if enough people respond and rise up against the injustices being done , something is going to change . 
people have to be involved . 
this is it 
 and most people don't take the time . 
that's right . 
again the only reason i took the time is because i was personally acquainted 
that's right . 
i'm just 
you were , 
uh , but , and i'm not making an excuse 
but our priorities are a bit backward . 
oh yes . 
well , they , again the , 
and i'm not knocking the civil rights program or anything like that , 
but we've gone ,
it's again the victim gets worse punishment then the person ,
that's correct . 
i think we're both in agreement on this subject . 
well , i am too . 
 i mean i just can't . 
you know , i served on a jury for a lady that was having a mental problem 
and we found her not because the lady obviously was not in their right mind . 
so if the person is not in the right mind , i mean they had to , uh , put her away . 
but for her own safety and because she didn't know what she was doing . 
and we just dismissed the case .
and , she was , uh , taken care of by the proper facility . 
well another side of the coin with our justice system there are a lot of frivolous cases that go to court . 
there are a lot of things that could be settled out of court 
that's true . 
and then the amazing thing , of course , is how , uh , some cases can come to trial in thirty days , 
and others it takes eighteen months .
carolyn , i have a little miniature schnauzer . 
what do you have ? 
well , it's kind of a mixed breed that we got from the humane society .
you know , those make the best pets . 
my , uh , son has uh , oh , 
it's a real mixture , 
it's part , uh , doberman and part husky .
oh , my . 
and gentlest dog you ever met , 
and they got him from the , uh , humane society here in oklahoma city 
 and she's just turned out to be a jewel . 
is my friend . 
she is so spoiled . 
she's a year and a half old now , 
and being single , she's become very important in my life 
it's so nice to come home and find something , or someone who's really so happy to see you . 
well , my children are the ones that wanted our pet , 
and this one is probably the best one that we have had . 
um , as i say , we got it from the humane society , 
and , uh , we had lost a pet , 
and we really went there looking for the one that we had lost . 
it got out under the fence while we were on vacation , 
and we just looked all over for it and couldn't find it , 
but , uh , when we walked in to the humane society , this little dog was , uh , in the office and would sit up and beg , 
and just , oh , he was so cute , 
and the kids just fell in love with it . 
we just couldn't leave without it . 
but , you know , it's , uh , a good house dog . 
i've never had one that i could keep in the house before and tolerate it .
sometimes i wish i had not gotten this one , it's a puppy , because i work 
and i'm not home 
 and unfortunately she's not as well trained as i would like her to be 
 and i realize it's my fault , 
i'm not doing a really great job as a disciplinarian , 
but , uh , 
it's hard to do that when you're not there constantly , 
it is , 
you know , she's real good , 
i can leave her all day in the bathroom 
and , not one mess does she make 
 and then we go outside , 
and she'll stay outside for , oh , thirty minutes to an hour , come inside and use the restroom . 
i just want to kill her at 
but she's a doll , 
she's a love , 
she really is . 
about the only time we have , 
well , i shouldn't say the only time , 
but most of the time when we have problems with restroom is in the night , 
and , uh , she usually stays inside at night . 
we try to take her out right before we go to sleep , 
but , uh , sometimes it doesn't work .
you know , we always had a pet when i was growing up , oh always had a dog . 
my mother did not like cats . 
so we always had a dog , 
and then , course , when my children were growing up , we always had a dog , and always said it was because the children wanted the pet 
 and i find that i'm enjoying this one far more than i ever did when it was the children's dog , 
this little puppy for christmas . 
what a cute idea . 
i think so .
well , we got one one year for christmas , 
and , uh , i had a baby the next day 
oh , my goodness . 
 and , uh , so 
two babies , 
oh , i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time , 
that is really probably bad timing . 
i thin , 
it was , 
it really was . 
the older kids had wanted one , though , 
and , you know , we thought , well that would be a fun time for them to you know , get it at christmas time . 
it was a little spitz , wi , a little white 
oh , yes , 
and that was fun , 
but , um , i sure wasn't good at training it 
do you 
i think you have to have time , you know 
and patience 
 and you really have to be , just like your children , 
when you set a rule you have to stand by it , and be consistent 
that's right . 
 and  . . . 
well , um , since i'm in college , uh , i mean , uh , i haven't seen that much change .
i'm kind of young still , 
i don't know how much it changed in the last , uh , twenty years anyway . 
but , i don't know . 
of how much . 
i'm only twentynine . 
oh , okay . 
so , social changes aren't that much for me either . 
well , i can remember are from , from my childhood were the disco days 
and maybe that's changed a lot . uh 
well , yeah , 
and , uh . 
i think attitudes are more lax now than they used to be . 
maybe a people are a little more openminded than maybe they used to be . 
i think so . 
and a lot , 
i think people 
especially with like a lot of the different organizations now like , you know , prolife in the special interest groups maybe 
uh , yeah , 
maybe people are a little more , uh , free to express their opinions , socially free . 
i think so . 
i think women have come out more 
oh , yeah . 
i think that's become more outstanding than it used to be where women , i think used to be a little bit afraid of coming out and saying something . 
just wasn't socially acceptable . 
uh , on relationships has changed , you know , 
and you know , we have to worry about aids 
and we have to worry about , uh , maybe people are becoming more afraid of 
well , i know like when i was in high school and junior high and stuff and sitting down and having the sex talk with mom , you know 
and , you know , we didn't have to talk about , 
 but , i'm not naive ,
it wasn't that long that i was that young . 
and i've got a ten year old , 
and , you know , he thought , he knows about condoms , 
it used to be that we were trying to protect morality . 
now it's we're protecting our lives . 
we have , you know , 
you can't just hope for abstinence . 
i think that's stupidity on parents' part . 
i mean 
and it always will be , 
i mean , the boys are very open 
but they talk about things that my brother didn't talk about until he was in college 
and they sit down 
and they look at you right in the face 
and they expect a truthful answer . 
that's right . 
you can't give them , the , oh , you know , cabbage patch answers 
that just does not go . 
and they can tell me , basically some things that i don't know .
but it's interesting , listening to them . 
i think the social changes in them , i think i see it more with that generation 
i imagine you're right . 
i teach swim lessons a lot , 
and , and to they're open about , well , you know , 
kids are a lot more educated now than i think that , like we were , uh , at that age 
i do too . 
you know , uh , their education is just amazing . 
kids are learning , uh , you know , 
their math is just , 
every year , uh , algebra goes down a grade , you know , 
and , uh , students learn it earlier . 
i know , 
well , my son , my fourth grader , he is , 
uh , which ones have you seen lately ? 
oh , i just sort of blanking tonight . 
i just got done saying i just saw one , uh , fairly recently . 
uh , oh , gosh , oh , i know , uh , uh , the one with the two girls that take off from , uh , uh , across the country on a crime spree . 
thelma and louise , 
thelma and louise , 
i haven't seen that . 
is it good ? 
it's interesting . 
is it ? 
oh , yeah , 
i was going to go see , uh , the billy crystal movie , also , which was , 
i'm a little bit behind . 
i usually rent them .
i'm not familiar . 
which billy crystal movie ? 
oh , this is the , 
uh , just the one , oh , 
it was the , uh , 
oh , city slickers , 
that's a real good show . 
have you seen that ? 
uh , it says a lot about , uh , uh , you know , 
i'm young , 
 but it says a lot about middle life 
and , uh , uh , it's a really good show . 
i've heard lots of good things about it 
and i would have liked to have seen it , 
but i was with my wife 
and i figured she'd like thelma and louise better 
and i'd heard it was really good , too 
uh , yeah , 
i'm not too familiar with thelma and louise . 
uh , uh , uh , recently i've seen , uh , the fisher king . 
have you seen that ? 
it's a really good show . 
uh , has jeff bridges and , uh , robin williams . 
uh , really , really good . 
of pretty good movies out recently . 
i mean it kind of runs in , in batches , 
i mean , for a while , sometimes they come in a whole bunch of them that just , i don't even , you know 
what kind of movies in general do you like to watch ? 
uh , well , i like to be entertained once in a while 
but , a real good movie . 
uh , it always , 
my favorite movie of all time has been , uh , uh , the mission . 
did you ever see that ? 
i don't think . 
uh , it's a  , 
i think it's put out by landmark productions , the same people who put out chariots of fire . 
uh , it's a , 
has robert deniro in it . 
uh , he plays one of the main characters 
and , uh , it's about , uh , jesuit community in , uh , south america , northern argentina . 
oh , uhhuh 
uh , really , really good show . 
in fact , i'll look for it because i  , 
it's something that , you know , 
it's really stirring . 
the cinematography is just beautiful and really beautiful scenes and real good music . 
actually yeah , 
my wife's from down in that region where i'm sure where it was filmed at . 
and , uh , 
has changed a lot since i got married . 
oh , yeah ? 
and so anything has anything 
i used to watch a fair number of foreign films . 
i used to watch a lot of , sort of , the less popular films . 
and i find i don't do it anymore or else i have to watch them on my own . 
i'm much the same way . 
i have a fiance 
and , it gets very difficult to , uh , uh , 
find something both of you will watch . 
it's funny because most women aren't really , 
she's sort of schwarzenegger fan type of . 
oh , really ? 
keep her on the edge of her seat . 
i'll watch them , you know , 
they're kind of fun to watch in a way . 
they are . 
sometimes you're in the mood for it even . 
 but , uh , so it varies , 
i don't seem to get , you know , as much variety these days lately 
i found we usually rent , uh , good gladiator movie or two .
uh ,   i still enjoy watching those . 
you can't just watch them by yourself or else ,
but it's fun to , 
well , yeah , 
on the other hand , you know , given that my wife likes those , say , i occasionally like to watch them 
you can always count on her to watch something like that .
and she'll even watch things like karate movies and stuff like that .
oh , yeah ? 
they won't come within ten feet of ,
that's great . 
uh , uh , on foreign films did you watch , 
are you , uh , fluent in another language 
i s , 
but , i don't mind watching subtitle movies . uh , 
oh , you don't ? 
i don't either . 
i don't speak another language fluently 
but i do enjoy watching 
i mean , for some people , that's just , you know , that's out of the question , you know . 
you give it subtitles , they won't watch , 
lucille , i'm on   .
all right , 
 and what , 
all right , 
i guess i'm probably a lot like you . 
i'm a dallas maverick fan . 
well , i certainly am too . 
now tell me what you expect from the mavericks this year . 
well , unfortunately , i don't expect a great deal out of them . 
they just have too many problems , too many ailments , too many hurt bones , and maybe too much age at this point . 
you know , when roy tarpley just now he messed up on them , it just hurt them so bad . 
i feel 
i feel sorry for donald carter and the members of the team and the management team and everyone else . 
it just seems like they were just getting themselves in a position where they could possibly be a final team playing for all of it . 
yes , sir . 
national championship or the world championship , and something like this happens . 
well , do you think it's time that we go for new , uh , coaches ? 
is that part of our problem ? 
i think that probably be evident with the more and more young guys they draft . 
well , it just , it's so discouraging that they can't really , 
i mean , they're entitled to more than they've been able to do so far . 
and do . 
roy , who's your next best team , 
or who do you like after the mavericks ? 
i'm so much a maverick fan i don't know . 
probably the boston celtics . 
i've just always like the boston celtics . 
they have a similar situation in that a lot of old guys on the team , 
and , but they're still playing good ball . 
but i've always been a boston celtic fan , too , 
but , you know , i've lived in texas since seventyfour , 
so being a transplanted texan in the dallas area , i have to stick with those dallas mavericks . 
we certainly need to support them , 
do we not . 
do you go to the game ? 
i haven't been to many . 
i'm not a season ticket holder or anything . 
i was a season ticket holder of the cowboys for years , 
and when my kids got to a certain age and went off to school and college and doing their own thing , sort of gets boring going by yourself .
it does .
i'm sure it would in such a monstrous place down there . 
oh , you bet . 
but , um , maybe they can do some . 
i don't know , 
who do they need to trade ? 
well , i don't know . 
it seems like rolando blackman and harper sort of carry the team , 
they just , 
i don't know , 
i'm afraid to say , that's probably who they need to trade to get someone in there good , 
but , and that can really help the team , 
but they do that , 
they trade the nucleus of their power right now . 
yes , sir , 
it seems that way to me . 
course i don't know any of the newer ones that they have 
and i'm not well versed on their capabilities , 
but we really need to do something . 
well , you know , i feel like , uh , the best they can hope for this year is probably an opportunity to make the playoffs . 
i like their coach . 
i really like   a lot , 
and i think he deserves a good break . 
i think he deserves a healthy team so they can really see what he can do for the club . 
donald carter , the owner , i think with all he's invested , he deserves a 
i really . 
yes , sir . 
this thing with roy tarpley just upset everyone , i think . fans , owners , management , everyone . 
and they have just done as much as they can for that man , 
and he apparently can't straighten his act out , 
so we need to build on something more positive than that . 
you bet . 
i think they're fools if they ever bring him back .
oh , i do , too . 
i certainly would agree to that . 
hate to put it that way . 
i just would not believe him any more . 
well , it , um , 
i mean , you can't give , anyone too many chances 
 and i think he has gone over the limit . 
but you can't make him drink . 
that's right . 
and i think tarpley's just a sad case . 
but to be making a million dollars a year , that's pretty sad . 
it is tragic . 
i don't , um , 
i mean , we're going to have to do something about all of these fabulous salaries they're paying to all of our athletes , i think . 
oh , i think you're right . 
everything has been put out of perspective now . 
you know , you take a young kid roy tarpley's age , i'd say he was twentyone when he came into the league , 
and now he's probably an old age of , uh , twentyfive or six 
yes , sir . 
well , they need at that point in their life , i think . 
i think you're right . 
i believe that one , 
i think , you know , it's created by , 
um , are you from this area ? 
i'm from dallas . 
i'm in garland , 
 well , i'm in dallas right now , 
but i live in garland . 
um , well , i don't know if you know , 
but garland has got a real big recycling center that , in fact , we went to it yesterday . 
you drive up 
and you take the stuff out of your trunk , 
and they have different bins for the different materials , like clear ,
and , uh , they have all the different plastics separated by those little symbols on the bottom . 
that's pretty neat . 
my daughter is four , 
and she's real interested in recycling . 
so we're trying to promote that , because she thought we just put them in a special trash can and threw them away , 
but , we went to the recycling center to show her what we actually did with them . 
uh , does dallas have a curbside recycling program yet ? 
um , well , i don't know dallas , 
 richardson does . 
oh , okay . 
um , they started with newspapers and , uh , of course aluminum cans , and 
i didn't know there were different types of plastic , though . 
um , like soda bottles are one type of plastic , 
and milk jugs are one type of plastic . 
you can te , 
it's got little , 
most of the recyclable containers have the little symbol on the bottom with the arrows around it 
it's just different kinds of plastics , like the clear plastic is different from that milky looking plastic . 
oh , okay . 
and that's what the different types are . 
it seems to be made out of something different . 
i know there's a long scientific name 
but it's like polytechnochloride and all that fun stuff . 
um , i don't know if they do it all over , 
but our kroger does a newspaper recycling every saturday . 
you can drive up , 
and they have one of newspaper out of your car , 
and they'll put it in their little bin , 
and they do the recycling , 
i mean , they collect the newspapers and their plastic grocery bags 
that's something since we all seem to have an abundance of those plastic grocery bags .
that's right . 
 i know we use them for trash can liners and 
lunch bags . 
in fact i have one today . 
the only problem with those is sometimes they get holes in the bottom . 
they do . 
now , i , 
in fact did you happen to see twenty twenty the other night ? 
uh , no . 
they did a program , 
or one of their articles was on recycling , 
and , uh , it was actually on a town that has a dump that they charge other cities , or towns to come in and dump their trash there . 
they have made so much money from that , that they bought a brand new fire engine , 
and when the fire engine was delivered the fire house wasn't big enough , so or built a new one 
they have built up one mountain . 
they call it mount trashmore 
they built up one mountain , covered it with grass , and put ski lifts on it , 
and in the winter they put snow on it , 
and they charge to ski on it . 
so the city gets the money from that , 
they built a golf course at the bottom , 
and they get the money from that . 
i's like , 
it's , riverview , ohio or some place up there . 
but i thought it was a pretty neat idea . 
i mean , their city hall looked better , 
it was nicer than dallas' , 
and they only have fourteen thousand people in the city . 
and they like the trash . 
well , okay .
but i thought it was pretty neat . 
it would be nice if more communities could do that , 
but , you have to know from beginning , 
and you have to have the space to do it 
they'll run out of space before long . 
see , that's , 
well they're already planning a second mountain . 
so , they're going to be called the twin peaks . 
it would be nice if more communities could get really involved in recycling .
i know , i've got a two year old and a four year old , 
and that's , 
my daughter thinks that any time she sees newspapers bundled up , they're being recycled . 
so that , like , 
and you make them into new things , 
and you get the paper all wet 
and you make it into new paper , 
um , so do you all go ahead , 
they don't even know that paper comes from trees now , 
well , yeah , 
how do you grow paper ? 
and how do you grow aluminum ? 
well , let's see , um ,  , 
we really don't , 
well , you crunch it up real small 
and then you melt it down . 
well , what if it breaks ? 
well , okay , .
it was an interesting weekend trying to explain all that fun stuff to her . 
but at least she knows that that is something that people need to be doing , 
and she got our babysitter to start recycling her newspapers and cans , because that's all she talked about . 
so , i guess what , 
well , i think some of the blame can be placed on plea bargaining and people getting less time and not serving any of the , or a lot less of the ,
but , i don't know , 
with the economy the way it is , i think crime can't do much but go up . 
i have to agree with you . 
i had occasion a couple years ago to hear the chief of police of richardson , texas speak 
and , you know , it's a shame  , and he does this for a couple of years , hides all the stash and works off of it 
and then when he gets caught , he'll be sentenced to something like five to seven years , 
but he gets five days credit for every day he serves . 
i mean , it's like a bonus to go to jail . 
i mean , what he does , the chief said is he just merely goes back to his stash where he has it hidden and continues to operate 
and , uh , when he uses up all that and spends all that money , then he , uh , starts robbing houses again or whatever and gets caught again and goes through the same thing . 
well , there was an article in our paper sunday that the average person sentenced to seven to ten years in north carolina , serves six weeks .
now , see , you talk about , that's a crime right there . 
well , see , we don't have any room in our prisons 
well , we don't either , in texas . 
they shuttle them in and shuttle them out 
and they get them early parole in order to make rooms for the new criminals who stay there for their six weeks 
and then they're paroled , uh , to make room for the newest criminals 
and it's just really absurd . 
well , it certainly is , 
and , uh , that would be a huge concern . 
you know , i don't think the general public really realizes this as far as what goes on with our criminal system , our judiciary system and everything else . 
uh , it's terrible the way it is right now . 
i think the general public is so overwhelmed by things right now , so many different things coming in so many different directions that they've just decided to become apathetic towards it all because they realize there's abs , 
or they think that there's absolutely nothing they can do about it . 
as far as steps to reduce crime , if it's , uh , crimes like we're just been discussing , obviously we need more prisons and more corrective facilities to put these people in 
but i don't think that's going to happen because , just like you said , 
and our state's a good example , 
your state's a good example 
and , it's just not going to happen . 
as far as the murderers , and people that commit rape and things like that , i'm not sure what's right , 
but i know it , 
it's not right to put them in there and let them live for years and years and has to be very costly to feed a prisoner and to 
and , you know , i'm sure he gets to watch a lot of t v 
and i'm sure they have , uh , exercise facilities and movies 
and everything else , you know , they can have a good time in . 
well , i don't know what the answer is , 
but i know that asking the question over and over and over again isn't working 
it really isn't . 
a big , 
it's a big problem 
and hopefully something will come out of it . 
so , i don't know . 
i hope so . 
uh , i believe in capital punishment , 
i mean , you know , a person rapes a kid or shoots someone or kills someone , 
i mean , you know , if it's just downright , outright , 
oh , i definitely believe in capital 
you bet , 
i mean , that's the only way to , 
curious about . 
oh , yeah , 
and you spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to , uh , take care of them and all , you know , 
it's just unbelievable . 
you can appeal now in north carolina for almost a period of twenty years . 
can you really ? 
 uh , the average is eight to ten years to get in to the north carolina supreme court 
 and then , uh , after that it goes to the supreme court of the united states 
and that usually takes another four to six years . 
 oh , i know . 
so it's  , 
meanwhile , you're living in a country club situation perhaps , you know . 
they're hoping , 
i guess they're trying to prolong their lives and hoping people will forget what they did . 
but it's just a , 
we have a serious problem . 
we have so many problems in this state now 
the thing is the , the thing , 
the drug problem , that's another one . 
the fundamental problem is , 
uh , yeah , 
and now i'm sort of , don't know if this an advantage or disadvantage . 
my wife's a school teacher 
so  , 
you go right ahead because i , 
my wife teaches seventh grade , 
and , you know , there is a lot of serious things wrong with the school system today and the teaching system . 
i think the , 
i don't think the teachers get enough support , quite honestly . 
but , uh , for example , my wife , she has kids that are on drugs , 
and , of course , like everyone , she has kids that get pregnant even in the seventh grade . 
what school system does she teach in ? 
plano school system . 
oh , wow . 
but to give you an example , uh , you know , one of her kids will come in and you could tell he was just bombed out on drugs , 
and , uh , she sends him to the principal's office , 
you're not allowed to send them home . 
you know , if you do that , then your allocation's cut from the state or the feds or whatever , 
you have to have a certain amount of kids in your class every day , 
and , it's a numbers game . 
i don't think that's right , especially if they're interrupting the class and preventing other kids from learning . 
there's a bigger problem here than , uh , than discipline in the schools . 
i think it gets back to the , uh , parental participation into the program . 
um , to give you an example , both of my children are in the academy system in the garland school district , 
and it's a public system , however , you'd think that it was a private school , because i take it , the best teachers and the best students , 
they're taking top three percent that have tested out , you know , in the district and , uh , put them in this academy system , 
and to get into the system's very difficult . 
but once you're in , uh , they have , they have selfpaced programs , 
and so you have students that want to learn 
and , uh , you have teachers that want to teach , 
and you have parents that are really interested in the children , 
and basically , uh , there's probably some discrimination if you want to say that 
and most of , 
that's not all true , 
but i'm saying a large percentage of them are ,
and also the other large percentage is that all the parents just about , of these kids , uh , have college degrees , at least one parent does . 
and so there's , 
oh , yeah . 
my son had such a tough time in , uh , the school he went to 
but , there was through , 
it wasn't all the school's fault , 
it was his fault also , 
but we put him in a private school in richardson , 
and that cost more , 
that was five thousand dollars a semester for three semesters , 
that was more than his college tuition was 
 but , uh , it had to be done , 
at least it took care of him and , uh , threw him in a good learning situation where he did participate and , uh , want to learn something . 
but i'll tell you what , there are a few faults , to say the least , in the school systems today . 
i think what we've done is , um , um , especially looking at , um , the south dallas area , is that we're trying to bring the education level down to the lowest level so that the lowest level can succeed . 
i think we have that problem dealing in most areas , which is unfortunate . 
and , um , that also probably crosses over into business , because now , businesses also say that if you're don't have the proper education , uh , including , uh , exposure to high tech fields 
you bet . 
you bet . 
so i think that the school system proliferates over to the business world 
and then educ , 
and what we've done is caused a big problem that proliferates itself . 
well , teachers , you know , they have a , a tough row to hoe , so to speak , always fighting the system . 
i don't know if it's better than any , 
you know , we came down to texas from the , uh , new york area , 
we were there for a short time , 
but my wife is from new york , 
and she was born and raised there , and educated there , college and everything , 
and i think , you know , the schools in the east are really a whole lot better than the schools in the south , i don't care where you're from . 
and they , 
i don't know if they learn more , 
but uh , they have a tendency to learn more , 
and in that part of the country there is all nationalities , 
what do you think has occurred there ? 
well , i think one of the major changes is the whole attitude towards women in the work place and the role of women in doing jobs outside of the home . 
that's probably one of the major changes i see over the last period of time . 
but what they have to accept that's they are responsible for . 
uh , responsibilities is what i am trying to say . 
 but i still think in lots of job markets they are not treated as equals . 
in other words , in some respects the other direction , in some job markets they don't really want to be treated as equals . 
i think that's 
is that right and wrong ? 
and i think that's what we really ought to look at that , if they are going to do equal work they ought to get equal pay . 
and uh , they ought to have equal opportunities to advance to those positions 
 and i don't think that we have gotten there yet . 
well , what changes do you think are most significant over the past few years ? 
any individual thing 
oh , boy . 
 or is it just a general switch over ? 
i think it's generally that switch over . 
and i think that switch over has been more in the work force . 
i don't think that women are treated as equals in the home as much as they are in the work force . 
i think those women who are out working are probably still expected to carry more responsibility at home 
so they have one and three quarters jobs now . whereas the husbands have one and a quarter . 
and this upsets the man because we have always been built to think that we were sort of head of the household . 
so do you think that is going to be uh , difficult saying as far as marriages and people enjoying each other 
i think there is going to be some increasing problem because i think women are expecting husbands to do more parenting 
and i am not sure they are becoming more skilled at it . 
so i think it really has put some additional stresses on the family units . 
well , do you have any opinion of potential changes that may occur in the next generation ,
 and then i think we are starting to see now some tendency of women at mid thirties 
and so the opinion of this career thing isn't all that it is cracked up to be 
and i want to go back and do something else . 
i think we will probably see the pendulum in terms of the work force swing back a little bit . 
also , much of it is driven by economics right now . 
people have gotten out and gotten use to incomes coming in . 
well , i actually , mo , 
a lot of women are being hired now instead of men because they can get brought in at lower salaries because that's what everybody else assumes they are going to get . 
and the people . 
well , how do you feel about women in , uh , armed services ? 
well , i think they ought to have the right . 
i have some problems with my own family thinking about or my wife and my daughter going into combat 
 but i have problems with men doing that 
and i guess if they want to they ought to have the right to do it . 
it's nothing i would be greatly enthusiastic about pushing for it . 
i somehow can't do that 
and the men went out and took responsibility of earning the money , bringing in whatever they needed and protected the household 
and it really still bothers me . 
i spent plenty of years in the service , 
but it still bothers me to see ladies out in combat or actually out in places where there is two or three of them there and five hundred men around . 
i mean how are they going to protect themselves so to speak . 
i agree . 
it puts them in a very bad situation . 
i really don't go for that . 
i think one of the other things that has concerned me a little bit , 
and i think i see some change in attitudes there . 
my wife happens to be a wife who has chosen to stay at home 
 and there's , uh , has been a tendency over the past few years to treat her as though she was somebody who didn't have much intelligence 
and you're going to learn there is a lot of responsibility just keeping the home going .
and i hope we reach the point where whatever women chose to do , that's acceptable . 
if they chose to go into the work force that's okay . 
if they chose not to , that's acceptable . 
and if they go into the work force , they should be treated as nicely 
as equals . 
and , uh , not , 
so what do you think of the giants ? 
uh , i like the giants . 
they got , uh , 
i probably didn't get into baseball until maybe three years ago really 
 so , uh , but i just like the giants . 
i don't know why . 
i really got into them . 
i read , uh , dave dreveki's book 
oh , yeah . 
wasn't that something of him . 
that's really a , 
really proud of him though , the way he's , you know . 
the way he handled that entire situation , there . 
really , you know . 
but , i just think the giants have a good team . 
they got all , you know , 
they're real balanced out . 
they got real good pitching , 
and they got the hitting to go along with it . 
i just don't understand why they're not right up there on the top 
they just 
i don't really know what it is , 
that's really good seems , 
you know , like the a s they just had it all that one year . 
um i was mostly an a s fan , you know . 
i had been to more games at the a s than i have in the giants 
but , uh , i still like the giants , though , you know .
if you're a fan you got to stay with the team any way , you know , 
but . it's kind of hard . 
i still , basically , the , 
me and all my friends around here , since we don't have anywhere , 
i mean , we can go to the astros or the rangers teams , 
but since , no , 
really like either one of those teams , 
so we , uh 
about the most baseball we get is either t v or we play it on nintendo . 
we play r b i baseball on nintendo 
well , i prefer uh , football 
so do i , 
but baseball is still 
you got to do something when football ain't on . 
so  , 
so , hot dogs , baseball and apple pie . huh . 
this is america , 
so what do you think is going to happen this year to the teams ? 
uh , i don't know , it's hard to say . 
i haven't really , 
you have to just keep up with everything in the off season . 
it's kind of hard to do , 
at least , you know , 
i know . 
but , like i say , if they can get that one element that they were missing , i think the giants can do it . 
 well , the giants are . 
they just , 
i don't , 
i don't really know about the a s . 
they kind of . 
makes you sick , doesn't it ? 
you hear what he did . 
he ramming his wife's car , 
and i was like , yeah . 
he's like a little bitty kid , huh . 
he's just a little boy with a lot of money . 
that's just , 
you know , but . 
well , i guess the giants might move away from san francisco , it sounds like . 
i've heard talk about that . 
you know , uh , they won't be that far away , 
but san francisco will be hurting , anyhow . 
they're not going to be happy about it . 
you know . 
but i hope they can do good . 
i mean , that's just , 
i think they're a good team . that just need that one little thing to push them over . 
i don't know exactly what it is . 
they got , 
they're pretty balanced out all the way through . 
it just might be the drive , you know 
they probably just need something to push them 
or somebody basically , 
maybe they just need everybody to tell them they can't do it . 
maybe you know , that's what some teams need . 
look at the twins going from worst to first . 
i know , isn't that something 
i couldn't believe that , huh . 
so , he had his year this year , 
i just , it . 
we got into that a whole bunch . 
that was a series to remember , for sure . 
so i saw all seven games of that , 
i couldn't believe that , you know . 
i don't , uh , 
there was braves in that chanting that they had . 
that would drive you up a wall . 
every team with the indians been doing that now . 
 you know . 
i can't figure out why . 
you have to figure out why they're all doing that , i'm like , it's doesn't work , it's obvious it doesn't work because you know 
well , you're right .
so , uh , why keep on doing something that didn't work , 
oh , really ? 
well , baseball's baseball . 
it's kind of , 
uh , i'm not familiar . 
i think , uh , you guys in indiana , don't you have the death penalty ? 
it's not exercised very often , 
but we do have it . 
i believe it , 
i know there's a lot of problems with it , 
but , uh 
but , i know there's a lot of problems with that , like , well , they say , okay , if you put them on death row and execute them , well , then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it , then that life was wasted , 
uh , i tend to agree with you , 
uh , i've changed my views even within the last few years , uh , to be honest . 
uh , uh , when i was an undergraduate , i was a member of amnesty international 
 uh , and , of course , at that time , you know , i thought , uh , uh , it was stupid to kill anybody for , uh , 
you know , that 
the eye for an eye was a stupid argument . 
but the , uh , the more , 
now i live in downtown dallas , 
and uh , 
maybe , uh , a good solution to capital punishment might be , uh , reserve it solely for , uh , repeat offenders of a crime like , uh , murder . 
that's a thought that i had never really had on that 
uh , i don't , 
you know , not completely failsafe , 
but if a man's convicted of two murders , uh , you know , there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong . 
uh i also , uh , 
to tell you how liberal i have turned , uh , toward this , or whatever side that is 
and i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people , because , uh , really any kind of , uh , uh , jail sentence for them is just another chance to , uh , create another power structure .
you're right there . 
uh , i gue , 
basically my views , i guess they tend to be more economically oriented 
i mean , i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with 
 so to me i'm paying taxes , you know , twenty percent of my check or whatever 
so i'm all in favor of it . 
well , uh , do you , uh , 
are there cases where you think the capital punishment shouldn't be , uh , uh , sentenced ? 
well , i really don't know on that question . 
it just seems like , 
for instance , the jeffrey dahlmer case . i mean , i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society . 
i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets 
 and in that case , wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty , 
so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment 
 and i think that he should not be allowed to live , 
but , you know , then you're kind of playing god 
that's true , 
but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld , uh , not really that i can think of . 
 uh , i don't really agree with the , uh , death penalty for people like noriega and such as that . 
i think that they're operating on a more , 
i mean , i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here , 
but i don't really think it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live , because 
i understand your point . 
uh , of course , you know , i think it's ohio , uh , gets to try him next 
 so , uh , that was a curious case . 
uh , uh , something is sort of nightmarish 
that's right . 
uh , well , here in texas we , uh , 
i think last week they had another , they , uh , 
you know , they use their capital punishment by lethal injection , uh , uh , 
steve , this is , 
uh , do you have any experience in , uh , finding child care ? 
our kids are now fourteen and eighteen . 
uh , and so , you know , you go back those many years and , uh , we didn't do it very much . 
i guess , we were in a situation where we didn't need to be looking at , uh , two family income at the time .
and our kids were older . 
but i've had to deal with , uh , you know , friends of ours that have used child care and that kind of thing . 
uh , so it , 
my involvement hasn't been direct 
but still have been , you know , certainly exposed to criteria people are using . 
how about yourself ? 
well , uh , we're kind of lucky . 
uh , i'm working . 
my wife isn't working 
and she is taking care of the kids also . 
and so we haven't had to look for child care either which has been very nice . 
but i do have , like you mentioned , a lot of friends , a lot of , uh , coworkers and associates that are looking for child care 
and some of the things that they're very critical about is the number of kids that are in the child care . uh , what kind of , you know , uh , guidance counselor to student or , you know , uh , adult to child relationship . 
how many 
 you know , you don't want to have thirty or forty kids and only one adult . 
 right  .
and , uh , they also want to make sure that the kids are being taught and not just playing around all the time . 
so , you know , depends also upon the level of the child . 
we , uh , we , uh , take a very close look at finding a good preschool for our kid . 
and i kind of relate that to that the , uh , teachers are very well educated themselves . they have a good curriculum and that they're willing to teach the kids and have a fun time with them . 
and it's very important , i feel , uh , that the kids interact with other children also . 
it's a good way to develop 
so . i don't know . i guess we're kind of in the same boat . 
we haven't had to look very carefully for child care . 
i kind of think that , uh , you know , some of our friends or even our own children will be in a situation where they may need to look for child care . 
but even , you know , here . i guess we have of , uh , child care . 
there's where individuals will in one , primarily babysit 
and that will be groups of anywhere from one or two to , maybe , seven or eight children . 
and then otherwise , there will be 
 , the majority are cooperative daycares . 
uh , people form a coop and , uh , parents will work in the coop and put a fair number of hours . 
frequently , they will hire staff to be at the daycare 
and the emphasis is primarily , uh , someplace for the children to be . 
but , at the same time , there's some fairly good training programs and some of them formal two year programs . 
uh , so that , 
you know , there is some definite , uh , creative play , good social interaction , that kind of thing . 
i think it's , uh , important . like you mentioned , that's a good idea on the , uh , parent coop because , uh , i'm very concerned about the welfare of my kids 
and i don't want to just take them to somebody i pick out of the yellow pages or out of some ad somewhere . 
i want to trust the people .
and , uh , you know , of people that , you know , don't treat or take care of your kids the way you think they ought to be taken care of , 
have to find somebody and we have to trust someone with the welfare of our children . 
and hope that we can stay in this situation for awhile . 
you know , we've even had some of those kinds of situations publicized here 
 and i guess , you know , it , are , 
it's , uh , typically , uh , whether it's been child care in a home 
and you've actually got children that most people would consider problem children 
and it's more of a group home rather than 
 that's true , 
well , steven , it's been , 
well , i'm , 
i'm sure that i probably , uh , prescribe to different magazines ones that you do .
different set .
uh , i also take better homes and gardens . 
i like that . 
and then , uh , my husband , he just , uh , subscribed to a wood , 
he just started a woodwork 
so he just sent away to get some woodworking books . 
 so what kind do you , uh , get ? 
well i have a bunch of computer journals 
but beyond that , uh , lately i've been reading , 
i've always liked the new yorker . 
is it , 
i used to take that . 
and she still likes to get time 
but she seems to . 
i don't , 
you know , if i happen to find it , i'll go ahead and read it someplace , you know , if i'm in a doctor's office or something like that 
but other than that i never liked that really . 
do you read a newspaper ? 
i can hardly wait in the mornings for the newspaper 
in fact , it puts it out on tuesdays and thursdays .
i haven't bought it now for about eight years . 
but when i used to get it , it was about five hundred pages , about three hundred of them advertising . 
that half the fun is finding out what all the products are . 
but , you know , some of the get ridiculous . 
travel and leisure , all of the american express magazines 
 so travel and leisure , food and wine and i think they have some others , uh , certainly half the pages and maybe more are pure ads plus they have the advertising supplement sections that are supposed to look like articles but are paid for 
and they don't care if they make any money on the magazine subscription , they're making everything on ads . 
well i only , you know , subscribe to the things i'm interested in . 
i used to be into coin collecting 
so i used to get the coin magazine , the paper actually is what it was , you know . 
i used to get that . 
so now that i'm into dolls , that's about 
have you ever , uh , read or subscribe to consumer reports for any length of time ? 
but not worth it . 
i've always had this , 
one of the reasons i like just to pick up magazines in other fields is that you seem to get a very different perspective . 
so i've always had this problem with consumer reports that in the areas that i know a lot about , i disagree with them . 
and i always wonder whether there are people who know a lot about every area disagreeing with them on everything ,
so like i've picked up now a subscription to one of the travel agent , uh , organization magazines 
and it's a ridiculous difference when you start reading from their perspective . 
uh , you know , their major interest is in commissions 
and , you know , there's very little talk about the quality of places or airlines . 
their major talk is about , you know , commissions and commission rebates and how they won't suggest hotels to people if the commission's not the full ten percent or whatever it is 
well those travel magazines , more or less , show you different countries that you could go to 
the general travel magazines do . 
but on domestic stuff . 
well i don't know any other magazines i could talk to you about . 
uh , i don't take anymore than that .
i don't take much more in myself . 
you know , so . 
nice talking to you . 
uh , based , 
oh , okay . 
 uh , let me see . 
i'm kind of , 
i don't , 
you know , i'm , i'm kind of in the middle . 
i think it's a great idea 
 but when it comes to me , it's like , almost an insult , you know , 
i've come from the teaching field . 
so do i .
i guess i'd have to go with , uh , 
but for going ahead and doing it , you know . if it's got to be done for everyone . 
i think if it's got to be done for one person in the company , it should be random testing , it should be for everybody . 
you know , when they answer the company , i think it'll make it a lot easier 
i don't know , i come from the teaching field too 
and it sort of , uh , 
it's a pro and a con ty , 
i don't know where to stand on it . 
i'm more or less , if they told me i had to well then fine , 
if i had my druthers i'd probably say well no 
 you know just this , 
you kind of goes into your privacy 
you know , you know , there's , uh , 
i guess there's some companies that are doing it . 
and it seems to be working out 
and , uh , anybody who , uh , gee , is , you know , doesn't accept the rehab program then they're , more or less , getting laid off . 
that's a , 
it's really weird issue . 
i'm sort of 
but i , 
you know , that's what's they're coming across as  is  some of the companies anyhow . 
oh , we can get you into a drug program . 
but then you wear that stigma 
then i kind of hear it goes into like , uh , 
anything with a , 
you know , if you drink a lot of caffeine or , 
 oh , i didn't know that . 
somebody was telling me if you drink it in ,
i know i'm an epileptic 
so i'd probably test positive 
see things like that 
and a lot of times , those are the things i don't like to disclose to an employer because then they don't want to have anything to do with you .
you know , it's very personal . 
i wouldn't want to have it disclosed because 
see that's , 
that's where i kind of get into , 
cause it kind of gets into your personal life , you know . 
and i sh , 
i'd hate to have to , 
if i had my choice between a company that did testing and a company who didn't 
but i can understand why they need it with all the , you know , train accidents and everything else . 
so do you think they'll kind of push into the teaching field eventually ? 
i don't know . we haven't had any of it in our school system . 
 so , uh , you know 
we haven't either . 
but i just kind of think it's heading that way though , you know . it's just , because it's just hitting to close to home with the kids and stuff 
and i just 
well and eventually it's going to be not only the tea , 
you know , the kids are 
and if they can test the teachers , that gives them the full right to test the kids . 
and then they , you know , caught everybody . 
uh , i haven't been in this situation yet .
you know , my parents are not quite at that age yet , 
 so i haven't , 
how about you ? 
have you been in that situation yet ? 
but i was around , uh , two sets of grandparents , uh , quite a bit , 
i put one grandfather in a rest home 
 and that killed him .
did it really ? 
well , yeah , 
well , there was some other things involved 
but it , 
before he was really active 
and the , 
there was some , 
you know , he lost his drivers license 
and  i  couldn't get around and wasn't able to do some things 
and so we ended up just having to put him in a rest home . 
and he just kind of became a vegetable and died . 
that was , uh , back in like seventythree . 
oh , okay . 
 so , uh , i think the way they did things were a lot different back then . 
i'm sure they were . 
 and , uh , my grandmother , his wife 
she was in a rest home 
and then she was back out because she didn't really need to be there and , uh , physical , had a good physical therapist at that place 
and so 
but mostly it was just because she kind of gave up . 
and they got her going again . 
so i guess as far as looking , 
 and i'm sure it's expensive .
it is .
my grandmother is not in a nursing home 
but she's in a 
 oh uh , they're apartments for senior citizens 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and she loves that because they arrange activities for them all day long 
 and then they have , uh , where the bus picks them up and takes them where they need to go 
and she really does love that 
when she can't take care of herself . 
and i , 
you know , i guess it's so normal to start to wonder about that even if she doesn't need that , 
now  , 
and so . 
does she have a , 
is it like a kitchenette type apartment where she can fix her own food if she wants to 
 or she can go down to the cafeteria ? 
 in fact , i   , 
because in her letters , telling me she'll go downstairs for coffee or something to eat , 
so i'm assuming it's something like that too . 
i really like that concept . 
well quite a few of those places like that here in utah 
and , you know , couples can , 
you know , husband and wife or whatever . 
their friendships and relationships and the , you know , of getting together and eating together and all of that . 
i think it really takes , uh , you know , looking more at the people than even really the facilities . 
and she lives by herself too . 
she seems to like it . 
and , uh , my husband's grandmother is , 
well , she lives in a house on her own 
and she doesn't really need the care or anything like that 
but , she has her own home 
and she's doing really well . 
i'm really proud of her . 
so we haven't had to do anything , 
but then again , she has a lot of support 
well , it's almost like 
that , you know , they say putting them out to pasture 
and some of the people that were there with my grandmother were really active . 
they wanted to do things . 
you know , they didn't want to go down and play bingo or , uh , you know , play with the oranges  ,
central america , have you ever lived in central america . 
and i did live in , uh ,  san polo  brazil for four years . 
that we should have given up the panama canal ? 
uh , realistically , i , 
and , uh , maybe it would be better that we let the panamanians run it however , i think , we're certainly justified in , uh , our actions dealing with , uh , noriega in this  . . . 
well , there are those that the panama canal has some considerable strategic importance , particularly for the military . 
interestingly enough my father and , uh , help with the defenses of the panama canal . 
he had worked for united fruit company there , 
and in fact , they had , 
this was in the late twenties 
and they in fact used some of the equipment that had been left over 
and , uh , he turned them down . 
that most people don't realize how small the canal is . 
have you ever been there ? 
it's really , 
i haven't been there , 
i've been to , been to salvador 
of my fathers , that we went in fiftyseven i guess . 
and interestingly enough the canal is quite small and , and realistically could be sabotaged quite easily . 
the thing i find interesting , though , uh , is the whole colonial approach 
or do we support , uh , 
you know , uh , they thought that nicaragua , if you gave them a free election , they would vote for the , 
will you , uh , 
did you ever studied in nicaragua . 
but , uh , certainly , uh , there , 
you've got this toss up betw , 
or its own people . 
and now 
but that 
on the other hand we believe in self preservation and , uh , we used to see spheres 
but now we're in a situation where the united states looks like we're it now . 
well the interesting part about it is that , if , realistically it was economic . 
i don't know if you read any of the history on where the panama canal 
but there was an option to build it across nicaragua , 
uh , and , uh , there's a big lake , 
and , um , from a technical standpoint it wouldn't have been a lot more difficult to have built it in nicaragua , 
but the united states , uh , had some , 
and i've forgotten what the political influence was 
but there were economic ties then . 
the issue of 
and prevail 
and , uh , in other words do we make the world safe for democracy , 
but if there's no economic benefit , 
and i think particularly uh , or democratic government . 
you look at salvador where the , 
well he doesn't care as long as he's feeding uh , his family . 
and the question is , does the government make a difference . 
if they'll mostly leave him alone , uh , 
and i think that's the difficulty uh , doesn't make any difference if he has no income . 
and apparently even some of our alleged , uh , central american leaders that , uh , are mostly democratic have done some pretty terrible things , 
so it's , uh , 
well , yo , 
in looking , bu , 
if you look at the region in , uh , 
to their detriment they came from , uh , this , uh , hundreds of years of spanish control 
their own good . 
i mean , if you go back to the kings uh , the native tribes , 
i mean uh , they make the things that custer did look like , uh , like trivial . 
and , uh , you get , 
we look at the exploitation 
and then we accuse some other people of exploiting them 
uh , have a pretty good reputation of exploiting , 
you know and took it . 
oh , absolutely 
and , you know we set up  . . . 
and we stole it fair and square , 
i mean , uh , for nothing 
and , uh , 
what's america's role there 
and it , uh , 
it seems to have lessened , 
but you've still got , uh , cuba that exerts some influence . 
the only thing i see about cuba though , is , uh , after fidel castro dies , i don't think they'll be a communist power anymore . 
i can't see communism in that country carrying on past him . 
well , when you take a situation where i think in particular in salvador where there is a significant under class  , excuse me , 
and that , uh , 
you know , having you know , would they be better off under communism . 
and i don't know that i would advocate communism 
but , uh , the question is uh , can a democracy , uh , afford the , 
it's like the street people that are starting to show up all other the u s , 
and when you get enough of them , uh , you know communism would feed them all . 
but what we would , 
there would have to be some kind of , 
to deal with the problem and then be able to gradually transform back to a democracy . 
well that , 
if the guys got some incentive , 
if he's got , uh , 
you know , if he can raise enough , uh , coffee and bananas to , uh , where he's got something to protect , 
other , you know , 
whether he can export or at least , uh , set up trade and all then democracy of a considerable interest . 
but cocoa leaves sell real well right now , it seems , 
as well as some other various things that are growing in tropical environments . 
i don't , 
it's going to be hard to , um , 
if you , 
to make him growing bananas profitable again , i mean . 
to grow something in your backyard , would you do it . 
well not that we could be bought , 
but , uh , 
i've got to watch what i say here , 
i never know when the d i a may be , uh , listening on my phone .
and  . . . 
of course , 
it's tempting , 
those peasants . 
particularly , if you're hungry . 
of feeding themselves their wife and their family 
and you , 
there's a certain degree of honor in being able to feed your family 
and there's dishonor in not being able to do it 
and  . . . 
uh , starving to death is not a whole lot of fun either 
and , that , 
in reality , i think , what they were doing is basically going in and trying to feed some people and help them protect themselves , 
not that they , 
is particularly political 
but , you know , if  . . . 
i was a resident , although very young of what is now the state of alaska in nineteen fiftynine when alaska stopped being a territory and became a state . 
uh , so i guess i have a left over positive feeling about the question even though i don't know very much about puerto rico . 
uh , i know that all the things that happened , relative to that territory in alaska have been very positive , uh , 
and i have a suspicion or let it go , one or the other . 
what is your situation ? 
well , with , um , an area becoming a state as you do . 
um , my concern is the economy because as i understand it puerto rico has a very low uh , standard of living or at least , um , annual average income . 
um , part of this i suppose is justified in that the climate they don't need , perhaps , the heating and the housing that some of the more northern territories need . 
however , in that case , i guess i would favor status quo . 
i have been to puerto rico and found it very , very interesting . 
i did peace corps training there . 
oh that's very interesting . 
and so , um , you know , i saw it , also as a young student 
and it was very foreign in a certain sense , although i had grown up in california 
and so the spanish was no problem . 
um , it was , you know , very lovely 
and nice . 
i have , 
actually , i work with , uh , a girl from puerto rico 
and , i guess i have never thought to ask her what she favors , um . 
well probably more in terms of the u . s . um , 
you know , i'm not quite sure how the u . s . copes with this sort of thing . 
i've live abroad most of my life , 
so , i guess i've been very cut off . 
i lived actually in lebanon , 
so , i was very cut off from was becoming an adult . 
so , i don't know how the u . s . would cope with , uh , a new state that is so very , very poor . 
um , i guess , you know , we'd have a lot of aid , and how much aid it needs . 
i suppose or the whole , um , new state would require such aid . 
i guess , um , we're assuming than say mississippi 
that's something than puerto rico as a tropical island and consequently large numbers of barefoot natives or something not in a  perjuritive  sense but in a , in a carefree sense , i guess . 
although i'm aware of the political problems and unrest , statehood would improve their economy . 
on them . 
uh , i guess they would have the ability to do some taxing that they don't have now . 
but of course if their economy is weak there is not much of a base on which to tax . 
i don't know if they suffer in a sense of income loss as being , since they aren't a state , whether there are monies that escape them so to speak because they aren't able to tax like a typical state would be . 
how do you feel , though , about , 
well i guess it's to their advantage to be a territory , 
but , um , i wonder how having been in a territory but only as a young student 
and my parents were in the military at the time 
so they didn't have ready negative feelings about being in alaska at the time since they voted absentee . 
feeling of second class citizenry , uh , to be in a territory that large and not being able to vote . 
the district of columbia people , for instance are quite frustrated , i think , at times in their not having a senate representative . 
those , are good points , um , which obviously i had never thought about . 
uh , i don't know , uh , i suppose they also , not being a state are probably freer to determine their own , um , ways of life than they would if , 
i'm trying to think exactly what is imposed if they would become a state versus a territory . 
uh , i see what you mean , 
so that , 
taxes would undoubtedly be occurring . 
uh , there , 
i don't know , i don't even understand exactly how taxes are handled in a territorial situation . 
um , frequently the laws in a territory are in some ways as stringent as they are in other states , 
and i'm thinking in terms of education . 
but then again each state sets its own 
and i don't know how a territorial governor takes care of something like puerto rico . 
um , it's interesting because i haven't thought of them in terms of the problems relative to , uh , economy , uh , i had thought of it more in terms of political , uh , realization 
and i guess i had automatically made the assumption that , gee , anyone would rather be a state of the u . s . than an independent country 
well , well actually i thin , 
one , one thing that i remember hearing in the news the past couple weeks that might be significant is that they've recently voted that spanish is the official language , which i always assumed it was anyway . 
so , if they've just taken such action , it would seem to indicate to me either they're doing it because they're afraid they might become a state and want to declare this before they become a state , or maybe because they don't want to become a state for fear of losing the spanish , or hispanic heritage . 
well that's interesting too . 
well it sounds as though you are in favor of , uh , status quo . 
and i think , uh , having listened to you relative to the economy thing , i think if i were being forced to make a decision i would plead ignorance and wait to do more research before picking one of these . 
so i'm ul , i guess i'm ultimately in favor of status quo also at this point ,
well that's interesting . 
what about if , um , they demanded to have spanish as the official language as a condition for statehood . 
i think i would be troubled , 
i believe that any of our states , 
and i , 
constitutionally i don't think there are any prescriptions against that decision even if louisiana chose to go with creole or something . 
um , i don't think there is any prohibitions . 
i would be bothered by that . 
i'm bothered by any tendency to resist what i think was one of america's strengths 
and that's the melting pot . 
uh , i am particularly fond of a number of ethnic cuisines , 
but i'm troubled by too close a clinging to the past 
and i'm also realizing that a common language , i think , is the ultimate bond of a country . 
and canada , i guess , comes to my mind as they're going through the throes up there relative to french quebec and whatever . 
uh , that i think that would be a negative step to make 
and i think that that they would need to reassess that . 
um , i'm troubled even in by bilingualism , uh , in so far that of the melting pot aspect . 
that's interesting because although i tend to be bilingual , spanish based on experience , um , i was in bilingual education in california 
and i didn't have any problem with my students
but i noticed my brother , who was quite a bit younger , was learning spanish in elementary school 
and he can't speak a word . 
and so , obviously it didn't work in california . 
but i'm rather in favor of people being bilingual , 
and i'd be quite happy to see a national law in which every student was required to learn english and a second language . 
but i'm disturbed by a country that attempts to be functionally bilingual at the official level . 
oh , i see . 
um , i'm concerned about whether or not that causes fractiousness i guess . 
and i appreciate your having called . 
well thank you very much . 
so what are your opinions on it ? 
well , let me preface it . 
i'm a , 
i was a staff officer in vietnam , in sixtynine and seventy 
 and i'm in active reserve now , 
so , uh , i'm probably not going to have the   you think i would have . 
uh , it's , 
uh , i , 
are you old enough to remember the war ? 
i'm twentyeight , 
so . no . 
i really don't remember anything about it . 
i guess i was about ten when it ended . 
i was born in sixtytwo , 
so when did it end ? 
well , december seventytwo , was when we bombed north vietnam , and then they released the prisoners in early seventythree ,
because , i was ten , 
and i don't remember a lot about anything at that time in my life very much in ,
i think ,
but i did read the book . 
i ha , 
do ha , 
i have six years of college , 
so i did read , and study about the vietnam war though . 
so i am pretty fa , 
you know , i'm more , 
well , what's 
familiar with it than , 
uh , i think that there was a lot of rebellion in our nation , and that , i think it was the right thing to do , to try and not to take away , to , you know ,  just leave their freedoms there  and to , you know , get rid of some of the atrocities that were going to .
i don't know , i don't really , 
see on the other hand , i'm a pac , 
i'm really struggling with it . 
and i believe that the real warfare is not with saddam hussein , or the north vietnamese , 
but it's in spiritual kingdoms , and that the real warfare is done , you know , in your prayer closet , on your knees . 
so , in a way , in a sense i'm a pacifist , 
i don't think just lay back and not do anything . 
but let's go to war praying , 
and let's go to war for that way 
well , well , the difficulty i have , is that , uh , are we our neighbor's keepers . 
the difficult , is to , where do we step in , 
still have a problem with , uh , 
you know , i haven't come to an absolute conclusion on my opinion on this , 
and i know other christians would disagree with me . 
my husband and i , are kind of not even in agreement on this , 
but we don't fight over it or anything , 
but , you know , how can , 
so it's like how can you , 
i don't know , for me , 
i don't know , you know , i can't say that i agree with vietnam , because how can you be gentle unto all men , and then shoot them . 
could you stand there and watch them beat that guy . 
if your brother or your sister were being beaten ,
and i think that's what makes it so difficult . 
it is a difficult thing . 
and i will pay . 
so , i think god is ultimately in charge of what goes on , 
and they were terrible , 
and he was going to be accountable for them ,
he unified the chinese language . 
it was impossible for missionaries to accomplish anything in china 
and so even in north and south vietnam , i bet you'd see the same thing , and that now he builds roads 
so , then it 
  and then he dropped dead , twentyfive years premature , he dropped dead , 
and so something good did come out of that , in that now , you see what i mean , if like now , 
to feed my sheep 
and the idea , do we go out and feed these people when they're hungry . 
well . bless your enemies , if your enemy is hungry , feed him , 
asks for your shirt , give him your coat also . 
so , if the , 
is that right ? 
 and the question is , who was he going to pay it to ? 
uh , the communists are all alleged democrats . uh , 
democratic formed government , 
and difficult part , there , 
and , i , 
we didn't understand the culture . 
we couldn't , uh , 
in the unit i was commander of , that appeared to be eight or nine years old , 
and the people looked like children 
 i mean , you couldn't imagine that one 
i think socially , it really destroyed a lot of the people that went over and saw these people . 
you just couldn't believe and drop bombs and kill people , 
and then 
 and i think there was a lot of tearing of emotions , 
and i think that if anything , that , when   he was saying the idea that we learned , we learned a lot from vietnam 
 now , it was in general , bad , 
and , i don't know , the problem is now , 
i'm concerned a little bit ,
i think it was a good war , 
and it was okay 
and a little more justice at home . 
i'm not sure how we get that , 
wonder if there's a connection there , 
but    , 
but then again , yeah , 
i'd say it is wrong to   
and i'm not saying president bush made the wrong decision . 
i think i'm lacking in my , 
i don't think i can come to a complete conclusion on how i feel about the vietnam war , because i'm going to interpret that , through the bible , 
and i've kind of always , 
i've been a christian five years , 
and i've kind of avoided you know , need to decide ,
well , the difficulty is 
you know , and you , 
i think that's one of those things when we get to heaven we're going to ask god .
i know . 
why did you do it that way .
but then again , though  jesus  the grace pushes you beyond the law , you know what i'm saying , 
but , not only don't kill them , bless them . 
what can we do to rectify this situation , 
and that god would move in that sovereignly , 
and he would get the glory , though , no king , no , 
bush wouldn't , because it wouldn't make any sense , you know what are i'm saying ? 
it would look absolutely , ridiculously stupid , 
but the thing is that then god gets the glory , not a president , not a king , 
and i think that's a problem for a lot of politicians , is they want the glory . 
well , and , i , 
and even at the local level , when somebody's assaulted 
well , i believe , personally , 
i ho , 
i   woman always says , my husband always goes three that , i guess . 
to take authority over that , 
and i know people that have done that . 
i mean , i know that there have been people who have had people break in their homes , and just say i bind you in jesus name , 
i just , 
and rebuke any enemy , because i believe it's a spiritual war that's going on , 
and it's not normal for someone to come into someone elses home , 
there's something going on there , and that i would have discernment by the holy spirit to deal with pride over that . 
do you see what i mean ? 
but , i have a problem with all the killing , 
but i'm not a new ager , i don't believe 
  i am not for one world government . 
i'm not for all these new age things . 
you know , i don't have a problem with , uh , national identity , 
and , i'm an american , 
and having different nations , and all of this . 
but , i'm concerned about the killing that went on there , because i just feel like god has a better way to handle it , than that , 
and  . . . 
um , so , um , do you have any favorite teams ? 
i played for about eighteen years , all the way through college , and then , uh , kind of hung them up after college , 
oh , i was going to say , you played pro ball , 
not quite , huh . 
made it , 
made it all the way through four years of college playing ball , 
i'm one of these people who's actually a die hard mets fan ,
um , more people , 
you know , real met fans don't like the yankees 
and real yankee fans don't like the mets for some reason . 
i never quite found a new york fan . 
i always found a fan , you know , of either one or the other , 
and so , that of course means that when it comes to the american league my favorite team is the red sox 
oh , okay , 
i see , 
i like the , uh , 
huh , i guess if i had to pick a favorite team , any more , as well as , 
i kind of grew up rooting for philadelphia . 
i'm from new jersey originally . 
so that's sort of close enough . 
well , we were thirty miles south of them , 
oh , so you were pretty close . 
but , uh , so what are the mets going to do this year without strawberry ? 
well , i don't know . um , there's a part of me that says that , you know , um , i'm sort of glad strawberry went away . 
you know , when he sort of went away , i started thinking , yeah , well , he was performing fairly well , 
but he really wasn't worth the baggage , you know . 
um , i think they're okay , 
i think they're , 
you know , i think they have enough people who are still in their prime , you know . 
um , i mean , certainly if you look at them compared to , let's say , you know , um , eight years ago or something , 
well , i was going to talk to you about that eightysix team .
that was the year they beat houston in extra innings , 
and then they actually won the series byebye sort of a sneaky route , um , against boston 
i felt real bad about that , 
but hey , what can you do . 
hey , the guy's making millions , 
he ought to be able to perform , 
there was something wrong with him at the time , 
and i , 
well , his knees were bothering him , 
and i understand that , 
and i say , hey if the guy can't play , you don't blame that , 
uh , hit it to him , 
you blame the team , you know , for putting him in , 
for having him out there . 
that's right , 
so , i was in school at boston at the time . 
oh , boy . 
so , i , 
it was actually wonderful because where i was they were half met fans and , um , half sox fans . 
i think we were all pretty much , uh , astros fans , in the national league championship series 
 but there's like two fellows from , uh , brooklyn , 
and you know , they were pretty much without having to say , they were pretty much mets fans .
well uh , i guess they must have been scared after the , uh , 
they were pretty much thugs , 
they weren't scared very much , you know .
well , that's good , 
well , they're brooklyn boys , i guess . 
you don't expect them to be , uh , much of anything but thugs . 
i was also born in brooklyn , 
so i can call myself a brooklyn thug , although i'm really not . 
well , i'm not to say that all folks from brooklyn are thugs , 
these two were definitely thugs , 
and they were from brooklyn .
so i'm kind of hoping , 
i guess , uh , any more 
i pretty much pull for the rangers though . 
i think they have the best facilities in the major leagues . 
i love going to watch a game in arlington stadium . 
it's great . 
 well , that's 
actually , i think i make something , because i think , 
and in as much as sort of fan support helps . 
you know , it's good to have , um , 
the only problem is it's not large enough . 
it only holds about , 
i think they , when ryan struck out his five thousandth player , they squeezed about forty thousand people in there . 
it is kind of small . 
so they have plans , 
i mean , the owner tried to move them to florida 
 but , uh , they ended up sticking around in arlington , 
and they're going to build a new stadium in arlington , as a matter of fact , not even in dallas , 
oh , that's great . 
so that's something that we're looking forward to . 
that'll be nice , 
i mean , that , i think , tends to keep , 
i think stadiums   work tend to keep people happy . 
oh , case in point , toronto . 
have you seen a game up there ? 
but , um , 
oh , boy , i saw it , i was up there on business , uh , last june and watched a game in the sky dome . 
it was just phenomenal . 
that's probably the pattern for the future of stadiums , i think . 
well , i mean to get up there . 
i mean , in up state new york 
now is rochester , 
where is cornell university . 
oh , cornell is in ithaca . 
ithaca . 
uh , yeah , 
so cornell is about , um , somewhere , uh , about two and a half hours south and east of us . 
so if you know where lake ontario is sort of . 
actually whoever built the city was an idiot , in my opinion ,
um , but they , 
oh , really , i hadn't actually known that . 
well , um , but we have um , our own triple a team here 
the redwings , 
so everybody hopes that , uh , they go all the way around here . 
there's the , 
they're the big team in rochester . 
those games are fun to watch . 
you watch those games ? 
oh , yeah , 
actually , we make a point of going to a bunch of them every year because they're fun . 
lots of really big , 
you know , lots of local fans , you know , small stadium , you know , um , 
and they'll get a crowd of less than ten thousand sometimes , you know 
you know , i'll make a day game or something . 
but they really seem to , uh , 
people really get into it . 
i mean , again , i can't make any predictions about them , 
we used to like watching , 
my folks lived down in beaumont , 
and , uh , on the campus of lamar university they used to house the beaumont golden gators who were a double a team for the padres , i think , 
but , uh , they were fun games to watch . 
uh , i think those are more fun than major league games sometimes . 
well , there's definitely a lot more hitting .
it's true . 
one of the advantages of not having pitchers who are 
 uh , uh , you know , i guess when you start pitching real well , well , move them up . bam   .
but um . 
so as far as the major league teams , i don't know , the rangers have been , 
you know , every year they always knock on the door early , and then just go into their skid about , you know , the end of june . 
but they've got so much young , raw talent , 
it's just amazing , 
and then they just haven't been able to put anything together . 
well , the way i see it , is , 
i mean , um , you know , i can use a met analogy here . 
if you'll think back a few years to when the mets were just all this sort of young bunch of guys who really were raw talent but weren't very sort of , well trained 
 you know , back to , you know , maybe eighty , eightyfour or eightythree 
that probably gives the readers a good shot for you this year or next year , the young talent really just has to build itself up . 
i mean , they've been young for a while , 
and they're almost starting to age a little bit here , 
i just , um . 
they really hurting pitching wise . 
i mean , they've got ryan , 
but , you know , who knows what he'll be able to do . 
he's been , 
last year he started having some nagging injuries , 
i hope to get up there . 
we usually try to get to opening day game . 
there's several guys from our church try to go up there . 
oh , that must be nice . 
well , oh , maybe a hundred fifty miles south of dallas . 
but it takes about two hours , two and a half hours to get there . 
well it takes me a good seven hours to get to shay stadium . 
so , i don't know . 
that's probably because of the roads . 
you just don't have , 
we've just got a freeway . 
we just get right on the freeway and just go north . 
but it's some 
well , it's so crowded up there . 
i mean , i mean , it's almost four hundred , 
you know , barring traffic , it's four hundred hours , 
i mean , four hundred mil , 
four hundred hours , 
four hundred miles 
so , you know , it's a heck of a drive . 
we are substantially north of new york enough that , uh 
you're like a boat ride from , 
how far is it across the lake to canada ? 
oh toronto's only about two hours , 
toronto , i mean , i want to go see . 
do you drive there , 
or do you take the ferry , or what ? 
actually i've driven , 
but i've heard about the ferry as well . 
haven't taken it yet , though . 
have you taken it ? 
um , i really love , 
i think that's one of the most , uh , enjoyable things about being up here . 
i'm only up here for school . 
and then , i mean , you go back to new york after school ? 
uh , no , 
oh , really . 
some place south , and warm , 
i don't , 
uh , i'm not a big , uh , cold fan . 
well , what kind of weather are you having right now ? 
uh , right now we're actually having , uh , 
it's getting nice . 
i mean , it was in the high fifties today , 
but three and a half weeks ago , we had an ice storm .
oh , boy , 
we've been up in the , oh , seventies , eighties , even up in the nineties a couple of weeks ago . 
oh , that's great . 
you know , about that same time branches were falling off everywhere , 
and we were actually in a state of emergency for two weeks . 
because of the ice ? 
because it , didn't make the national news too much , which i find really weird 
 but , um , we were , i mean , um , 
you know , all schools were closed for a week . 
there were certain parts of town where it was illegal to drive . 
huh , illegal , 
because they had so many power lines down 
oh , yeah . 
 and so many , uh , things like that , 
so they were  . . . 
well is your , 
does your city have mandatory , uh , recycling ? 
actually , we're kind of slow up here , 
and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer . 
and it's all voluntary . 
so that's interesting . 
cities have a mandatory recycling ? 
that's been one of the arguments here . 
i'm just sitting here looking . we've got four bins of glass and plasticine stuff . 
but we have to carry it , uh , some distance , 
and some places , um , you can sell your , uh , recyclables , 
and , for example , our church was collecting newspapers . 
when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing . 
we got like a penny a pound for them . 
well , it turns out that so much , 
the problem in texas is that , uh , they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to , uh , reprocess it . 
oh , my , 
it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it , 
and so the value has gone down . 
it turns out it wasn't worth for the church to do . 
oh , i didn't realize , 
you would think , 
now up here , i suppose they send it all back to the mill 
and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of , uh . 
actually there is one in northern vermont . 
so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here . 
i didn't think that , 
you know , in the large city that if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away 
well see , that's , 
in dallas there no plan to build , 
i think there's some in east texas there's some pulp mills , 
but , uh , you have to go to houston , 
and , it's interesting , 
and then there's places that will buy metal 
and they still buy aluminum can and likes that . *[[can cans  ? likes like ?
do you have to buy metal , 
like copper is a very good one to collect . 
even aluminum , 
well , do you do recycling ? 
and our city will pick up our recyclables . 
they have these little blue bins . 
um , i don't recycle personally . 
i'm saying i want to do it , 
but , i don't get a lot of magazines , 
i don't get a , 
i don't buy the newspaper , 
but i do have a lot of , uh , 
my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of different papers and cardboards . 
well , do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans ? 
a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles . 
we've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years . 
oh , so it's worth taking them back . 
well , see , we don't have . 
we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles . 
oh , they should definitely get , um , the nickel returnable . 
it's great for the kids , because 
see , a lot of the kids get the money from it , 
and it's great for the boy scouts running around , they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes . 
oh , that's it , 
there is a down side to all this , you know , about no good deed going unpunished ,
and so every time i recycle newspapers , in fact there's a , uh , 
kimberly and clark , the makers of kleenex and such 
in fact i almost went to work for them . 
i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me . 
it's twenty or thirty miles from my house . 
every time you recycle , that's one less tree my mother can sell , 
and , uh . so , it's a question should i be diligent um , 
and recycle . 
oh , yes , 
i see that . 
but , it's an interesting point , though , that , you know , everybody's so anxious to recycle , 
and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment , 
but it takes away employment from the resource 
and its   .
well , but in general i think it's a good idea because 
i do , too . 
it doesn't biodegrade , and , uh , the plastics obviously , 
they don't either 
so we might as well recycle those . 
like i say , it's not a very controversial thing . 
everyone thinks we should do it . 
it's just that we're so lazy , 
i mean , like personally , i don't want to clean my , 
i just have can cat food . 
i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it , and put it in a separate bin . 
you know , i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash . 
well , that's what we've got . 
we started about , new year's we decided we'd get ambitious . 
well , we took one load over there , 
and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff , 
and , you know , it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there . 
i think i would be like , 
when i bring my bottles back . if they're pretty clean and stuff , so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months , 
and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them over . 
now , if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean , like if i washed all the cans and things , i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much , 
but if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it . 
but , um , i produce quite a bit of trash , 
my , you know , house , 
and i see it , 
but i don't see so much that i can recycle . 
like i say , it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard . 
i'm not a real plastic person user , but a lot of paper , um , pretty much , 
and i don't know how they sort that . 
but i would have a recycling center . 
but now , it's just me and my husband , 
so , i don't know . 
but every little bit helps , 
but we have a very aggressive recycling at work , 
and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin . 
see , some people , the recycle bin is on their way out . 
instead of carrying your newspapers , when they get done with them at the end of the day , they throw them in the trash . 
well , do you have separate trash cans at your desk . 
um , no , 
but other offices do . 
they have a box for papers . 
well , and then for uh , lunch sacks and waste food 
and they gave us a list of things that aren't re , 
and it turns out it's not so bad . 
like saran wrap or something , anyway , 
 and then , uh , cardboard , there's a few , 
it's interesting that we're recycling computer type paper . 
and , uh , one day they'll pick up , uh , 
the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper , 
and then the next day they'll pick up the other , 
depending on how much , 
you know , and there's a lot of , actually , it works pretty well , 
and then we have a , uh , waste , uh , cans for aluminum in the break areas at work . 
well , that's a really good idea , because , um , like our , uh , fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit . 
and they're thinking about putting a deposit on them , because you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans , where they're 
but when they sell juice , it's some strange quirk in the law , you don't have to have a deposit on it . 
and even like , a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it , 
but if it's got soda in it , it does . 
so , it's a strange . 
that's an interesting distinction . 
clear that up . 
it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the , uh , juice cans as easily as the soda . 
but redemption centers are a big thing up here , 
they get a penny a can they handle . 
they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor . 
i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can . 
well , see , well , see , those of us that don't have state income taxes , 
and , it's interesting what people get upset about , 
uh , it really is . 
is bottle return down there a heated debate ? 
well , no , 
oh , yeah . 
well , we , 
we're not civilized now , you cannot drink beer and drive , 
well , i know , i was in atlanta , 
and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand . 
so that was strange . 
but , i think , 
if some people they have , 
and , their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits 
and see if it's a good way , 
and then do it that way . because , like i say , people are making money on it . 
well , you know , the other , 
the cans are worth something . 
well , do you exercise regularly , judy ? 
 and i love to walk , 
so if i have a lunch hour with nice weather i get out and walk . 
what about you ? 
well , um , i , uh , exercise regularly . 
i work at a university , 
and i swim almost every day 
uh , very good . 
but washington is one of my favorite places to visit . 
uh , my daughter lives in arlington , 
and when i go to visit her , i love to get out on that bike trail , and either ride the bike , oh , 
gosh , you can ride a bike practically all the way to southern virginia 
but washington's a great place to do that . 
there are lots of bike paths . 
i know , my son is a biker 
and he's done the whole   canal , i think it's a hundred and eighty miles , with the scouts . 
but that somehow takes ,
for me , it's much easier just the stationary bike , 
you know , it's at home , i can do some of my reading , 
um , but , 
do you live in the district ? 
because i think there're so many parts of the district where it's not very safe to get out and walk . 
and that's it , um , 
at work we have a nice campus , 
i mean , we're within walking distance of stores and shops 
so i do . 
now , i think , um , 
well , uh , it's really both . 
i'm certainly driven by the desire to maintain my weight and be healthy and be in shape , 
uh , and most of the time i enjoy it . 
sometimes i don't , 
but i feel uh , that the discipline it affords me when i do it when i don't want to is also worth something . 
i think pretty much you summed up my motivations also . 
and i often find that even when i don't feel that much like exercising , 
like i'll be really tired , 
and i'll start swimming , 
and i'll actually get energy . 
and i'll have much more energy when i'm done than when i started , 
i mean , i just feel great . 
that happens to me probably one in four or five times that i swim . 
oh , well , that's great , 
and that's really a terrific feeling , because you just go there at the end of the day , and you figure , god , i'm ready for bed 
but by the time you get done you feeling really terrific . 
and actually in summer i like to swim . 
we don't have facilities for swimming in winter , 
and that's true , when i go home from work at the end of the day , if i go up for an hour in the pool , i'm much , much more awake , 
i'm ready to work in the garden or whatever in the evening . 
so , can i just ask you , are you canadian ? 
oh , really . 
say out , instead of out you say out . 
did you know that ? 
but , in school , ages ago , um , the professor had a lot of trouble with my accent . 
and it's probably because i was born in the chicago area and grew up in california , 
and at that point that was sort of the limit 
i see . 
but where did you grow up in california ? 
in santa barbara . 
oh , okay , 
because i grew up in north hollywood , california 
oh , i see . 
well , very good , 
i think we've probably know each other's exercise habits 
 and , uh , it was nice talking to you . 
well , same here . 
thanks for calling . 
oh , okay . 
so , um , well , i'll tell you , my situation is , uh , i have an elderly grandmother that we did just recently put in a nursing home . 
and , um , her son , which is my father is also elderly , 
and this is one of the reasons why she had to go to the nursing home , is that she was literally driving him nuts in his later years . 
now my father's almost eighty . 
my grandmother's almost ninetyseven . 
so , um , it's strange , because hit so close to home that um , my father's an only child , 
and really me and my sister are the only ones that will deal with my grandmother . 
she had many sisters , 
and a couple of them took care of her . 
and then one , her last sister died , 
and it was probably seven or eight months after that she had to go in a nursing home . because i was pretty much giving up my life , my sister was , and plus she was driving my father crazy . 
she went through three livein housekeepers . 
so , she's kind of cranky to get along with . 
there's nothing physically wrong with her , except she's very , very old , 
but her personality is very grating . 
 i mean , i hope i don't get like that when i get old . 
i have some great concerns about , uh , my parents and my relatives reaching that age . 
um , around here , where i live in maryland in the washington area , there's , 
and , uh , i used to live down in dallas , there was just so many stories about , uh , rest homes where the people are being abused , where the people are being kept in filthy conditions . 
in fact , here in baltimore they've actually shut a couple of them down and taken all the people out of them because they were so , uh , bug infested and rat infested . 
and , uh , i , 
it really concerns me , that , um , first of all , that anyone could let someone live like that , 
but if you have to , you know , how do you make sure , 
i mean , i'm sure when you make your appointment and go by , everybody puts on a happy face , um , 
you know , how are you sure that the home is really as good as it is , because once you put someone into there , you know , they may not like the fact that they've been put in there , 
and they might complain about the place all the time even though it's the best place in the whole world they could be , just because they want to make you feel guilty for putting them in there , 
and , you know . 
you don't know if their complaints are legitimate . 
um , we don't have that problem up here . 
we might maybe in a rural , uh , 
maybe there's uh , a bad home in a rural area , 
but it would be a very small one . 
um , the one my grandmother's in is very , um , hospital like . 
there were some really nice ones here . 
all the , 
a lot of the nursing homes around here have very good reputations . 
um , this one is more or less for someone who's poor and can't go there , 
and my father's , he's no by no means wealthy , 
but he's quite well off . 
and he could easily have put her into a nicer , um , home , 
but up here there's waiting lists . 
and that was the first one that opened . 
so , the professionals in the nursing homes really have to want to do what their doing , because it's a really trying job . 
i mean , i go up twice a week to see my grandmother , 
and i know the staff very well . 
so they can't hide anything on you or anything like that . 
but i have heard of really awful conditions , especially down the southern part of the the country which is . 
uh , that's true . 
uh , my grandmother's , um , 
last time my mother went down there to visit you know , they went in and she had roaches crawling on her . 
there were roaches even in her alarm clock . um , 
oh , that's terrible . 
it was absolutely horrible . 
they took her immediately out of there , 
and they just threw everything away that she had from there . 
i mean , they wouldn't even take uh , the , uh , the dresser that she had that was her own dresser , because it was just , you know , full of bugs . 
they just left everything . and , uh , bought her all brand new stuff , 
and they had to take her out of the home because of the conditions . 
and amazingly enough , the very next day they had an opening , 
and they put her into that opening . 
well , that's good . 
so is your grandmother , um , impaired ? 
is she of alzheimer's or something like that ? 
i'm not sure , um , what exactly is wrong with her . 
up until nineteen eightytwo , uh , 
actually , i'm sorry , not until , 
i guess it was around eightytwo , eightythree , i found out i had a grandmother . 
prior to that i was told that she was dead , 
and , um , apparently what had happened was that i had a grandfather who , um , put her into a mental institution . 
oh , that does happen . 
and , uh , you know , it was a real hushhush thing 
you know , my neighbors across the street , their mother was sick at times , 
and they couldn't handle her . 
so they put her in a home , 
and that happens a lot when people are sick or they just real manicdepressants , they end up being put in homes , 
and it's like , oh , well . 
but that's , 
i'm really glad that i come from an area where , um , there's good people in the homes . 
but it's just as , 
it doesn't matter if it is , like you say , the best place , they still don't want to go to these homes . 
and my grandmother's real , there , 
i mean , she cries every day . 
this has been over a year , 
and she tries to make me feel really guilty . 
but where my life begins . 
i mean , if that was my mother , i would really feel a lot more responsible . 
i would probably take care of my mother . 
i don't really , um , 
when my father , when something , 
if anything happens to him , i don't want him put in a nursing home just for the fact i don't really want to go and visit him at a nursing home . 
and hopefully that he can , uh , get along with , uh , inhouse help . 
so , he's going to probably , hopefully set it up so that he will be able to pay someone to come in and stay with him probably for sixteen hours a day , because i think that's the best situation , is when you get that old and you've been independent your whole life , you don't want to go into a home , because , like i say , my father's eighty , 
and he's really active . 
he still has his driver's license here , 
i mean , you wouldn't believe what he does . 
he actually tows cars . 
and , as the years go on , the tow trucks got better , more easier , 
and he went out and bought himself a flat bed one 
so he won't have to do very much work . 
so someone like that , i really don't want to see them go in a home . 
he's got two dogs that are his constant companions , 
and he always replaces them . 
you know , like , over the past thirty years i've had , you know , about seven or eight different dogs all the time . 
and it's like , 
you know , it's oops , 
dad's got these two 
and the old dies 
and the young one goes for a while , 
and he gets another one . 
so i can't see him without his animals . 
even though it's very expensive to stay at home 
i know . 
i mean , when you get on in your years it's the only thing you really have , 
and i'm thinking when i get older , i think if brought all my precious belongings with me , i think i could live in a home . 
i don't want to be selfish , you know , a burden on anyone . 
that's what i think , because i see what my grandmother puts me through , 
and i'm saying that when i get older i could probably make the best of this place , i mean . 
and of course , it's institutional food , 
and everybody hates it , 
and it's so ironic is that they go in there and they lose weight . 
it's a bad thing , 
i think it's fine , 
but , you know , my taste buds are pretty , uh , flexible , 
and here they're always used to these old fashioned foods . 
they're very set in their ways and used to have what they could get at home , 
and now they're feeding them , um , quiche and all kinds of strange food that we would eat . 
they don't feed them the old people food , the chicken and biscuits , and things like that . 
that's the thing my grandmother really misses , i mean , really growls about . 
my mother has made similar statements , that she doesn't want to become a burden to the family . 
  are the lines that come from her . 
i know , if people would think ahead of time and do things like that , like build the inlaw apartment 
well , that's what i'm telling my father now . 
he needs a new floor in his bathroom , 
so you can get in and out  . . . 
what kind of books do you like to read ,
uh , mainly ,
um , i've got that i do things with , 
so , uh , a lot of the reading that at my smalltime business uh , important issues such as a ,
what kind of business is it ? 
well , that sounds fun .
um , i've got a , uh , small distributorship , uh . 
i , uh , sell a , uh , healthy cookie on the side . 
and , uh , i have a few health food stores that i send it to . 
i can buy the cookies in a larger quantity than they can , 
so i can get a deal from the supplier , 
well , that's interesting . 
and then i distributed them 
and then i can sell them at a cheaper price . 
plus i've got a , uh , drinking water system business that i've had on the side for years that i've done . 
uh , yeah 
oh , really ? 
well that sounds interesting .
my mom always wants me to open a health food store 
but , i'm not really into it , 
i don't know that much about it , 
so anyway but , well that's interesting . 
personally , i like mostly um , 
if i had a book of my choice , i go to the library a lot 
and it seems like i always , i never go to the fiction section , 
i mean that to me is just ridiculous , 
it's like ,
but i always get books like , um , 
i like to quilt , 
well i'm not into quilting 
but i check a lot of books out to learn how . 
i just haven't done it yet because it seems to monstrous to do with a book , 
but i like to , um , can and do food preservation , 
and mostly canning just for fun to go pick the things and just to have fun doing it and to give them as gifts and stuff , 
and i like to check books out like that 
and i always come away with , 
i'm a christian 
and i enjoy reading books about um , 
   i have a real heart for people involved in cults 
and i'm going to bring my mormon neighbors some amish bread today 
and that's just where my heart is 
so , i read a lot of books on that 
and , you know christian books written by people you know to help you out and stuff 
  and i read the bible . 
i don't read the bible as much as i should 
but i think i would always think that no matter what i did 
but i do enjoy reading that 
 and , so pretty much we have different interests , i think , in reading , 
sounds like it . 
and he likes to run down the street with it 
and you can probably hear him . 
  but , um , i don't know 
so . do you enjoy reading anything like that ? um . 
there was a time when i was really into the home things , 
and i uh , had my own garden 
and i did canning , all those kind of things . 
that was when i was about , uh , ten years younger 
and uh , i had , 
thirty or younger ,
oh , ten years younger , 
oh , that's funny . 
and , uh , uh , and still having three left at home ,
um , i've tried to devote more time to them and trying to get them interested and spending more time at the library 
and it , 
i've been moderately successful ,
but , um , uh , they do read them . 
um , i have some books on health that i read all the time . 
one's on vitamins that are good for you and that kind of thing , 
oh , really ? 
 maureen solomon  .  a friend of mine has a book by her right now called foods that heal . 
they eat a lot of it , 
you know , you can take your vitamins 
and she was telling me to take zinc , 
so , to kill a horse probably 
i hope it doesn't hurt me 
but , anyway , .
there's uh , a couple called , um , oh , 
um , and , uh , there's a book called life extensions , 
i don't know if you've ever heard of it , 
it's a book called life extensions . 
there's also a book called the life extension companion , 
uh , dirk pearson and , 
oh , i forgot sally's last name , anyway it's a couple . 
i've seen them on t v , 
and , uh , and what you can't take 
the quantities 
what's the name of it again ? 
uh , yeah , 
i saw him probably seven years ago ,
oh , really ? 
 and , uh , i was pretty impressed . 
he had a , 
before he started out on his experiments he had a battery of tests done on his body to determine the age of each one of his organs 
and then he embarked on this , uh , vitamin treatment 
and then every year he had the same tests run , 
and at the age of thirtytwo , i think it was , his , um , heart was that of a fourteen year old 
 and all the rest of his organs were you know , all tested out greatly below his actual age . 
and , of course , sally , uh , isn't a very big woman , 
i mean , you know , she appeared to me to be very petite 
and um , she took a horse shoe turned it into an s , 
oh , really ? 
and , uh , it was all from taking the right vitamins and things that give you the strength , 
and , of course , doing isometric exercises , uh , together they both exercised about five minutes a day ,
i know there's not any food that you can get , 
and it's grown on good soil hardly anymore , 
and i know eastland , texas , which is in west texas , 
 and he owns a lot of acreage that's been farmed properly , you know 
 and , uh , we get blackeyed peas off of it and stuff 
but , i know that , you know , the further we go from adam the worse the food is for you , 
but god still somehow makes us all be able to still live . 
i think it's a miracle we're all still alive after so many generations , 
well the last couple of processed foods , 
you know , i mean , but , i don't know . 
i like to , 
i like to be able to eat really healthy , 
you know , i think jesus is the only one that can make this earth be restored to what it should be , 
but , uh , in the meantime we pray over our food because i'm always looking down my plate 
and i think man this   stuff was probably grown in who knows what , you know , kind of environment 
but i do take some vitamins on the side 
and , i do like reading books like that i have a hard time , a lot of the books are real new age oriented like mother earth 
and we're going to restore the earth . 
i just don't see that . 
i mean , i think to think that is almost , 
it's hopeless to think that man can do anything with the , 
you know what i'm saying ? 
and i think god's in charge 
and god's going to restore it when he wants to 
so sometimes i get bogged down you know , in the ideology that motivates a lot of health food and motivates a lot of vitamin taking , 
but , you know there's a balance in it sometimes i read stuff like that 
and then i just chunk off like water off your back , some of it , 
what i can do out of it that's practical , 
i've read a lot of things , um , since i got involved in the water business back in eightythree , 
um , and it's amazing that the legislation they have , um , for food that doesn't apply to water , 
they don't consider water a food 
 and , uh , the basics premise is that if water was a food you know , they wouldn't be able to sell it to you through your pipes because it's toxic . m , chlorine , 
it's a , 
i don't know if your on city water , 
city water has chlorine in it , 
they know that , 
they've proven that . 
the problem is that i've read books that ,
and we started doing , um , large quantities of chlorination of water starting around , uh , where we experimented with it in nineteen oh three and nineteen thirteen most of the major cities had chlorinated water .
you know i bet that's why we have some friends that eat only , 
i just took this amish bread out of the oven , 
man , it's going to be good . 
i had a starter that friend of mine made , 
anyway , uh , i had a friend that read a book on that 
and , um , i've , 
all my relatives my m , 
you know , you probably read back to eden or something , 
i don't know , 
  we read a lot , 
i know people have read all those books 
but , the , um , 
they drilled a well , i don't know how many feet 
but it's three or four times deeper than it needed to be , 
and so their water comes out , 
they live in grand prairie , 
but it's , 
they live kind of in the planes go right over from d f w , 
so it's not real developed , 
and so they have 
i'm very familiar with the area . 
and , yeah , 
and they drilled this well 
and the water comes out at thirtytwo degrees , 
so it's kinds of neat . 
would that be healthier to do that , to drill your own fresh water well like that ? 
it depends , uh , a lot of things were thought that , uh , as , 
well the ground will naturally filter out the  . . . 
uh , what kind of house do you live in ? 
uh , we live in a one story , just like a style home , you know , the standard texas , uh , fox and jacobs . 
oh , yeah . 
with , 
how about you guys ? 
i'm in an apartment in , uh , plano . 
well , they say those are or difficult to find . 
they are , if , uh , 
kind of depends on what you're looking for . 
mine's just a one bedroom place , 
that's , uh , 
how are rents doing ? 
i haven't looked at rents in a long time . 
uh , it's hard for me to tell , because i haven't rented in , uh , probably twenty , twentyfive years 
 and , uh , just , 
i'm getting back into apartment life , 
and it's , 
what's a one bedroom , 
are you in a , um 
 well , plano , 
most complexes in plano are pretty nice , 
so you're probably in a , you know , 
well , they vary , from place to place , 
it's hard to tell , you know , how well they've been kept up 
and these are probably , oh , one of the nicest that i found , 
and , uh , they're almost five hundred a month for 
i mean , 
it does , considering that , you know , uh , house payments are ,
i was going to say ,
you know , it drops , um , 
seems like in the last six months we , um , got lucky 
and we refinanced , 
and it , 
but it was like eight hundred and something , 
but it went down to like seven hundred and twenty 
 so that's really not , 
i have friends that pay about nine hundred dollars for a town house 
wow , that's a lot for a townhouse . 
actually they're near plano in north dallas too , 
but i couldn't believe it , 
but , you know , 
but that's what happens when you get up in this area , you know , you got all these companies are up here , 
and these 
 and , i guess they know they're going to get it , 
and then i think that , um , nobody was really buying houses there for a long time there because of just , 
i mean , we've been in ours for about ten years , 
but , uh there's no investment in it , 
you know 
that's true , 
you just 
 and that's about it , 
it's , uh , 
have you ever owned your own home , 
so you know what it's like , 
it's like , when you first , 
this is our third one , 
it's not , um , 
and it's not that exciting after a while .
well and especially around north dallas , or at least in plano area , they basically all look alike because fox and jacobs , 
suburban tract , 
uh , we lived out of state for a while and came back 
and , uh , we lived in a smaller city , 
and now we say , gee , dallas really is big and polluted .
isn't it . 
i can remember , 
i've only been here eight years , 
but i can remember coming to work from , 
i used to live in wylie 
 and i could see downtown dallas , 
and now there's this brown haze over it , 
it's really 
but just like with housing , i mean , they're not doing anything about pollution , 
it's going to look like , 
have you ever been to houston ? 
oh , yeah . 
you know , um , i used to think that dallas was better than houston because their zoning 
now it looks just like houston to me . 
it does . 
how long have you been in this house ? 
we've been in here ten years . 
ten years . 
so we've you know , got some investment in it , 
but , you really don't get anything out of it . 
you said you were out of state for a while , was that a smaller town than dallas area . 
we were up in pittsburgh , pennsylvania . 
how was it 
my home town . 
how were the house prices up there ? 
the prices , actually , a lot better , because pittsburgh is about the size , i've been trying to think , like a louisville , or minneapolis , that type of size . 
and the prices , what you get here for about a hundred thousand you could get there for about seventyfive , eighty . 
it's really , 
and we didn't think it was that clean , 
but then after you're gone for a while , it looks cleaner , you know 
oh , yeah 
 well , you know , a lot of these people that i've talked to that are coming down from , uh , like what i call , the back east 
and they've wound up getting better houses here than they had there 
 so in a way , i guess it works both ways . 
i guess it's , 
and here i guess it depends on what you want , 
you know , here ,   i got a lot of people that work for j c penney in marketing 
 and a lot of the people that came from that area , probably like what you're talking about , um , they had a lot of property but not a lot of house , 
and now they have a lot of house and hardly any yardage around it 
that's a fact , 
 but they love it . 
i mean , they think they're getting , 
you know , you say , sun room to them , and you enclose and you can sell it .
i guess that's true . 
and they don't have to worry about yard upkeep if they don't hardly have any . 
and a lot of them i know , a couple women that work there , 
and they don't miss , in public relations , 
and they don't miss having a basement to run up and down to , you know , 
that's true , 
not too many basements in texas . 
and i said , you haven't heard about tornados .
how about those , you know , 
gosh i remember when i was little , uh , we didn't have a , 
i grew up in southern oklahoma 
 and , uh , people across the street had a cellar , 
and we never did , 
and it's just like dallas area , it was tornado alley up there , 
and every spring mom would drag me up at three o'clock , four o'clock in the morning and pajamas and teddy bear across the street , 
and we'd go into the cellar , 
and i 
you know , if it's going to get me , it's get me . 
that's exactly , uh , 
i grew up in western pennsylvania , near pittsburgh , 
and , uh , we used to call the basements actual cellars , 
so it's funny to hear that word , because i never hear it , 
you know , it's like the back porch used to be a stoop , you know 
 but , uh , um , the housing is just , 
we like the older houses , 
and i don't know if we're going to stay here or not , depends , 
you know , i mean , 
you ever thought about building a house ? 
pardon me ? 
but some family things changed 
so we ended up come back down here , and all that , because it helped my husband's work , 
but , um , we really would like to , 
but we don't know if we're going to do it unless we stay here , you know . 
that's true , 
especially when , 
with t i it's like anybody else , you never know how long you're going to be in one place , you know , 
it's real tough , 
i mean , the economy any more , 
i mean , i think everybody just lives under an umbrella , the uncertainty with housing 
you know , it's , 
do you work ? 
pardon me ? 
well , how do you handle , 
do you have kids ? 
so you got , 
he's working and working to get this big house to take care of , 
how do you manage both of those ? 
uh , how do we take care of the house . 
well , i don't have a mexi , 
i shouldn't say that , 
i don't have an ethnic maid .
i don't have , 
we have some friends that live near north dallas off of campbell road , 
and they have like a four thousand square foot home , 
and she's got uh , a live out nanny . um , 
but any rate , i don't have any of that , um , 
i don't know , 
it's really not too difficult with no children and just two people , you know . 
you basically 
we have a , 
and we're pretty , 
i mean , we're not fanatically neat , 
but , um , we keep things up , you know 
what about home repairs and stuff , 
do you have to do all that yourself , 
um , no , 
we've been around long enough as a couple that we learned a long time ago not to wall paper together 
oh , you too . 
uh , we pretty much hire , 
we subcontract mostly everything 
i mean , i know how to fix a running toilet 
oh , yeah . 
he does what he needs to , 
but mostly if it's something major , um , you know , cleaning out the air conditioning ducts or something like that , we just hire out to do that , 
sounds like you've already got the makings for being a general contractor , 
no thanks , 
if you don't wall paper it well together , you should probably not build a house together . 
have you ever done that , 
i built three houses in my life 
and how'd that go ? 
the building process was a lot of fun 
 but puts a lot of strain on things . 
getting to agree to things , i'm sure , 
and i also think that once you get to be , um , you know , certain , 
when you get to be thirty something and thirty something gets to be a little bit older 
the dollar value on things 
you bet . 
you know , i think people that own homes a lot in north dallas are very materialistic . 
oh , you bet . 
but homes themselves , 
and you know , um , spending sixteen dollars a yard for custom draperies , for custom drapes just doesn't  , 
oh , yeah . 
well , to some of them i guess it doesn't matter , you know , that maybe 
i mean , uh , from new york with exxon or j c penney , 
and it's just a hoot to watch them . 
are they , 
as far as they're concerned , they've come to the promised land , 
you know , they've got it made , 
so , well was it hard to adjust living in an apartment after being in a house . 
oh , yeah , 
you know , i had a , 
i came out of a thirtyone hundred square foot two story 
oh , my goodness 
and i had room for everything , 
in fact i had more room than knew what to do with . 
i don't know 
just seems like stuff always expands to fill available space , 
well , in a way you can travel light . 
you can , 
you know , you lear , you adjust , you figure out , 
how is apartment dwelling living in terms of general privacy and noise and things like that ? 
it's not as bad as i thought it was 
it's not as bad as i remembered , especially going to college and living in apartments there , you know how noisy that can be . 
i do . 
uh , there seems to be more a mature crowd in , uh , apartments , at least where i am , uh , even though , you know , there's kids all around 
and there's traffic 
and there's people running up and down the sidewalks and stuff like that , 
but still , uh , 
everybody pretty much keeps to their own turf , so to speak . 
and , uh , there's never really any , 
oh i remember in school , 
there's just , 
seem like there was a fight or a party or something going on every night 
you don't run into that up here , i think because there's so many , uh , professional people , if you want to call them that 
and they want to come home 
and they want some quiet , 
relax and try to go to sleep , 
you see a lot of activity outside , people riding bikes , playing ball , or jogging 
or they're doing this and that , 
and to unwind . 
i think plano in general is getting a little more , 
well it's gotten so big it's almost a town in it's own right . 
oh , yeah , 
it's a hundred and what , eighty thousand , something like that . 
or something , 
the price of home , 
now oh , we paid , um about seventyeight nine for our house like i said , about a decade ago , not even , about nine years ago , 
and , i'd say they appraised it , 
maybe like five percent 
oh , yeah . 
 so it's an investment , 
but it's something that , 
you know , when you're first married or starting out , you think if you really have something , 
but you really , 
it's just real , 
nowadays , with the way the income tax , i think housing is strictly to itemize . 
oh , you bet , 
and the thing that gets me is , uh , you never really catch up , you never really finish doing things , 
and , uh 
and even , 
you know , i mean , like we had , i called them prefabs , just a tract home , 
you know , i mean , we had one of their homes that was nicer in pennsylvania , 
but , um , it was an older home , 
but then , you buy an older home and you're always fixing things up , 
oh , you are , constantly , 
there's always something going wrong , 
so , you know , 
so , uh , tell me about changes from say twenty years ago , since you were an adult , twenty years ago . 
well , let's see , well , we assume i was an adult twenty years ago , . m , 
well , you're able to , uh , vote and go to war and things like that
oh , that's right , 
that's one of the changes .
that was one of the changes that came about in the last twenty years . 
um , yeah , 
twenty years ago is nineteen seventy , 
uh , nineteen seventy i had been married two years . 
um , we had all the great civil rights legislation of nineteen sixtyeight , 
and , uh , around here on the , uh , east coast , uh , 
uh , the problem was that my hair was too long . 
and , uh ,   you weren't allowed to have a , uh , mustache or a beard , 
well if you were a , uh , black female you were destined to be store manager in six to nine months , 
if you were white male you're talking six years . 
and that's basically where i ended up . 
and is the company now , uh , well represented , uh , demographically , at the higher echelons ? 
did it work ? 
i stopped working for them in , uh , seventyeight , seventynine . 
and , uh , it's , 
i think they're like all companies , well represented . 
and , uh , you know , everything seems to be fine . 
i've kind of lost touch with the company ,
we had a falling out , 
 but , uh , as far were before management wise . 
but , uh , other changes , um , just people seem to be more outspoken now individually , rather than collectively . 
um , back in the seventies we had , uh , a lot of , uh , protests against the war , and , uh , bring our troops home 
and things were , more organized . 
and , uh , i've noticed , that now , more and more individual people are speaking out for their own rights rather than massing together . 
the me decade . 
and , uh , everybody was into me , 
and then we are getting back into us . 
but , um , it's 
i've seen , uh , uh , a great deal of change as far as , um , corporate responsibility and things , um , 
and , people's response to that , you know , at first not trusting and now , expecting more . 
and what about the last ten years that you've been aware . 
well , that i've been aware of , i've , 
at least in my own circles i've been aware of an increasing from my generation , 
i don't know if i can quite call myself a distinct generation from you , 
but half generation off , i guess . 
um , i've noticed , uh , a certain increase , um , pessimism with america no longer being sort of on top . 
i had the impression , 
 well , i mean , there was the quote , unquote losing of the vietnam war , which was a blow , 
and it was right around that time when i started becoming you know , a socially conscious adult . 
and , i realize that people of my age have um , no major success in the sense that , uh , you saw the passage of the civil rights act , and , um , major social change in that sense , 
and i , 
and all the changes that have happened in the last , uh , even during my adulthood , have been more incremental . 
they've been continual perhaps and good gains have been made , 
but there hasn't been the same sort of fiery speeches of martin luther king or whatever , that has really , uh , galvanized the population . 
and there's just , 
instead there's been sort of an increasing , oh , i don't know , japan bashing and things like that . 
and , uh , a lot of , 
i see among some of my friends and even more among some of my students , who are , you know , maybe twenty , a real sense of , you know , america's losing it . 
and losing it in the competitive market , 
and a real knowl , uh , 
a lack of understanding how that could be . in the sense that how could america have gone from being number one , to possibly being number two , 
you know , our former enemies and things like that 
uh , a lot of pessimism growing , 
um , and at the same time i think there's a growing environmentalist movement and sense of corporate respon , increased corporate responsible towards , uh , you know , environmental safety and things like that . 
and that might potentially be sort of the civil right , the equivalent of the civil rights act in the near future , in terms of , you know , some real landmark bills passing and things like that . 
such that , you know , people . 
the thing about civil rights is people take it for granted now . 
i mean my generation the glow of having achieved civil rights because we were born into an assumption that , you know , yes there's still some racism 
but , you know , basically things are , 
the assumption , things are basically kind of taken care of 
and there's a notion of fairness . 
that's , um , 
while still far from perfect , is much more established , i think . 
but even , uh , i think , uh , along the line of the , uh , goals of civil rights ,
oh , of course .
i mean , you know .
it's human nature 
you know , you either like someone or you don't like someone or you're just completely indifferent .
and the problem is that ideally you know , the world would like you to be completely indifferent . 
i understand what you say about the environmental movement , 
um , it's been a long time coming ,
and i just , 
i've seen a lot of changes , i mean , from the original earth day 
 and , um , i'm heavily involved in , you know , my own personal recycling . 
we recycle paper ,
and , you know , i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and ,
and i'm starting to see more and more recycling centers ,
and that's a real change , except it sort of , brings back to the nineteen forties more than anything else .
i mean , all this recycling used to be in tact , *[[typo in tact should be 'intact'
but much of it did . 
i mean , recycling was a wartime thing . 
and then they turned around and called them junkyards , and ,
and now we got to the point where the junkyards , you've got to pay them to take something there , 
so , things have really changed a lot . 
i think uh , the other part about , uh , america's decline i think has to do with , 
i have three children in school right now , 
and i'm not impressed with the teachers that are teaching them . 
uh , i had , 
when i was down in dallas for two years , i had , uh , my children come home from school with papers that were corrected by the teacher that had words spelled correctly marked wrong ,
and this person's teaching my children ? 
you know , i had a real problem with that . 
well , i'd say actually i mean as someone who's involved in education i'd say that maybe one of the changes is that the , role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society . 
i mean , relative pay which is a major way we value people , has been poorer and poorer over the years . 
uh , you know , that 
there's been cost of living increases 
but not quite in proportion to cost of living
and , you know it's just more and more , uh , a real low income sort of job and very low prestige . 
and if you have that kind of social attitude it's hard to get sufficient numbers of people who are going to overlook all of that work for lower pay , work for low social prestige , just because they care about good education . 
and you get more and more people   and up there because uh , it's the safety net of those of , you know , average intelligence or something , they can always teach . 
um , i'm not sure if your familiar with the movement they have here in maryland , 
but they're trying to get uh , a merit system here in maryland rather than a , uh , tenure system ,
so , uh , what are your favorite t v shows ?
one that i can't find anymore which is gabriel's fire . 
oh , i haven't watched that very much , 
is that , 
do you like that ? 
when was that on ? 
it was usually on , um , thursday nights . 
on a b c ? 
i don't know .
oh , oh , yeah , 
well , um , um , it may be that , um , it was recently replaced , by actually uh , um , twin peaks . 
it was same time period , 
so , twin peaks , um , what happened was , i think , twin peaks , um , and then put something , i guess , gabriel's fire on it , and at thursday nights , 
and then they moved , um , 
gabriel's fire was on c b s , i think , 
i take that back . 
i'm not sure , 
but anyway they moved it back and forth 
and that's when peaks was back in that time slot as well . 
so , i don't know . 
you don't know what happened to gabriel's fire then ? 
i don't think that was on a b c , anyway i don't know what happened to it though . 
i don't remember from one station to another . 
i keep forgetting one station . 
what's your second favorite ? 
um , it's hard to say 
i'm sort of a very big twin peaks fan ,
and beyond that i just sort of watch anything that happens to be on . 
half the time i'm a t v addict 
and the other half the time i just ignore it
it's really bad . 
there's some new shows that i sort of like , um , 
have you seen this  shannon field show  
or , uh , it's about a lawyer , it's one of these lawyer shows , you know , 
 they seem  to be popular these days . 
 and there's  a lot of those    blair  shows floating around . 
oh , is he the reformed , um , gambler ? 
 like  i just finished watching that a few minutes ago , .
um , and it 
and , that's a interesting one . 
there are   , 
station now has their own law show . 
there's l a law , 
and there's , um , equal justice , some other one , law and order or something . 
do you like the law shows 
what i do is i tape the programs i want to watch ,
and then on the nights i can watch , i'll pick out something . 
that makes  logic   , 
but , um , 
also  saves a lot of time  with commercials .
you're not kidding . 
do you ever watch american gladiators ? 
i guess it's on late saturday nights or something ,
 that's entering  the day as well . 
have you seen this often ? 
oh , really ? 
but i understand , uh , that in england , they play it at normal times because they don't consider that violent , 
and the reason they have it on here so late is because they consider it a violent program . 
and , i'm like , i don't believe this . 
that  don't , 
it seems like , 
i mean , if wrestling is prime time , professional wrestling , it seems like it's just like pros in a wrestling to me , 
i don't see any difference though , 
i don't either . 
i don't understand it , 
they consider it violent . 
i have  so ever   , 
i have seen it on ,  where we are   , 
i live in ,  uh   , rochester , new york , 
and i think a , 
you're in new york ? 
where are you ? 
i'm in dallas , texas . 
you're , uh , 
but i'm in new york 
and , uh , we seem to have , um , 
i think the american gladiators is on sunday afternoons actually around here as well ,
oh , really ? 
i think it's been on , 
i think i've seen it during the day . 
definitely seen it on ,  during the day down there   , 
and i don't think it's a very violent show , 
i think it's funny . 
i think it's a real good concept , 
i think it's something completely new . 
i think it's great . 
i love watching a microbiologist fighting off with a policemen or something else , 
i'm going oh , great , you know , 
it's a great role model for everybody . 
i think so , 
as well as , you know , some mental fitness 
and i think that people sort of learn good sportsmanship and so forth . 
oh , yes , 
i mean , when i had , uh , 
was watching it , the , first time i ever saw a microbiologist on there i thought well , it just goes to prove it has nothing to do with your physical capabilities .
and , uh , there she was terrific , 
well , don't they take people who have some sort of , um , big abilities like 
when it , 
the first ones i saw they had , um , a man on who uh , he played college football and almost went pro , 
and they had a woman who was a black belt in karate 
and uh , she was in the junior olympics or something 
or they seem to have people who have very , very big sports backgrounds . 
to have 
they , leaned away from that sort of , 
they hold competitions in los angeles in , um , florida and minneapolis , minnea , um , 
trying to think of , 
i think it's in four places around the united states . 
they hold competition 
and the only requirement is , of course , your skill of passing these tests , 
oh , that's how they do it . 
and we had a bar man from here in dallas area that made it . 
there is a woman that , uh , made , 
well , she called herself a craft person 
so , i'm not quite sure what she made . 
and , uh , she made it . 
i mean there is no , 
your occupation has nothing to do with it . 
i just thought they had some , 
strictly your skill . 
i thought they had some sort of , 
i mean , i thought they were just  poor people like us  i guess not , 
that's great . 
i'll get on there one day and see if i can , uh , um , 
what do they win , 
i think the last i heard was it's up to about a hundred fifty thousand dollars . 
all that for getting tennis balls shot at you at a hundred miles an hour . 
just minor little ball here or there , you know . 
and this guy's beating you up , 
i actually feel the tennis balls would hurt . 
oh , well , they , 
they look like , 
they seem like a tennis ball 
 but it almost  doesn't look like it's almost livable 
the best    
i could handle those tennis balls . 
so , what else to you tape besides american glad , at , 
there anything else ? 
see i tape murder she wrote . 
i like mysteries . 
oh , okay . 
i tape , um , father dowling ,
and i don't have to concentrate too hard on them . 
 but , i'm sure that's fun . 
um , most of the lawyer programs like , uh , law and order ,
oh , okay , 
well ,  they seem  to be on later , 
always right before the news is when i catch them . 
a good think for the day .
your news is on at eleven ? 
when is yours on ? 
i was just in the middle of watching it . 
oh , gosh , 
well , i'm sorry i interrupted , um , 
oh , that's okay . 
ours is on , 
no problem . 
actually it , 
ours is on at eleven 
it's , um , eleven o'clock now here or eleven twentyfive now here in new york . 
um , i think they do that , 
i think they put things on at , um , eleven o'clock here 
and i think they put it like eleven o'clock , um , california time , like in california 
but in the middle they sort of , um , 
like central time or mountain time they , they push things back . 
so , i was actually , actually 
 i'm not sure  
 , i was in iowa awhile ago , and noticed that everything was an hour earlier , 
so , does your prime time start at seven o'clock ? 
and they have it at nine , 
 and they have one at ten . 
not even the news 
but do they have like , um , 
do like sort of all the regular sitcoms and so forth , start at seven o'clock ? 
i'm trying to think . 
um , let's see they start , um , 
evening shade at seven 
and then it goes to , um , 
what is it after evening , um , 
because that would   the eight o'clock here . 
that's major dad at eight i think it is . 
at eight o'clock here ,
that wouldn't start at seven . 
we have , um , 
at seven o'clock we just have , um , 
you know , they have old reruns of cheers or something from seven to seven thirty , and then something else from seven thirty to eight 
and ours start at eight and end at eleven , 
that's why we   
i would actually like it better if everything started at seven and ended at ten . 
it's stopped around here at ten 
and it goes into night programs , at that point which could be one of , you know , many different night programs 
but it goes into night programs . 
oh , that's great . 
but , uh , do you ever watch cheers ? 
do you watch cheers 
oh , yeah , 
it's at , 
that was actually a big dilemma for me now because , um , cheers and twin peaks are now on the same time , 
so , jan , how do they recycle in texas ? 
well , i , 
the biggest , uh , most of the grocery stores 
and then they've just got different barrels setting out 
   , i shouldn't say barrels , like big  john doors  or ,
um , they've got them set outside 
is it , 
now , they do have some places where you can take things and get cash 
you know , they just want to , uh , help recycle . which is ,
probably the only thing , sometimes we'll take or the cans in 
and we let the kids get the money for that . 
but , uh , 
that's true , 
the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating . 
you know but , 
i guess , i , 
you see , i guess it depends on your landfill space . 
i know , i , 
we're in maryland , 
but , my , 
and my parents are forced recycling , 
oh , wow . 
uh , pennsylvania , ohio , and new york are some of the , uh , 
they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones . 
so , uh , it's , uh , really hard on them . 
now , up here in maryland , though , we're just in a voluntary recycling stage right now . 
uh , so my wife and i , you know , we save our bottles , 
and we save our newspapers , 
and we save all our plastic , and all of our tin cans . 
and just like you say , we go to , uh , a community area where they have it set up 
and we dump them off there . 
so , it's vol , 
you say it is all voluntary . 
do they , 
will it be mandatory ? 
is it all , um , 
is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff 
or is it all , 
mostly just the cans . 
and i , 
and that's , 
 and most of the time , like i said , that's a sort of like fund raiser things that ,
 that's true . 
cans are the only thing i think you really get money for . 
well , they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers ,
but , you know , i think a lot of people , like i said , are more concerned ,
i think that's mostly , 
well , you know , we , 
even before , 
it was , 
you know , and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be ,
well , i tell you , it's kind of funny now even at t i , i don't , 
do you work for t i ? 
um , at t i they're doing recycling . 
i mean , for a long time they didn't do this , 
but now they're recycling cans and paper . 
we have separate bins 
you know , and they , 
i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees 
and , you know 
 i can't believe that 
how well they're doing . 
we do , 
i work in a , uh , speech interface lab ,
 oh , okay . 
and we do basically the same thing . 
the state of maryland has asked all the colleges and universities , and some of the large organizations , you know , if they would definitely recycle their office paper . 
but , you know , in the giant bins around , 
and it's surprising how much 
you don't notice until , 
you know , they don't pick up your recycling until it's full 
i know .
reams of paper come ,
well , you think about ,
i mean , you know , cost wise and 
i mean , it's just amazing , you know , 
so , i think , 
you know , i guess a lot of the large organizations , probably t i , did they advertise on television how successful they are ? 
uh , but that doesn't mean that they don't . 
i don't watch much t v , 
but , i haven't really seen anything advertise publicly . 
and then , like i said , they do a lot of internal , 
internal . 
 but , i haven't seen anything . 
but see , i don't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway . 
i think they advertise more , um , other places where they're not located . 
that would probably ,
because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television , 
you know , they'll come up and say , 
you know , they'll show you  , to encourage recycling . 
and here , those of us that  dumavra  power , which is our power company ,
we now recycle fortyfive percent of our solid waste , 
and they , 
and that , 
we do this for the community , 
they put those on . 
and just with voluntary ,
well , even , i mean , in the kid's schools ,
so , i mean , the kids , i mean , they really try to educate all ages , you know , 
and it's good to start the kids real young on ,
i think so , too . 
i mean , it's like nobody was concerned about it . 
we weren't ,
 you know , and it's like , 
that's true . 
you know . and now everybody is doing something about , which is good . 
all of a sudden we're out of landfill . 
and they're saying , we estimate this landfill be ov , will be full in two years unless we cut back . 
so , i think that , that became , 
that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space ,
this is , 
so , what , 
you know , and no other state , 
i'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space . 
that's true . 
it's really ,
i think ,
i mean , this is such a tremendous ,
i mean , why , 
 i can't understand why nobody saw that before . 
i mean , even not 
but , well , 
well , in some ways , i guess , it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it , you know . because ,
but , the deinking process that they use , 
 and also , um , a , 
is not 
 oh , okay , 
and glass . 
so , i , 
it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before . 
that's true . 
 and even , 
i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil . 
and , i mean , that kind of surprises me .
i mean , you know , because once oil gets so , you know , thick and yucky , you'd wonder how they could , you know , clean that up ,
but they can . 
um , i don't know how cost efficient that would be , i guess , 
i don't know either . 
i know that though , um , the water table . 
 you know , they really pollute quickly 
and , you know , one , 
so , it's one of those things that they really , 
i know .
so , we'll have to keep our eyes on all that , i guess . 
i know i really , 
i don't know , 
i mean , i think that they really are doing a good thing now 
and i hope it keeps , 
well , i'm sure we'll keep up . 
 you know , 
i think it's really catching on . 
you know , i think that , 
i'm not sure if it , 
i don't know , 
i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory .
i do , too . 
um , it , 
so no . 
you know , so , i mean i don't know ,
i think that if the people are not forced to do it they may not , you ,
i mean , i don't know , 
i think a lot of people still will , 
you know , i know that it's really funny . 
my parents are forced to do it 
and they , 
 i mean , basically ? 
basically , no . 
i don't , 
i really can't disagree with it . 
i , uh , uh , 
the policy that t i has , i think is , uh , uh , very fair . 
um , i , 
they first had a policy where they , uh , would test new employees 
and , then since i've been with them the last four years , uh , there's been in the last year , year and a half , um , they're doing random testing of all employees . 
i think that's really the only fair way to do it . 
i really think it ought to be s , 
you know , junkins all the way down . 
and it is , 
as a matter of fact , i want to think they took the top managers first , 
isn't that a fact ? 
i've been retired from t i about a year , 
 but the program , you know , was still fairly new . 
i guess it had been going on , maybe almost a year ,
so i was not , uh , ever called upon to do a drug test . 
i certainly wouldn't object to it , 
and i think random is probably , you know , the only really fair way to do it . 
um , i like it because , um , 
you know , i grew up in the sixties , 
you know , i know my friends who were you know , druggies and ,
 oh , i , 
 and i think it's causing us a lot of trouble and , 
and so i'm hoping that , uh , a lot of other companies will follow the same path . 
especially if they have anything do with , you know , government contracts , or anything . 
as matter of fact , i want to believe that the , uh , defense department more or less mandated that people , you know , who work on defense contracts , you know , 
i think that's really what maybe prompted t i to do it . 
i was in the , uh , defense electronic division when i retired . 
i know you know , it was a real hot , hot item there . 
i want to think maybe they , you know , really got some nudging from , you know , d o d to do this sort of thing . 
so you know the atmosphere , then . 
 so , yeah . 
i agree . 
 i mean , i'd like to know that my child's being taught by a teacher who's not on drugs or , 
that's right . 
that's r , 
i d , 
i just can't disagree  with you   , with  you know  the basic premise . 
it's to m , 
as far as i know , it's , you know , seems to be a fairly accurate program , as far as , uh , you know , the testing goes . 
and , uh , 
and , i like the idea that they have a , uh , system where they allow you to , uh , be retested if for ,
that's right . 
that's right . 
and offer you , you know , help if you need help . 
rather than just , uh 
that's right . 
that's not going to help anybody get over the problem . 
i believe it is a medical problem . 
that's right . 
um , of course i also think smoking is the most addictive thing in the world , too .
oh , absolutely . 
not to mention alcohol . 
so i mean , there's a lot of things out there 
i'm just glad that they , uh , decided not to , uh , tax drugs , otherwise they'd be legal , 
 and they'd be getting tax money off it the same way ,
that's right .
oh , gosh . 
well , it's a real problem , 
i'm sure . 
i have friends that work in other companies that are just now adopting the policy ,
and uh , uh , i moved to a t i facility that , um , had never had , uh , random drug sampling before ,
it was , uh , an industrial company , you know , that t i purchased , 
and so the people here , a lot of them are real opposed to it . 
 oh , yeah , 
 and , you know , there was a few of them that obviously were doing drugs , 
 and that's why they were opposed to it . 
 that's  right . 
and , uh , it resulted in a few people leaving ,
 you know , they had a lifestyle 
and they weren't going to change it . 
and it's , 
i know a lot of people who , when it first be , 
or at least began , was in the talking sta , 
you know , everybody knew it was coming , 
but a lot of people , i think , after they thought about it for awhile , and you know , weighed the pros and cons , decided , you know , it's really not a bad idea unless you're doing drugs , of course . 
i mean , uh , you should have no objection to it , 
it's like , uh , going down to get your license and checking your eyes . 
that's right . 
 i mean , you know , why do i need my eyes checked , 
that's right , 
you know it's like , why are we doing this ? 
well , so you don't kill people on the road . 
that's right . 
or yourself 
 uh , it's a ba , 
i mean , it's the basic premise with ,
that's right . 
especially some of the jobs , um , 
luckily i've always been in the engineering sector , 
 and it's very little that anyone could do in the engineering sector as far as , uh , you know , hurting someone , i mean , 
it's hard to imagine somebody misusing a computer and somebody dying from it , 
that's true . 
but , uh , in the manufacturing sectors and over in semiconductor ,
assembly people . 
that's right . 
that's r , 
so , there's a lot of sectors where i think that would , would help out , 
and i think in the long run , we all benefit .
oh , absolutely , 
i mean , if you have , uh , 
you know , if you're not working with someone on drugs , well then you're going to have less accidents , 
 and you have less accidents 
and you spend less money on medical . 
 and you spend less money on medical , then the company's more profitable . 
 right  .
if they can pay you more , you can buy more , 
 and it , 
and it goes around ,
trickles up and down . 
all over . 
sure does . 
 and , uh , 
affects a lot of people . 
it certainly does 
 and start it up . 
i think they probably will . 
you know , if they , 
i'm sure it's a very expensive program to administer . 
i'm not sure every small company could do it . 
well , a lot of companies are , coming down in price , 
 and i think that the insurance companies are starting to give , uh , benefits . 
you know , in medical costs if , you know , they , 
it's got to help them too . 
so , i think everybody will benefit from the program . 
i do too , 
that's right . 
and of course , you know , the company's not going to reduce the employee's cost of insurance twenty per cent , they're going to reduce their own . 
but it'll save in some areas , 
and that'll cover it . 
and maybe some insurance companies might start offering it uh , as part of the package . 
that's right . 
that certainly could happen . 
that's a very very , very competitive business . 
so it , 
it's going to help out a lot . 
i do too . 
i just really can't disagree with you . 
well , it's nice to talk to you . 
and you take care . 
you do the same . 
so , the topic is vacations ? 
that's a good topic , huh ? .
i enjoy them . 
where did you go on your last vacation ? 
uh , the last was back down to lubbock to visit parents . 
it was , 
the last one was back down to lubbock , texas ,
but that's not the tradition for us . 
oh , yeah . 
what's your out of the state type , 
where do you like to go ? 
uh , we enjoyed yellow stone real well last year . 
what kind of , uh , vacation spots are there in colorado ? 
oh , rocky mountain national park . 
it's just like any of the other national parks . 
you know , there's camping and fishing and hiking and wildlife watching 
i think my parents took me there when i was real young . 
we went to colorado springs and , uh , rocky mountain national park . 
it was real pretty . 
oh , it's , 
got to see pike's peak . 
we usually try and drive up there , oh , once every year or two . 
you drive by yourself up there ? 
oh , wow . 
to the top the of the peak , 
oh , that's tough . 
i don't think i could do that .
oh , it's not bad at all . 
it's a beautiful drive . 
now i admit up there , the altitude is kind of interesting , 
you know you get a little lightheaded and giddy , 
but it's fun . you know , take along a picnic lunch 
sure is pretty up there . 
oh , we love it . 
you have mountains all around you ? 
uh , no , 
you know , it's right there at the very foot of the rockies . 
you know , and once a week we drive up into the mountains , you know , usually once a week , once every other week . 
that's neat . 
i'm jealous .
there's hills in texas . 
well , i enjoy hills , in texas too . 
i've been in sherman . 
i went to , uh , the bahamas last year , on a cruise for my honeymoon . 
uh , that's nice . 
it was really neat , 
i had never been really , out of texas or out of indiana much , out of the united states . 
i'm from indiana 
did you enjoy it ? 
it was really pretty down there . 
uh , got to eat some different kinds of foods and meet people from a different culture 
really did . 
in fact , one , uh , family that sat at our table every meal was from london , 
 and they had never been to the united states , 
so they were really enjoying it 
and they were telling us about all their trips . 
they had been to disneyland , 
and it was neat to meet different people . 
so the place that we've gone on vacation that i think i enjoyed the most ,
oh , really ? 
i've heard it's really pretty up there . 
well , we , uh , 
was , two years ago ,
i'm sorry , three years ago . 
it had been dry for a whole week . 
oh , wow . 
it didn't rain for a whole week . 
 , that would have been nice . 
that would have been best time to go . 
somehow we picked the right time and , uh , walked down on the wharf , 
and i think we ate seafood every meal for , well , not quite every meal , but most meals for a week . 
uh , it was wonderful . 
uh , the pacific science museum , the little girl really enjoyed . 
it's very interesting . 
it was super , 
and , uh , went to the seattle aquarium . 
and it's right there on the ocean , and down there on the wharf by the piers and all , 
and you walk down in a dome , a glass dome , 
 and the bay is circulating over your head , 
and you , 
 oh , wow . 
and oh it's , 
oh , neat . 
and then there's walrus and sea lion and porpoises , and oh , it's , 
without a doubt . 
seattle is beautiful , 
and the mountains , 
i've heard it is . 
i rode a ferry for the first time in my life . 
oh , wow . 
you know , up there , you go from the mainland to a whole bunch of islands around there by ferry ,
and you drive your car on . 
you park your car , 
you set your brake . 
you walk upstairs 
and you have a beer ,
it's amazing . 
and your car is on a ferry ? 
and it goes across with you ? 
that's really neat . 
and there are people , literally that everyday , take the ferry , you know , and drive ,
to work ? 
live on an island off shore from seattle . 
that's really wild . 
and , you , uh , 
everyday they drive on the ferry . 
they go upstairs and have their morning coffee . 
take , for the twenty to , hour and ten minutes that it takes to get across and , you know , depending on where it is . 
well , you know , 
that's really interesting . 
oh , it's strict , 
i'm a west texan . 
you know , it's a different life style than we are used to . 
it is . 
i've been wanting to go to the west texas , and see different parts of texas , because i haven't lived here very long , 
and i haven't really seen much . 
so what are some good things in texas to go visit ? 
oh , galveston . 
uh , there's , uh , 
one of the areas down there close to galveston is , 
i forget the name of the island , 
 but it's a bird sanctuary ,
and it's very pretty . 
of course , you haven't lived until you have been to san antone , to the , 
boardwalk and all that . 
the river walk . 
oh , it's , 
and you need to go in the spring when all the flowers are in bloom all up and down through there . 
oh , it's just simply beautiful . 
i've heard it's really pretty . 
and , of course , always when i lived in west texas , had to annually go down to san antone just , 
and go to , uh , lone star , 
and uh , you know make my annual pilgrimage to the lone star brewery , 
you know , go across the border and all . 
uh , the davis mountains are interesting ,
down by big bend ? 
uh , now the right time of year to go there is in the middle of winter ,
you know , whenever you've been kind of cold where you are at . it's most enjoyable ,
that's nice , 
uh , down there , in the lower rio grande valley closer to where the rio grande empties into the gulf , that's interesting . 
i love the texas hill country . 
and , uh , austin is neat for an occasional visit . 
i've heard to go to austin too . 
a lot people say to go down there . 
it's a fun few days . uh , 
what's there to see in austin ? 
oh , u t is real pretty . 
uh , there's a lot of little limestone lakes and caverns around that area , marble falls and all . 
that's real pretty . 
uh , i would say definitely go see that part 
and , uh , i'd say go to , uh , midland once , just for the heck of it . 
i don't know why , exactly . 
but , uh , you know , find out when they are holding the petroleum fair , uh , 
um , currently , i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program . 
i'm mainly do a lot of walking . 
i have a son that's a little bit overweight 
and , um , the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around . 
so my wife and i kind of take turns . 
at one time i had a fairly regular exercise program . 
but , in the last couple of months i've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down . 
all this space that normally would be dedicated towards the ,
um , what did you do when you did exercise regularly ? 
well , i had , uh , a little routine that i did for warm ups . 
and then i did some very mild , say , light weight lifting . 
i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles ,
um , right now , um , i try when it's nice out , 
it's been raining a lot this spring , 
but i try to , uh , 
i have a bicycle 
and i like to cycle a lot . 
and , uh , my husband and i , we have entered a few rallies , that's pretty popular in texas , 
i don't know ,
but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally 
and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles , which that's a lot of fun . 
um , so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that . 
and , um , t i , where i work has , uh , a fitness center 
so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends , we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill , 
and , um , they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine , that are fun to ride and workout on . 
so i try to , 
i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis . 
i used to , uh , get into it and get out of it based on my schedule , 
so i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now , 
but it's a big commitment . 
we don't have any kids yet 
so , that's a part of it . 
that's a plus . 
oh , i have a total of five children . 
i have three left living at home . 
and they do take up a big part of uh , my evening and weekend . 
and it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself , too . 
it's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up . 
when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children . 
that's why , overall fitness , you know , no smoking and all that . 
but it's hard to find , uh , an actual exercise regimen that work , for you , you know , because like i know a lot of people that cycle , they take their kids behind them on the bikes 
and i don't know if that would work for me because i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain . 
but it's really hard to find something that works , and , you know , to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever . 
i think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever . 
you have to , 
what i found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself . 
and you can use what ever rationale you want , 
but basically , the healthier you stay , the longer you'll live . 
and , uh , you know , if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer , well , then i'll around a lot longer , 
and those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now , well , you know , get the enjoyment of me , years past where i would have been if i wouldn't have taken it . 
if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that , it works out fine . 
um , i've been learning a lot lately about , um , 
i've been reading a book by kenneth cooper , 
i don't know if you're familiar with him 
he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really . 
he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing . 
and what was the other one , i think was , yeah , obesity . 
if you can control those three areas , then are you going to live longer , you know , cause those are risk factors , 
so anyway , 
oh , i've done a lot of study over the years 
and i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water . 
um , the research that i've done 
and i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eightythree . 
and , it's amazing , that , uh , you know , prior to like nineteentwenty there were very few heart attacks . 
there were none prior to nineteenhundred . 
well , in nineteenthree they started experimenting with chlorinating the water . in nineteenthirteen most of the major cities , 
and after that we , 
and , uh , dr . price wrote a book coronary , cholesterol , and chlorine . 
you can usually find it in a health food store . 
i know they had it in health food stores in plano , 
i used live in plano . 
dr . price ? 
and it's amazing , 
he makes the , 
you know , it's a very small book 
and the guys very opinionated , 
um , but he makes a very good case against chlorine . 
there were no heart attacks before we started using it 
and he points out that people in , uh , england 
uh , or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now , 
and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks . 
he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours .
and , uh , you know , he's , 
there's been a lot of reports since then . 
this whole thing about , 
first it was stress , then it went to cholesterol , 
and now they're saying what's cholesterol , 
well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol . 
you know , it's amazing what he points out in that book 
and , in fact , everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency , who did work back in nineteen eightysix , who wrote a letter to dr . price in nineteen eightyseven . and in this letter he praised dr . price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis . 
and , e p a never published that report . 
and what's the name of this book again ? 
i'll have to remember that . 
that will be very interesting . 
my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon 
so , he's really interested in the heart . 
and in fact , he's a , well , heart , too , 
uh , he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise .
he made me laugh . 
um , so anyway , 
there is a lot of good information out there , uh , about health . 
and a lot of the myths they've been passing around , people are starting to realize aren't true . 
i mean , i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that , because that's good for you , 
uh , but to believe some of the things , 
you know , and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet , 
but to think that solely , alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is just hard to believe . 
if you get a chance read dr . cooper's book on controlling cholesterol . 
that's a real good , 
um , he talks about that . 
talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that . 
i actually eat pretty much anything that i want . 
and i've had my cholesterol checked uh , a few times 
and i've never been above , like , you know , onehundred and fifty ,
and , uh , uh , i mean , i , 
you have a good ratio of good to bad .
but , i mean , you know , everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing .
you know , they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued . 
but , uh , we've , 
i work at the t i site in hunt valley , maryland . 
oh , really . 
and we've had a few of the health fairs up here 
and , um , you know , i've always come out aces . 
that's good . 
you know , i'm not really that big on watching what i eat , 
but i do eat , you know , some health cookies that are high in fiber ,
but , i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine , i'm not worried about it . 
okay , um , do you like to cook ? 
oh , really , 
what are you making ? 
um , um , i'm making , some , uh , 
i have a little turkey left from a passover which was in april . 
and i had frozen it 
and i'm defrosting that and making some dressing and gravy and making corn and wheat   stuff that you can buy at a store , which is like , uh , rice pilaf , 
 but we 
with wheat kernel that , 
and do you cook , 
i mean are you single do you cook every night for yourself ? 
and actually the , 
my wife is a vegetarian , 
 so this isn't for her , 
this is for our friends that came over and helped . 
he and i , 
and she's having , 
i do cook , um , virtually , 
i cook most of the time because i , 
well like if you were having a dinner party what , would you cook a variety of things , i mean , you know , vegetarian and nonvegetarian ? 
if we cook , 
if we have a dinner party we usually make it vegetarian just to make life easier . 
so we'll make you know , uh , some sort of pasta or something ,
that's something that's , you know , really easy . 
in fact i'm having a dinner party next saturday 
and that is what i'm having is pasta . 
oh , good idea . 
well for , 
 and all my friends are really anxious , you know , to have the homemade noodles 
so , um , 
we bought one in italy . 
that's the best kind to have . 
that's real good . 
but , um , yeah , 
so that's what i'm going to be cooking , you know , 
i thought i would 
   , um , pasta salad first , 
and , um , then just something for desert , you know , bread and wine and cheese stuff like that . 
that would be great . 
have you made pasta before ? 
um , a lot of fun actually . 
a lot of people think though that i've talked to about it think that it's , you know a lot of hard work 
and i said heck it's kind of easy . 
it actually is , if you have a food processor , 
i don't know if you have a food processor or not . 
  i making yucky   .
it's also , 
people think it's real hard , 
it just time consuming to get all of the little things right . 
otherwise it's real    , 
it's good stuff . 
what other kinds of , uh , dinner parties do you serve ? 
um , well , i don't entertain that often , 
uh , when i do though i have some friends that i always like to experiment on . 
but , you know , um , i see a recipe and think , oh wow , i'd really like to try this , cause i'm single 
and i live by myself , 
 so it's not necessarily something that i would cook just for myself . 
you didn't want to cook . 
here we go 
and usually i'm pretty good about it . 
that's great . 
um , i have this really good recipe for this , um , pork chop and apple casserole kind of thing 
and , um , you put stuffing and put poached apples and everything 
and my girlfriend and her husband loved it ,
and i was quite impressed with myself if i should say so . 
that's  how these things sort  of make it for one person as an experiment 
well , i'm the kind of cook that i don't normally measure things , 
i just kind of throw them in 
and , you know , i don't to the point of , you know , measuring down to the exact amount that they say . 
that means you're a real cook . 
 oh , is that what it means . 
it's real good . 
we do , uh , uh , middle eastern dinner quite a bit actually , 
we make , uh , cause we're my wife is syrian . 
and , um , her families always have this food she grew up in , 
and i've made some of it before as well , 
 so we make , uh , four or five middle eastern dishes that are just all real simple . 
we put them out for people 
you know , who've never tried it before . 
that's a fun idea i mean if you ever , uh , want something different to try . 
um , yeah , 
i've been wanting to take an , um , oriental cooking class 
and i just haven't gotten around to it yet . 
oh , do you have a wok though ? 
i stir fry things on occasion 
but i'd like to know more about , you know , more elaborate things like guess . 
it's easy , um , 
and the food just comes out , 
you know , if you do it right i think the food comes out very tasty not very mushy , 
 you know , and it doesn't taste like a million calories of oil 
 and that seems to , 
so wok food seems to be our thing . 
so anything else you cook .
um , i just kind of , you know cook here cook there .
i don't have any one specialty 
i mean i'm always willing to try anything usually . 
well , that's good , 
that's always the way to do it . 
i think  it's , uh ,  .
and i especially like baking and making deserts . 
i've taken a cake decorating class 
oh , the wilson course ? 
  i like it  .
that's great , 
i haven't   the wilson class . 
it's neat but it takes a long time , 
and it's like , you know , you bake the cakes 
and then i guess just because i don't have the expertise to just hurry up and do it ,
and , you know , it's a little time consuming , 
 but it's really worth your effort once you see how you do . 
we have , um , 
my brother can do it , 
 he's , uh , got a degree in business management 
so he learned uh , how to do this   .
can you hold on one second ? 
thank you . 
sorry about that . 
that's okay .
some one kept beeping in our calling waiting    , 
does that a lot , 
 so , you know , he cooks a lot 
and he made a real big cake himself , 
it was amazing 
i never    ,
and it's , 
well , you learn helpful hints in the classes at least . 
you know , the instructor told us certain things about well , don't follow what's really necessarily on the box , you know , if you're making just a cake from a box , you know , do this cause , you know , make it a variety . 
oh that you mean about the ,
 you know , some different hints . 
well , that helps . 
some different hints , you know , and the different kinds of frostings you can make , 
you know , and i have a book an it , 
and , you know , all of the different , you know , decorating tips an things like that . 
those kill me 
it's like i'm eating sugar , 
but they're good sugar . 
well , yeah 
i think  that's  part of the problem , 
so that's about it . 
i guess so . 
okay , well . 
it was a pleasure chatting with you . 
well , have a good time cooking for your dinner party next week . 
 thank you . 
uh , i , 
oh , okay . 
some things are serious 
and some aren't . 
i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is , uh 
not the biggest thing , 
but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information , uh , situation ,
when , um , 
i do feel it is 
but i don't know whether ,
well what's scary is , uh , uh , about two , three , four months ago in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here , the dallas morning news . 
they showed a reporter um , and a copy editor how they went out 
and they just took , um , a fellow in john q . public in dallas 
and all they had was , 
let's see , they had something like his birth date , the street address , 
um , they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name , excuse me , 
and it was , um , very scary to see what they found out . 
i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against , you know , two or three houses , through two divorces , children's names , locations , 
um , it was really frightening . 
well i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact ,
i understand , uh , 
i read the other day that , uh , these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone 
i feel that is an invasion of privacy 
but it , 
i do too , 
the other thing i don't like is , um , in terms of uh , 
like we just moved here from , uh , minneapolis 
and , uh , to get the very nice townhouse that we're in ,
you know , husband and wife , owners , um , who had never done this before . 
they , um , asked us for again an astounding amount of information 
and what we really didn't have the same opportunity , 
you know , and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too . 
um , in terms of the credit , 
i know , um , we're also going through adoption now , 
in for an adoption , 
um , so i mean it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try , um . 
i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me , uh 
go ahead . 
 uh , well , b , 
uh , i make my living by , uh , flying airplanes for , 
and , uh , uh , an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing . 
i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time , 
so a certain flight on a random basis i have to ,
 uh , probably cause , 
and , uh , a , 
  it isn't , 
and they've found , uh , i think , uh , in pilots anyway , of something like , uh , uh , eightysix thousand tests there's only been uh , three guys have come up positive , 
and one of them was a bad test , 
positive for anything , 
see yeah . 
 see , uh , and i just started working , well for an electronics firm down here , 
i used to be a reporter . 
and then now , i'm in corporate communications , 
and , uh , part of that excuse me , was , as a new hire , that i had to take a drug test , 
drug test , 
and i had never been asked that 
and i thought , um , i really didn't like it . 
um , i have very mixed feelings about it . 
um , i think that it's well 
and you're in that field , 
so i don't know , 
but it's , 
you know , we lived in , uh , minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas , 
that hit the fan like , uh , 
uh , you're obviously aware of that , um .
i am . 
i don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of , 
if they're going to do random , um , 
i don't agree with random , 
um , i don't see a problem with that . 
i do think , i see some level of necessity , um , in something where people are transporting other people , uh , only because of the things you've heard about . 
the problem is 
the reason i feel that way , even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the , you know , majority , um . 
i can understand the public's alarm to it , 
i'm not alarmed . 
but , i guess , having done this all my life , i knew that there wasn't a problem 
indeed it has proved out that way , 
you can't , 
i know , it's , um . 
i guess i feel bad because , 
uh , not only that 
but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints , i mean what happens if you say no . 
if you say no then you're excluded 
and i , 
doesn't seem the courts , 
it's a matter , 
and that's , um , exactly what it is . 
i mean , that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion . 
um , if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to romania . 
that's right . 
i mean , if , 
you hate to say that , 
but that's the way it is . 
it's my feeling also that although 
i do feel the courts in some of the , 
uh , i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy ,
but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that , it does seem that we've slipped and that's eroded , 
or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that , you know , it's fair game , 
you have to answer these questions , of course . 
uh , i don't know , 
i feel there has been an erosion 
and i don't really know how serious it is , except i don't like it .
in terms of the privacy , yeah , 
that in it , 
and also , i agree with that 
i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade , 
and that was preaids and all the other , um , things ,
and i have a real problem with medical professionals , 
um , it goes back to the things like drug screening 
but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment , 
um , and i think this is much stronger than , you know , pilots or , uh , train engineers being screened , 
um , the transmission of the aids virus , um , 
that's a real ethical problem . 
i mean i don't have the answer , 
 you know , i mean i think of the young girl in florida who , 
well , yeah 
was she from your part of the country ? 
what was that ? 
oh , yeah , 
and then they proved it , 
i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general , or what , um , 
well i mean it , 
just take where now we feel there's a need to do that 
and the next thing you know then ,
oh , yeah , 
i guess the question is , uh , 
the thing for me is , who sets the parameters or who has the control , you know . 
i guess so , 
i mean well , uh , good luck to you , 
you just moved to texas 
uh , i don't , 
i think they'll be a cultural shock . 
i mean i was based there a lot , uh , several times in the service 
and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the , 
some of the , 
oh it's ter , 
i'm , uh , 
very seriously , 
more than just seriously , 
i'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall . 
oh yeah . 
and , yeah , 
and , in terms of things like privacy , the way the law is interpreted , presented , 
um , it's no better than journalism .
um , this is very frightening in that , uh , oh , 
and they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents ,
they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check . 
yet , if you're caught with , 
let's just say , um , that somebody who's in ne , 
not us , 
but somebody who's need of carting , um , aluminum beer cans around , 
they haven't touched them , 
they haven't drank them , 
they picked them up off the street 
and they want to take them to a recycling , uh , resource 
um , they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again , um , because they've been arresting people like that . 
well , i mean , i don't understand , 
you know . 
if you don't , 
if they don't make a criminal check , why do you have to be fingerprinted . 
because , um , in our case , one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level . because you have to deal with the i n , 
because you have to deal with the , uh , imi , immigration service . 
 oh , i see , 
oh the state doesn't require it . 
it's , uh , 
the whole thing is , 
i mean again there's no consistency . 
you know , like in your , 
in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly , um , i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval , 
or you know , i mean 
well why not , 
the next thing you know , we'll just stop a random amount of motorists 
and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street . 
they do that in texas . 
oh , they do ? 
what they do is they check to see if you've got , uh , current insurance 
or they check to , 
well there's all sorts of scare tactics , i guess , to , to invade our privacy 
i know 
and it's kind of , um , 
what's the word i want , 
i don't , 
it's ju , 
to me it's just frightening , you know . 
i mean the old , uh , 
i'm old enough now where george orwell , 
uh , way past time .
i just going to say , nineteen eightyfour ,
but it's here . 
it's exactly true , 
i mean i , 
and the computers , of course helps that . 
the computer abilities store that information . 
 i mean , it's , 
i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger , you know , 
well , what kind of music did you all listen to ? .
oh , my goodness . 
now see , we think of classic rock that they , you know , have on all the easy listening stations now 
i mean it was , 
i mean we were there . 
now , well then you was , in the , uh , 
or , i am sorry , 
i was , 
i am going to make you sound like you're 
well , i was , 
i was 
what was , 
well , i wanted to go . 
i was in chicago . 
and i guess i was close to eighteen or something . 
i can't quite remember the year . 
and , uh , 
you would have had a ball . 
uh , yeah . 
would have liked to have been there . 
we could not get it together to drive . 
i mean , you know , we had never driven outside of , you know , 
and here we were all hep to go to woodstock , you know . 
oh , that would have been such a great memory . 
it would have been incredible . 
i think of , uh , you know , all the , social changes that were going on around that time . and , 
well , i mean , i remember we had the first earth day back then , you know , 
we got out of school at , uh , the university , 
and we celebrated earth day . 
you went and planted a tree or something ? 
and we did not realize , you know , the implications of all that then ,
 when i grew up , we did not have any causes . 
to me it doesn't seem like we have got much , 
you know what i mean ? 
i mean there was no name to it . 
it was everything that was started in the sixties . 
well , i do remember demonstrations over busing . 
and busing themsel , 
it was like just a continuum . 
you know , everything sort of had a seed in the sixties . 
and women's rights , i mean , things for women were totally different for you by that time . 
well , right . 
by the time i was born , even now , you know , women's rights , uh , 
we just , 
you just assume . 
we are totally equal now . 
there is not really a lot to fight over . 
now i saw something on t v last night on twentytwenty . 
you know , men's , uh , fathers or daddies , 
now wait a minute , 
daddies are people too . 
it is about a lot of men , you know , going through divorces . 
the judge will usually , uh , give custody to the mother ninetyseven percent of the time . because they go through the female . 
but it does seem , you know , 
it seems unfair . 
it really does . 
but it , 
see men are coming into their own 
they are , well , 
i thought about that . 
i thought well , now men , you know , have to fight to be equal . 
and i think that is only right though , really . 
they always follow the heifer ." 
well , are you married 
and do you have children ? 
and i have got two kids . 
two kids . 
and how does your husband respond to all the new ,
my husband is not a conformist at all . 
he is still back there in the seventies .
 well , i mean he is still wearing but , 
well i do not like them 
they are 
any day now .
well , he is his own person . 
but he wears what clothes he wants to . which we are both that way . 
if something is out of style , i do not really care . 
if i like it i am going to wear it . 
but , uh , my husband is not a conformist at all .
well see , that is the spirit of the sixties . 
and whether we are talking about the rain forests . 
i tell 
 you know , the situation you have right now 
and all of our generations is what to do with the children . because both mother and father have to work now . 
well , uh , we are trying to keep away from that . 
my husband works for the railroad . 
oh , okay . 
we have got it real tight . 
but i have got a four month old baby , 
and i do not want to work . 
i want to tend to her . 
i want to raise my kids . 
you do not know what you are changing when you do something like that . 
you do not understand the total commitment it takes to be a parent . 
well , when he grew up , he grew up with his , 
we both grew up with single mothers . 
and my mom had six kids . 
so , she had to work . 
and , you know , i was raised by my sisters and stuff . 
and i can't see the difference . 
but i know that it would have been better had mom been able to stay home with us . 
that one person 
and my husband was the same way . 
and we just , 
i want to raise my kids . 
i do not want a day care or an aunt or anybody else raising them . 
i want to be there to make sure that , 
well , they need guidance 
and they do need parental guidance 
they definitely 
do you stay home with yours ? 
i have not , 
i had an unfortunate thing happen , 
and i am , you know , 
and it is not going to happen that way . 
but my , uh , friends are having babies right and left , 
so i get to see the different ways that they ,
they raise them . 
and one gal , she started a business ,
and she hired an au pair , which is a college kid to come in and take care of her two boys while she works in the other end of the house . 
well , but see now , 
and the guy lives in with her , you know , 
 i mean , you know , it is a family sort of unit sort of thing 
and the , 
okay , sweetie . 
let mommy talk . 
and so , 
well , i think that's neat . 
so that is a different way . 
and then my other girlfriend just , you know , tears her hair out and goes at it , you know , twentyfour hours a day , watching both kids all the time . 
and i think there is a point where you just have to get away . 
and it is good for the kid 
and it is good for you to develop , you know , your interest so you do not stop growing 
well , i know the family is really going through changes . 
but now , we are trying to go back to about the sixties , you know , when the mother was staying at home . 
 unit  .
or that , 
but , uh , .
do you have any , uh , 
do you have your mom or anybody around you that 
 well , my family is kentucky . 
her husband happened to get a job at t i .
they moved out here , 
but w , 
his family lives here 
and , my husband was in the service when i met him . 
and so we've been all over 
then i , 
 he got a sunburn 
and he is itching , 
so i am keep having to scratch his back . 
see , uh , i would love to get a business going out of my home . 
outside of , i mean , going , 
well , that is , 
i would rather work at home , if i could . 
well , see and that is , uh , the sort of the thing of the nineties is 
they are bringing i mean big businesses into their home . 
bringing their computers home 
and i think , you know , the more we try to , you know , shape that , the more input we ,
that is , 
 well , i think , 
it is , uh , 
kids could see their parents , you know , how hard they work , 
they would understand more . 
when , uh , we first moved down here , i was working . 
i was working a twelve hour shift , 
and it was three and four days a week . 
and , uh , 
 oh , my little boy because he had been used to me 
being there all 
and he is just now , 
well , when i got pregnant , i went ahead and quit work and decided just to stay at home 
and it was costing too much at home , i was bringing in . 
see the economic situation on the whole thing . 
and then , uh , well it is , 
see we do have things that we are concerned about here . 
this generation , 
i don't know . 
social change is always going to go on , 
but i think we have taken a big leap in the last , you know , twenty , thirty years . 
and , uh , nothing is the same . 
it seems like it is totally different . 
of course , i do not have much to compare it to . 
to me ,
do you know what i mean ? 
but we passed them on to you , you know , 
i mean , 
you what ? 
we passed them on to us . 
i mean , you know , because it takes a lot of hard work . 
it takes writing letters to congressmen and , 
and , uh , you know , um , did we make the right choices ? 
we do not know , 
we will never know . 
i mean , you know , i think we made a wrong choice when i look at the children of today . 
i think we made some big wrong choices . 
and i think business got in the way . 
i think the greed of the eighties got , 
well , what's your opinion about capital punishment ? 
well , cathy , i think that , uh , capital punishment certainly has a place in our society , um , maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated , even in the remote chance of repetition . 
i think i would agree with you on that , too . 
 you know , paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem . 
maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped . 
um , i'm , 
what i don't know , is where do we draw the line . 
uh , do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime , 
or do we extend it beyond that ? 
well , either , you know . 
uh , i have a nine year old daughter , 
and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes , that i would consider basis for murder . 
well that really gets into a sticky issue . 
uh , i could see that too . 
i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for . 
but , gosh , 
and who's going to decide which is how bad , you know , 
something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me , 
it does . 
a lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and , um , to what's allowable and where are we . 
uh , you know , if we lived in a different country , then murder is not so bad . 
but over here , where we're promised the civil liberties of a heinous act . 
in some eyes . 
i think some people give up that .
i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than what most people think of them as . 
i don't know what , um , texas's criteria for capital punishment is , 
do you know ? 
are there some set guidelines , like only under these circumstances ? 
i don't know . 
i believe it's , uh , at the discretion of the judge or jury . 
i used to live in virginia , 
and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only , um , if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder . 
those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty , which i think is a little too limited . 
i tend to agree with you there . 
um , my belief is that , um , any crime that's freely committed , you know 
freedom of choice 
these people had a choice of committing this crime , that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life 
but then i'm also told that i'm a pretty harsh person . 
in general terms i'm not so harsh , 
so , i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh , too , as far as that goes . 
i think you're right , 
that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime , 
they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life , 
just beca , you know , 
they ruin someone else's life . 
all right , 
i can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food 
you know , that second group of people falls into the group that i say give up their rights , 
the first guy , you know i just assumed it was a guy , the first person ,
that's right 
or with the , 
what about , uh , like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that . say fifteen , sixteen year old . 
would you consider , uh , capital punishment for them ? 
i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen . 
there's some , 
and i certainly don't know myself , 
but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include of long term consequences 
what age they're accountable ,
and , uh , well he's nineteen now , 
and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year , 
and i have an eleven year old and a nine year old , 
and i don't see it in them yet , 
but i'm not sure where it begins . 
i know that they are lowering the age of , uh , whatever is considered a minor . 
i think certain kids have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be , 
i think i read about a boy that was nine or ten , that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them , 
and they were trying to charge him as a , 
first how much television watching do you do ? 
i do a little bit more than i think usual people do because i am here alone during the day , 
and i like it just for the noise .
that's right , 
but do you actually watch it ,
or is it more of a company ? 
it just depends on what it is . 
i mean , i have my favorite things that i do , 
and then some fun thing to do sometime . 
um , what about you ? 
well , actually , i work full time 
and when i am not working i am running 
and i do not watch a lot of television 
and i am very selective in what i watch . 
if there's something that i absolutely want to watch i will turn it on and watch it and then turn it off . 
i probably watch television four hours a week , max . 
well see that's great , 
and , uh , 
if i do not find something that i really want or really want to watch , well , then i just do not turn it on . 
i would rather listen to music . 
part of it is that , uh , i think we need to be very selective about the kinds of things that come to us on a subliminal basis 
and i think that if we are doing other things and these programs come in , sometimes they influence us 
and we do not know where that influence came from . 
i think you have to have the will and the , 
and , uh , anyway , i think it , 
uh , right , 
you would be susceptible to stuff . 
of course , i , uh , 
and it has to be reinforced at another level too . 
do you like specials ? 
those are fascinating to me . 
if i have the opportunity , i watch it . 
unfortunately , i was with someone else who was flipping channels . 
i hate that . 
i do not care a whole lot for some of the contemporary humor . 
oh , right , 
in our comedy programs , although , 
nobody can appreciate comedy any more than i can , 
but i would prefer to find , a good comedian on one of the educational channels or one of the older comedians . 
well , we have cable also , 
and sometimes you can , um , get the h b o specials , 
and sometimes those are really ,
so , i like to watch comedy , 
i mean , 
and that's something . 
i enjoy comedy . 
i guess i have my old favorites , 
bob newhart is still on . 
i watch him . 
i enjoy that , 
and , uh , you know , something on that level , 
i also enjoy , uh , 
i do not know , 
sunday mornings , it's channel thirteen , 
i watch a lot ,
and i , 
that's right . 
i mean , i think that's so hysterical ,
it's just so much fun . 
it's just a lot of fun ,
i mean , i do not agree with a whole lot of the stuff the , they say , 
so , yeah , 
well  , 
i like to be entertained , 
i really do .
i watch it for entertainment , 
but i also watch it for , uh , cultural impact . 
i do a lot of channel thirteen , channel three , some of the educational channels , 
and i watch for special programs that have a special play , a special concert , uh , 
i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars . 
oh , now that was fabulous , 
and that , you know , 
i was just absolutely , 
you just held you breath ,
  and , uh , 
oh , i was just , 
it makes chills all ,
i know . 
i may or may not even look at the t v guide , 
but if i have time i may flip through and say hey this looks good if i finish this task i can watch that in an hour . 
 uh , if the hour comes and i do not get a chance to watch it , so what . 
you know , well , there's certain thin , 
i mean , 
i have got , um , my t v in the kitchen here 
i love to watch cooking shows . 
i really do . 
i do too , 
it makes me want to cook , 
i know  , 
and then i eat , 
and then i get fat , 
so , i just let other people watch 
then i eat what they cook .
and there's some , um , 
in fact , one of the water color shows , i know , has inspired me to take water color lessons , you know . 
oh , i think that's ,
oh , yeah , 
i took a lot of my , 
so that , 
it's very successful for some of ,
but i think i really got stung very badly about having influence in your life , 
or at least i saw a very bad example of having television influence your life , uh , 
my husband had an aunt who was addicted to soaps , 
and , i want you to know that became the most suspicious , cantankerous , contrary old ever walked . 
i do not know who she thought she was , 
but she just got to the point where you could almost hear those soaps being echoed in her voice ,
 and for her to miss a soap , it was a big withdrawal . 
oh , well , see that's , 
but she was probably depressed to begin with . 
well , i do not know . 
you know what i mean ? 
well , she was grumpy to begin with . 
grumpy to begin with . 
there's no doubt about that , 
uh , but you could clearly see those influences ,
i know that one day , uh , my youngsters were watching the three stooges , 
and i always thought that was just casual slap stick ,
i hate that show .
but when one tries to lift the other one up with a pipe wrench , i decided that was not funny ,
and , i really , 
i think that is , 
the kids watch that 
and that's absolutely the mouthiest kid i ever saw . 
and i do not like it . 
is not that amazing . 
how old are your kids ? 
mine are grown , 
but i have grandchildren .
oh , okay , 
so that's , 
and , uh , for a four year old to think bart simpson is a hero is tragic .
i had forgotten about that , 
see , it's just my husband and i 
but , uh , um , i don't know . 
well , i was very careful even when my kids were , 
and when they were young i really did , uh , watch what they watched . 
i was cau , 
i sat down with them 
and i watched it , 
and if i did not like it , i changed the channel for them . you know , 
i just wou , 
and you know we get it at school , too , 
anyway , so you might as well not ,
that's right , 
they are mouthy enough anyway . 
i remember going to sch , 
my parents were a lot like , too 
and , my parents never let me watch anything like that . 
i could watch yogi bear , you know , 
what kind of culture was that  ? 
and , i remember going to school the next day 
and did you see , 
and i could never participate . 
and it always made me feel a little bit , you know , a loner 
like i , you know , 
but , uh , 
but see , then my parents , 
well , i did , 
to , uh , 
i ran my kids to death .
i said , hey , i think that's enough television for awhile , 
maybe we need to go outside , 
and we need to go out and play and enjoy some company . 
so i would go out with them , 
now see there's the problem , parents do not do that . 
that's true . 
or , you go rent a video up at ,
i said , 
and we did other things . 
and i think that was , 
well you know , that's something people do not do , 
well , here we are talking on that subject , 
but that's an interesting concept 
i have got to stick in my    , uh , 
of course , 
you know work with kids   
but , uh , . 
are you one who gives dinner parties very often ? 
they are a lot of work , 
that is for sure . 
they are , 
i mean i do them , 
i usually have them when there is a special event in our lives 
and i , 
and , uh , i think i am most , uh , happiest with my most ,
you know , and i make my own pies and pie crust 
i do not need a recipe to follow . 
and , uh , 
oh , that's great . 
you sound like my mother who has been , 
well i bake pies too , 
but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family 
and she has the same technique , 
i mean , i guess after many years of doing it , you just ,
you just know from heart . 
i had one of the ladies at church that tasted my coconut cream pie 
and i made her one . 
that was a big pie . 
well , there is a woman in our choir , who is nearly famous for her apple pies , 
and , uh , we had an auction one time at the church 
she must have a great pie recipe then . 
well , i think i have had it once 
and it has been a few years ago , 
but i do recall that it was quite good , 
so , uh , 
so , that is her specialty , uh , 
i like to bake , uh , also , 
i do not bake so much now that my children are grown , 
but i do enjoy baking 
and i guess i always liked making , uh , cookies and bars and things like that , 
that was more my specialty ,
and they seem to last longer than pies around here 
pies would go practically ,
that's right , 
they are meant for that evening's ,
and , you know , it has got to be gone or daddy gets into you know , the leftovers . 
puts about two more inches on his waistline 
and then he is chastising , 
 and    , 
well , it is interesting that , 
yesterday , i had lunch with a friend 
and she was telling me that she had a dinner party over the weekend ,
for , um , uh , 
one of her acquaintances , one of her old friends , i guess , had been in town 
and , uh , they invited two other couples over 
and so there were seven of them that , uh , 
i said "well , what did you have" 
but , you know , she had , uh , uh , guacamole 
and , uh , i cannot remember all she had . 
but she also had made , uh , flan , which is actually spanish , i think . 
have you ever made that or had it ? 
uh , it's , um , 
i had , used to work with a gentleman who was from cuba , who would make it ,
it's just a wonderful dessert . 
it's like , uh , an egg custard in a caramelized sugar ,
oh , okay . 
and actually , not very difficult to make , 
but it's very , very high in cholesterol , i am sure with all the eggs that are in it . 
but , uh , she said that she and her husband had , uh , traveled in spain a couple years ago . 
and flan is almost , uh , a basic with every meal that you get ,
like apple pie in america , 
right . 
it's just very customary to get flan . 
so if you ever run into that you will sort ,
but , uh , i would never have thought of making that as part of a mexican dinner , 
but , you know , sopapillas , i guess , would be another kind of a dessert , if you decided to do something like that . 
but  , 
flan is something you can ,
but , uh . well , i would , have been thinking i would like to have a dinner party sometime soon , 
but i tell you it , 
it's one of those things where it does require some real , uh , planning 
you don't just make the dinner , 
you have the house to clean and , you know , the whole business that goes with it . 
well , when i have a dinner party that is my motivation for getting the ,
probably a good way to do it . 
we are catering a wedding , uh , um , in august 
it at , 
it's at her house , 
she is not a good housekeeper . 
so she has got to hire this crew ,
and there , you know , 
she must have found some jewels ,
oh , wow . 
that is such a nice thing , 
i , you know , 
well we have , 
my husband and i have been married twenty six years , 
and until last year i had never had another person clean my house , 
and so , i had a woman come in , uh , once a month , 
and you know , it was  not  just very often , 
but for me it was wonderful .
that is nice , you know , to have that , 
that's a ,
it is , 
and it buys you time to do other things , like have a dinner party , i guess . 
that's right , 
so , it is just a real gift of time as far as i am concerned , 
but , well , uh , i , 
that is unique ,
i have heard about that . 
have you ? 
but i have never tried it . 
i do not know that it has egg in it . 
do you have it right on the top of you head ? .
uh , i , 
i , uh , 
you do not have it , 
 i would   , 
well , it , 
like the liquid is like ,
and you mix that together 
and then you know , your , 
see it makes , uh , five pie crusts at once . 
uh , quite large , 
so , that , 
it's quite a volume of , 
i think it's four cups of floor , 
and , like , uh , a tablespoon of salt and a tablespoon of sugar 
and then you , uh , put in your liquid . 
uh , what is it about the , uh , the vinegar that , uh , makes ,
it just , 
and , you can really treat it rough 
and you are still going to have a flaky pie crust . 
boy , that's the real secret . 
like , uh , it's not mine , 
it was from one of the magazines , probably , twenty years ago 
i thought , wow , quite a statement for them to make . 
oh , th , 
it makes me think of years ago , uh , when i was visiting my motherinlaw in , uh , michigan , 
she lived very near an apple orchard 
and we just had , 
we could take as many apples as we wanted from it . 
you know , according to the owners , 
and so i decided to bake about four pies ahead , you know , 
well , talk about working with big amounts of pie crust , and having it be tough . 
those were the toughest or apple , uh , pie crust , 
oh , wow . 
it was terrible . 
i could have used that recipe , 
it sounds like . 
 well , i am from michigan . 
where about ? 
well , we lived in plymouth for four years , uh , 
oh yeah , 
that's real close . 
in fact , we were there from , uh , seventy three to seventy seven 
 and , uh , my husband is from the upper peninsula , 
so he was born and ,
that is where my motherinlaw still lives , 
so , uh . are you originally from michigan 
oh , yes . 
born in detroit . 
i think the last one that we actually went to go see , 
well , there's two . 
i took my kids to see a hundred and one dalmatians 
of course they wanted to see it . 
they had the disney 
and they loved the dogs , 
it's one of my 
we went with some friends of ours , 
and i was a little worried about my son . 
he's about two and a half 
 and he's going through a stage right now where he's kind of afraid of dogs barking if he can 
 and he did real good through the whole movie except the part where the dogs are sending the message , you know , that the puppies are missing 
oh , yeah . 
 and it shows the town , 
and you can hear all the barking , 
a whole lot , 
kind of dark , 
so that kind of bothered him 
 but after that he did fine . 
well , how , 
is he young ? 
that makes sense . 
well , my kids' very favorite , and yours may be too young for it , was home alone . 
i loved that movie . 
they , uh , 
well we do , too , 
but they just want to rent that one . 
that is their very favorite . 
they think they're so cute . 
probably gives them ideas of what they want to do , 
right .
we're not real big movie goers ourselves , 
but we did try to go see about a month ago that , um , dead again 
and i was not real impressed with it . 
wait run that back , 
and we couldn't run it back 
wasn't that good . 
and we thought we were being very quiet , 
and i'm sorry .
oh , no . 
we're just not real big movie goers . 
well , i like to watch the movies , 
but it's gotten so expensive that we 
well , that's us too 
 and we rent them 
 and now we did go see home alone at the dollar movie 
and that was just hilarious , 
i died . 
i thought that was cute , too . 
and we did also , 
we went to see what about bob one night , which is a funny , funny movie 
and my husband's name is bob 
and he wants to see that 
it's a funny movie . 
he wanted to see that . 
i thought the funny part in home alone uh , that's good for kids , is kind of coming up with how they can deal with problems on their own without panicking 
that's true . 
 and i thought they could learn a lot of lessons from that . 
the little guy is so cute , 
and he's terribly rich by now . 
i hope he stays cute 
me too .
you get to where 
oh , that's right . 
that's right . 
they grow up too fast , 
but , uh , there's a lot i want to see , you know , 
what i try to do when they come out is just make a list of them that look good 
that's right . 
you know , i'd like to see green card , 
i want to see awakening . 
awakening , is supposed to be wonderful . 
 uh , i'd like to see silence of the lambs . 
my mom saw that 
and see , i've had somebody tell me that regarding henry , you know , the harrison 
i'd like to see that . 
i think that's supposed to be good , 
i've heard that's 
so i think there's a bunch of good movies coming out . 
my kids want to see rescuer's down under 
 so i'm going to ha , 
my v c r went on the blitz about two weeks ago , 
so i'm getting it fixed right now 
oh , dear . 
well , on , uh , 
back to your movie you saw that ten thousand , 
uh , hundred and one dalmatians 
 um , did you all ever think about purchasing that one , when it comes out ? 
you know , i look at those , 
like cinderella came out 
now i will copy them and rent them 
 but i just have a problem paying twenty five dollars for a movie that i can go down and rent for a dollar .
well , i understand that , too , 
now they had 
you know , they don't last that long . 
they had home alone offered for like , 
i think with the rebate you could get it for nine dollars 
oh , that's pretty good , 
 and i thought well , now that's close enough to being several , you know , 
you could rent it 
that makes it worth it , uh , 
but , a lot of the disney movies , it's just too expensive , 
and i can rent them 
well , i understand 
 or i can make a copy 
my daughter's in love with the little mermaid 
oh , yeah , 
of course . 
 and i have a copy that's just about worn out . 
she's four 
 so she just thinks the grou , 
oh , sweet .
now , i'm not pregnant , mind you , 
but this is , 
 but that's ,
she's planning ahead , 
well , it's hard to find a movie any more these days that you can take your kids 
 and even the ones that we rent at home , the trouble with some of them i know , 
we rented adventures in babysitting 
oh , i know . 
and it's a precious movie , 
but the language in it is just for no reason , has to stick in , 
now , see , i remember thinking it's a wonderful movie , 
but it's been so long since i 
i don't remember the language . 
well , you watch ,
was it bad ? 
well , that's true . 
 and i was just sitting there going , oh , my goodness , 
and i'm going to have to stop and explain , 
oh , and see my kids weren't in the roo , 
you're right , 
i watched it without them . 
it's a little different , because you see things from a different 
uh , we rented , 
this summer before we went on vacation , 
we rented chevy chase and that family vacation . 
and those are just absolutely hilarious 
 but you just really can't watch a lot of that . 
we had to fast forward through a whole lot of it for them to see it .
some of it just isn't , 
well , uh , some of the books i've read lately have to do with crafty type things where i've , um , learned things that i'm going to do for my children for christmas 
 and they were really , uh , helpful , because i didn't know how to do this one stitching , 
and so , that was very helpful to me as far as books . 
otherwise , um , i like to read children's books , and things like that . 
what about you ? 
oh , goodness , 
well i was an english major , 
so i like to read period . 
uh , lately , i've been , on the whole , very practical , 
and , uh , i'm trying , um , to , uh , furnish a home 
 so i've been looking at books on , uh , antiques and paintings and , uh , interior decoration hints 
so i've been doing very little reading , except i did finally dip into a couple of biographies . um , all of sort of literary figures of this century . 
it's interesting that you said that . 
my husband and i had , uh , took a book out of the library about gardening , too , and started a garden , a fall garden . 
good for you . 
i haven't gotten around to that . 
oh ,  , yeah , 
and and , um , peppers and tomatoes are on right now , 
so it's been really fun , 
and we learned that , you know , um , some of the gardening skills we had were before , 
but , some of them we learned from a book 
 and so that was helpful to us . 
now , i've read two books  , uh , that were , uh , nonfiction lately 
 and , uh , i , 
well , one was nonfiction and one was fiction , 
and the fiction one , uh , was about a boy uh , during the time of adolf hitler 
 and he grew up and lived through a concentration camp 
 and that was not enjoyment .
a real eye opener , uh , 
and i guess it's good to read those things , too . uh , 
but , i didn't enjoy it necessarily 
 and , uh , the other one was quite enjoyable . 
it was , uh , about what happened to her family through the years 
 so , that one was good . 
i think all of , 
well , even if they're not enjoyable , they bring you of learning , 
so even if it's the country that they're from or anything like that . 
so , the children's books , 
i think that's the most animated and imaginative . 
so i like those a lot . 
uh , what are your favorite children's books ? 
oh , there are a couple of newberry award winners . 
uh , a wrinkle in time is one 
i don't know if you've ever read that 
 but , um , oh , there's one about an indian girl , 
and i can't think of that , 
island of the blue dolphins is another 
 and that's a good one . 
now , some of the ones that have just received the awards this year , i haven't read , 
and i would like to read those 
 but , uh , it's funny , because i've read some from like nineteen twentythree and nineteen fortyfive and things like that 
 and i didn't enjoy those as much , 
and i don't know if it's just because they didn't come from my era or what , 
but , uh , 
that's interesting , 
well , you can't be an english major unless you like reading things from the past , 
so , i've read a great deal of old things . 
i tend to go back , 
i don't have any children 
 so i don't read the new ones , 
but i occasionally , if no one's looking 
even that's good . 
uh , my children and uh , i started a thing where i read a book with them before they went 
and there was one called the pig princess , 
and it was a princess from a long , long , time ago , 
and she came through a spell kind of thing and ended up in a pig , um , sty , 
and the people that she came to were just farm people 
 and she didn't understand them , 
and they didn't understand her , 
but it came together in this book , 
and it was really a lot of fun . 
i think that , uh , we , 
i'm wondering what camping means to you . 
when i think of camping i think and tents , uh , like along the appalachian trail . 
oh , very good . 
that's sort of the same thing that i do . 
i don't think of , um , trailers and campers and all this stuff . 
um , do you do much camping ? 
oh , you've never been camping . 
oh , gee . 
do you do much ? 
well , um , yes and no , 
and , the , uh , 
i haven't done much recently , 
but , um , up until , gee , maybe five or six years ago , i did a lot of it 
 and , you know i've , 
where you live now , 
no , um , 
and so , i camped a lot in , um , the middle east 
oh , okay . 
 and i was able to camp right in ruins , which was always very exciting 
oh , i bet . 
oh , okay . 
well , my and his uncle especially , uh , grew up camping together , 
and , uh , they just love it , 
and they're planning a trip , uh , into canada i guess in about a year , 
and they're going to spend about a week and a half camping up there , 
and you're not going ? 
so they're really looking forward to that 
oh , gee . 
i guess it makes a difference . 
i grew up camping , being in girl scouts and things like that , 
and see i was never exposed to it 
city mouse to try doing it .
i think you know , there's certainly a lot of aspects you would like , 
but maybe not you know the canada men's trip , but some other , you know , 
a nice tent on the shore of a lake , 
what's the best part about it the quiet , the getting away ? 
the no telephone , the , 
gee whiz , you go to bed when it gets dark , 
and you get up when it gets light .
and , um , i guess just the change ,
now , like do you usually go and there's lots of other people around , 
or is it pretty much isolated . 
and to me , i like that , i guess , too , although there are people , 
i mean , you know , it's really hard to get away 
 and i guess in the middle east , of course it was with a group , in order to make it safe 
 but , i mean , we'd go in different parts of the ruins , and things like that . 
but we didn't even have tents there , 
that does sound neat , 
but i don't think i've got quite enough nerve to do that . 
i know my husband's gone , uh , for several days on the appalachian trail before , 
and he said that a lot of times you can go for , you know , a good day before you'll see or meet anybody else on the trail . 
so it's not for the faint of heart , i don't think . 
actually i just joined , um , the appalachian trail walking club , or whatever they call it , 
i love to walk 
 and , um , i'm going to start with day trips , though , because i don't know the territory and all , 
and i'm not sure , 
my son is not eager to go 
i think it would be , 
well , that sounds really neat . 
oh , but , you know , i'm going to try .
i hope you get into camping some day , just slowly . 
we talk about sometimes going up to chincoteague 
oh , yeah . 
 and , uh , i , 
i think that , you know , 
i guess one time recently we went up to maine , and had planned to camp , 
and you know , the only site left when we got there was in the middle of a field , 
and i said , gee whiz , for twenty dollars we can go down the road and get a motel 
and , so that , you know , 
if the setting was right and it's great , 
but if it's , 
well , i've been um , thinking i'd love to buy a new car ,
but we have two cars right now 
and we're still paying on them , 
but i would love to have one of these new mini vans . 
i've got two little ones 
and i think that would be just the perfect family car .
right now my car is terminally ill 
 so i am really uh , facing the purchase of a car . 
uh , what i would like to have is so totally impractical for me that ,
but  , 
what is it ? 
uh , well , i would like for one time in my life to have a convertible . 
and , uh , you know , i don't even like the wind blowing in on me 
so i don't know why i think i want one 
but i do . 
uh , i will probably stay with a foreign make . 
i've had real good luck with them . 
um , we have , 
we went out to buy an american car 
so we bought , um , a chevy nova about three years ago . 
the hood 
is that right ? 
well , the chevy nova is the same car as the toyota camry . 
uh , at that time was the same car 
so they just put different names on them depending on who they're being shipped to . 
i thought that was pretty n , 
well , i didn't realize it . 
i knew had a plant over here . 
but i , i never thought of , 
i know , uh , 
you think it's a chevrolet in the good old u s a . 
that's why we were so surprised to see toyota i mean , imprinted on the engine . 
it was real interesting . 
but , uh , i , 
with so many options now available , you know , there's almost too much of a choice anymore . 
you know , there's so many different options and so many different prices and who has this cash back and whatever . 
i think that if i were really serious about looking for another car , i would take into consideration the price naturally . 
but , um , or whatever . 
well , yeah , 
and that's minimum . 
oh , yea , 
you know it's , 
what we used to pay for homes is now what a car ,
i cannot somebody , 
i heard a commercial or something about a sixty thousand dollar car about , oh , how ,
and i thought , i don't think i'd find that exciting .
i'd be wondering , you know , here i am buying this expensive of a car and my house isn't worth that much money .
if they held their value , that would be one thing . 
that's true . 
but when you consider that when you drive them off of the show lot ,
and , you know , that , 
i don't know that ,
i've bought a new car the last three that i've bought 
and i don't know that i'll buy a brand new one again . 
well , we had a pretty , 
we bought our chevrolet brand new 
and then we bought a used car .
just a minute , 
i'll change your diaper . 
then we bought our next car used 
and , uh , we had better luck with our used car , 
and i like it more . 
it cost us less money 
and we got more features and airconditioning and whatever on it then we did on our brand new one for twice as much money . 
well , i'm seriously considering going that route instead of a brand new car . 
if you can find one that's uh , you know , reliable .
if you can get someone that you trust to buy one from 
uh , i wouldn't .
and they don't drive them that much . 
sh  , 
six thousand is just getting broken in for them . 
and if i can find one or a repossession . 
we bought one like that . 
and with the banks being in such financial , you know , problems now that people , 
you can find the banks willing to sell you a car . 
we bought one car that way 
and had , 
we bought it real reasonably 
and it was in real nice condition because apparently whatever the bank get  . . . 
and a very good afternoon to you . 
do you , uh , do most of your cooking at home 
or do you , uh , have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them ? 
 um , no . 
and , um , i could safely say that i have never cooked for a dinner party . 
my goodness .
well , what would you , uh , like to cook ? 
what is your favorite , uh , recipes , uh , that you would like to have 
i'm in dallas . 
of course , um , dinner parties down here probably , oh , turn out to be more things like barbecues .
i was thinking in terms of mexican almost ,
uh , texmex , uh , 
mexican food , um 
well , that's a very interesting food though 
and when i go out to eat dinner sometimes 
we have , uh , 
i think som , chico's 
or in these different restaurants 
but , um , if i were to cook , uh , a dinner party , uh , it may be standard to you 
but , uh , actually i never get too much fried chicken . 
fried chicken . 
and i love twice cooked potatoes . 
 oh , yes , 
and , uh , i like broccoli casseroles 
as you can see , i'm inclined towards the mexican type of a meal .
and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too . 
so , uh , how would you improve upon that ? 
oh , improve upon that ? 
let's see . 
i'd probably put a bunch of fresh vegetables in . 
and some , 
more fresh vegetables ? 
included to that ? 
uh , green beans and , uh 
how do you cook your green beans ? 
my green beans ? 
um , i just get fresh green beans from the grocery store and snap off the ends and put them in water and steam them for about ten minutes . 
so you h , 
and i like to put a little mrs dash in with them . 
all right that's what i was wondering about . 
um , i like to just put a  tablespoon  or so of mrs dash in there . 
and it makes them pretty tasty . 
have you ever tried chinese type green beans ? 
the chinese type . 
are they the real , 
we use soy sauce , 
well , you might , uh , be interested in that . 
it gives a very delicious taste . 
you have a soy sauce taste 
and you also have a little cream sauce in there because 
uh , golly . what's this white powder uh , that you mix with water 
a white powder . 
i can't even think of the name of that right at the moment . 
um , gosh . 
anyhow  , 
sorry about my mind . 
that's okay . 
but , uh , it does make a nice thick creamy sauce with the green beans 
 and then you have a nice soy sauce taste under it with a few onions in there with it . 
if it does 
i like it to try them differently . 
so you might , uh , think about that . 
i might try that . 
chinese cooking actually has a lot of very delicious tastes to them . 
oh , yes . 
i love chinese . 
and , uh , north african cooking is good 
north african ? 
and that's , uh , made from , uh ,   i think they call it , beans . 
and that's the type of something that whatever you mix with it this couscous , uh , absorbs the taste of whatever else you put in it where that makes a very delicious dish . 
you probably have to buy that from specialty stores . 
c o u s , c o u s . 
and that's a north african dish . 
they eat it one to two meals everyday 
and it is very very flexible . 
you can do a lot of things with it . 
it makes a fantastic , uh , uh , salad with cucumbers and ,
oh , boy , 
real tasty . 
well , i've enjoyed talking with you , 
and i hope i've 
 and , uh , that's one thing we can enjoy is good delicious food . 
oh , yes . 
 well , thank you very much miss diane . 
when do  you , 
are you reading the papers about the middle east summit ? 
i'm just a little bit too . 
worn out from middle east after the war . 
i think uh , it didn't really take over the first page quite as much as it did i think during the war . 
but , um , we definitely need something there with all the hostages and 
that's i think , uh , 
i don't know in the short run it would be really nice to get the hostages all back . 
i think that's really , uh , really important . 
but i think they just have a whole different world than we do 
so , i don't know . 
but i don't know what do you think some of the long term repercussions might be ? 
 well , you know , i just see this middle east situation with russia and everything there that's happened i think that that crisis has kind of slowed down , 
and i see the middle east as being , you know 
so , i guess i view it as being the prime importance as far as 
i think , um , 
i don't know i guess . 
you know should we 
should we , uh , 
 i wish those countries could have the same type of freedoms or whatever that we do . 
i guess that's what i hope for them . 
but some of them don't want those freedoms i think . 
um , may not , you know , 
they may not want it as a whole 
so i think that's something that has to be considered too . 
but i think that's really a long term type thing . 
i know that the , 
and i was just thinking , well , peace is peace 
and that really is the nicest thing . 
i guess the question in my mind somewhat 
and it depends on the country , you know , 
i think some are more peaceful than others . 
if you look at , um , iraq for example 
i think , you know , we should have got him while we could 
i think so . 
i think , um , 
and i think there's a certain mentality 
i think they realized we would probably never push him out 
and , uh , i think the other , 
probably all of the other arab countries said that we were sort of wimpy for not forcing him out . 
i think they look at force as a way of 
you know , i don't know so much if these peace talks are going to , 
i don't know how much they'll stay to them . 
you know , even if we say that we're going to do stuff , i don't know how they'll stick to that .
the u s ideas or whatever used to probably receive money from the soviet union . 
and i guess that's all gone . 
i think that's really , uh , probably what started the whole process . 
well , that's probably a bonus on our part . 
it is . 
they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support 
we can either act like we're going to be procommunist or act like we're going to be uh , prodemocracy 
and whatever gets us the most  honor  that's what we'll act like we're going to do , 
but we really won't change in the long run . 
i think that's the way i sort of see them all working , you know . 
i tend to agree with you . 
you know , i think they have in mind what they want to do 
and i think a lot of times their    might make right  .
and , you know it , 
kind of the forceful , you know , 
i don't know . 
but i just don't think peace is uppermost in their minds .
it's really funny as an american and always being an ally with the israelis . 
i always find it very hard in my heart to align with the israelis because they seem to be just as bad as the arabs , you know . 
but then again they have to live in that environment . 
they have to be subjected to all of the arab bombings ,
then they have to negotiate almost everything 
and then you think to yourself , well , you know in your heart you don't want to be aligned with somebody that's mean and cruel to someone else , 
but if that's the environment that they have to live in and survive in , then you have to sort of 
like , i don't know , 
well , yes , 
not a good one , 
but i am a golfer . 
well , that's about the way i am . 
i don't consider myself a good one , 
but i do enjoy it . 
i , uh , haven't been out all year . 
i didn't get out this year , 
but , uh , i enjoy both watching it and playing it . 
i usually play a couple of times a month . 
sometimes more , 
but lately it's been just about that . 
but , i do enjoy , 
i think one of the things i enjoy the most is the beauty of the golf courses . 
and , the peacefulness . 
you can get out there , 
and the little critters that are around . 
that's really neat . 
you can just get out there and lose yourself in it and forget everything else in the world except what you're seeing out there . 
that's right 
and it's such a personal challenge . 
it really is . 
more than competitiveness against someone else . 
it's a competitiveness against yourself . 
 and , you know , it's so frustrating , 
i keep wondering sometimes why do i do this because it's so frustrating . 
you think you do pretty good one day 
and you're doing a whole lot better , you know , 
and then all of a sudden you go back out 
and it's just terrible . 
well , you'll , 
you can't do anything ,
or you'll hear thirty and think , boy 
i've had a par and a birdie ,
and then you quadruple bogey .
i don't , 
i guess i could . 
i , uh , watch them on t v a lot . 
you really should go at least once . 
you know , we've 
uh , tulsa 
and i've been to both of them 
and  , it is so much fun to 
i mean , it's like a bullet going by . 
i'll bet , um . 
and , you know , how friendly they are when they're , walk by you , you know , and 
well , i've only been playing like about three years now . 
my husband's played for twentyfive . 
but , i just took it up about three years ago 
and , uh , we play in a lot of couple's scramble tournaments . 
we belong to a country club a little ways outside of dallas , 
and , you know , it's fun to go on vacations and things and go to golf courses . 
it is . 
you can meet some really neat people . 
the scrambles are fun . 
they really are . 
i just love them . 
i belong to the country club there in el reno when i lived there 
on those , you really go out for fun . 
that's right . 
and , you know , you won't , 
you know you're stroke is just one of one or two or three 
that's right . 
and you just do your own thing and be relaxed and enjoy it .
that's right . 
when i worked at kerr mcgee , i used to play in their tournaments . 
and , uh , now that was very competitive . 
and , i enjoyed it tremendously , 
but , uh , i think i get more enjoyment just couple friends going out . 
and if it takes one of us ten shots to get up to the green , so be it . 
you know , we just think , well , the next time has got to be better .
i have never played in any tournament except just a scramble . 
they have a lot of them there at the club , you know , 
they have a b c d type tournaments 
and then they have the club championships and everything with the women's slots as well , 
but , i don't know , 
i've just never really gotten into that . 
now , my husband and all the men , i mean , they love the real competitiveness of playing for money , you know . 
oh , yes , 
every hole . 
but i'm not good enough for that .
does your club have a good woman's association ? 
i don't do much with it since , uh , most of theirs , 
they have a traveling league , 
and , uh , most of their meetings and all are during the week 
and i don't get to play except on the weekend . 
i work during the week all the time . 
it's hard to be a weekend golfer and improve your game . 
someday when i get where i live closer to the club and partially retired , maybe i'll , uh , be able to play a little more 
it's a good game . 
uh , i wish i had more time to play 
and i felt , you know , had more energy to play it , too . 
my children are all grown up . 
well , now see , i've got two children 
and , uh , they're , 
one is uh , just turned to be a teenager 
and the other one is on his way , 
 uh , i'm a single parent , 
so i think it makes it more difficult for me to , uh , you know , find time with my children since i 
i'll bet . 
and then , of course , take care of the house and all this good kind of stuff . 
uh , so uh , it's a real problem for me . 
i'll bet it is . 
what is the favorite thing you do with your children ? 
uh , the thing that we like to do the most is to watch t v together . 
and , uh , the kids like to play nintendo , 
but i'm no good at it , 
 so i don't like to play . 
you just watch them play , huh ? 
i tried it once or twice , 
but i didn't feel like i was very good at it either . 
me either . 
my grandson got me to one day , 
they talk about these different levels and stuff 
and i've never got off of level one .
different worlds 
 and how do you get to another world , you know ? 
and i don't even know what they're talking about . 
i know , 
i agree with you , 
the other thing i think we like to go to the movies , too . 
do you ? 
that's a neat thing . 
so i guess we're all uh , you know , movie , uh , fanatics or whatever around here . 
so we like to do those kind of things . 
i know when our kids were growing up , we were big into water sports . 
we had a boat 
and they all skied 
and in the summer we spent most weekends on the lake with them skiing 
and they always took other friends with them 
and we had a lot of fun doing that , 
oh , how neat . 
 so we didn't do too much sports wise . 
i find my grandchildren are very involved in soccer and baseball 
oh , yeah . 
see , i have a son 
and , uh , you know , it's football in the fall and baseball in the spring 
i'm constantly going back and forth . 
i'll bet you really are . 
and my daughter has , uh , tennis , 
so it's between tennis and bowling . 
i bowl 
so , you know , we're pretty active as a sports , you know 
well , when mine were real little , they all played soccer 
and then they got more interested in other things , 
i'm not sure that they would admit it at that age , that it was boys , 
but i think that's probably what it was . 
oh , yeah . 
the sports and everything , uh , yeah she likes to watch the football for , uh , the kids .
i'm sorry . 
uh , that was a cat that hit the telephone . 
get away , cat , 
but , uh , yeah , 
starting to grow up , you know . 
it's not going to be too many more years before uh , uh , you know , they'll be gone 
and , uh , there won't be as many activities . 
do you , uh , 
but they , 
but you enjoy them , 
i think , the older mine get , the more i enjoy them . 
i agree with you . 
i do . 
i'm so glad they're out of real young 
and the babies , 
and , i mean , i didn't , 
it wasn't that i didn't like them 
but the older they got , i enjoyed them as teenagers . 
and now that they're each , 
of course three girls , they've all become women in themselves that it's been neat to watch them . 
what kind of mothers they are , 
what kind of 
oh , yeah . 
that's so true . 
how they do things 
well , do your daughters live close where you can go out ? 
oh , good . 
so we spend a lot , 
oh , yeah , 
and we play with the kids , you know . 
but , uh , 
where d , oh , 
we go camp out , 
they camp out 
 and we spend weekends in the country with them 
that's true . 
 it's too much effort to go somewhere with all the kids . 
oh , yes , 
oh , yes . 
boy , i know , especially when they grow up like that , 
so these last five or six years , i'm trying to make them really special and 
they'll always remember it , too . 
i think so , too . 
i need to take my boys to do this or that , you know . 
there we go . 
i know they can't wait .
they just really can't wait to be able to take their kids where they had fun . 
that's right , 
so well , i still got a few more years , 
so uh , i'm hanging onto those and doing as much activity as i can with them . 
do you work ? 
and i work full time , 
so , uh , it , 
that cuts into our free time right there . 
it really does . 
the time you have with them has to be quality time then . 
that's right , 
and , uh , vacations are very special for us , and activities . 
i imagine that they have , uh , a lot of homework , too . 
you know , this being a school night and stuff , 
so , uh , and , uh , the other activities that we all have . 
well , there's just so many things to do with them nowadays , though , 
and especially if they're active kids . 
like you say you bowl . 
do you know 
i don't know what to think . 
i , uh , 
the person i am i want to believe that it's an honest effort . 
i want to believe that maybe they are headed for a more democratic society 
and i want to believe it's all okay . 
but then there's that side of me that says , yeah , 
do i be openminded and give them the benefit of the doubt which is kind of my basic personality . 
you know i , 
or do i keep on going , well , we'll wait and see .
well , i think there's a struggle within the soviet union . 
um , i think the people are just fed up , 
and i think it's showing 
and all the republic is trying to gain their independence , 
that's it's not just a it doesn't work . 
we believe this , 
that's right . 
i think , 
i guess i keep that one part of me that's like , 
well , i don't know i want to trust them 
and i , 
it's like i can't , 
and maybe it's because , you know , we've had our own propaganda over the years , 
i don't know . 
well , that could be . 
you know what i , 
we think of the k g b and we think such bad things , you know . 
but i wouldn't doubt if the soviet people think c i a and they think such bad things , you know . 
and they probably do the same things . 
they do . 
you think the c i a doesn't spy ? 
i'm sure they do . 
oh , yeah , 
now the difference is i don't think we take people and kill them just because they don't believe what we believe . 
you know , i think to that extent we don't go as far 
but i'm sure they lie . you know ? 
oh , yeah . 
oh , absolutely . 
that's part of that propaganda thing , 
and i think if we can get away from that , or if we can keep that out of our minds , oh , 
excuse me , i've got a cold today . 
that's all right . 
thank you . 
um , i think if we can get that propaganda thing because i'm sure both countries are you know , thinking k g b and c i a and all that 
but , uh 
that's true . 
 and i'm not against them being concerned 
but i feel like we ought to be spending maybe the same time and effort and energy into trying to solve our own or resolve our own . 
you know , i mean , you know , i understand that , you know , you are looking at the united states as the biggest and longest supporter of that type of government . 
but at the same time i agree . 
i don't think we can do it or be ignorant per se to the things that are happening here . 
that's right . 
you know , uh , that i feel we ought to be concentrating more on . 
i think the problem is , you know , 
on the international scope maybe the president feels that , uh , you know , for longterm relations with all these countries it's important 
and well , we'll always have the united states . 
and , you know , we need to solve these international problems 
but , um , i think i heard in the news about last week sometime that , uh , the president ended up canceling one of his international trips so he could spend more time on a domestic issue because the american public is kind of getting fed up with it . 
we believe in what he's doing abroad 
i am encouraged by what is happening in the soviet union . 
i'm encouraged by what's happened in , you know , the iron curtain countries , you know , 
and i think it's moved in the right direction . 
i think sometimes people expect it to happen overnight . 
you know , it's not going to . 
it didn't happen here overnight , 
that's right . 
that's right . 
and think sometimes we forget that . 
but you know , i'm encouraged by the way it's going . uh , 
so i'd like to know , um , what do you do in lawn and garden , 
what's of interest to you 
and how do you go about it ? 
well , i have a town home , 
so i don't do a lot of regular maintenance , 
but i do have a large garden out in back , 
so we do a lot of things with perennials and , uh , also a few annual plants , uh , 
and then every year i grow a garden . 
oh , you do actually , uh , grow a garden to produce food ? 
so how much room do you have ? 
um , we have virtually no room out in front , 
and then in the back i'd say we have about an eighth of an acre 
 and we pretty much fill it up with , uh , like i said , perennials , things that don't have to fool with every year , 
but then i've got , uh , a twentyfive by twenty area that i do gardening , as far as , you know , tomatoes and cucumbers and beans 
oh , that's what i was curious about , 
i was wondering whether you had actually some of the flowers that you had planted were bulb type that you would dig up and then put down your garden and then put them back in later , or something like that . 
so you . 
you do have a separate area . 
and last year was the first year we tried two new things . 
we tried corn , 
well , tell me this , uh , lowell , 
do you enjoy doing that kind of work , 
i don't think that if i , 
the reason i bought a townhouse is so that i wouldn't , 
i get , 
i'm allergic to grass . 
so i don't mow grass or anything like that . 
so i think if i had a big home and a big lawn i don't believe i would enjoy it . 
well , i'm a little more fortunate i think from that point of view . 
i'm not allergic to things , 
and i moved here in state college quite a while ago and was fortunate to get some land . 
so , actually i have nine acres .
oh , wow . 
and , uh , for many years i grew sweet corn , 
uh , and my kids were there , 
and so we set up a shop there , 
and , uh , i would , uh , collect the corn very carefully , ear by ear , 
and it was never more than one to two hours old , 
and people came from miles and miles around to get that corn , because they knew it was individually picked and very , very fresh . 
how about that . 
so we had a nice thing going there , 
and it was delicious . 
huh , i really enjoyed that , 
and then i also have a garden . 
oh , it's probably , uh , twentyfive by thirty or forty , something like that , that i put in my normal food garden things each year , 
and , uh , i have or a whole lot of everything in the 
actually . i love , uh , broccoli , brussels sprouts , 
and i have all kinds of tomatoes , kale , and all those good things , 
and i rent out my field that i used to plant in sweet corn to a local farmer , 
and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use , 
so i get out of that amount of work at any rate . 
well , that's nice . 
it is very , very nice . 
i really enjoy it . 
my problem is not having enough time to do the job as completely and as thoroughly as i would like . 
i enjoy it very much . 
that much land requires an awful lot of time . 
it does . 
uh , and actually i had a pony there for twentyfive years , 
and he had two acres that he had for his own grazing .
how about that . 
so he had his own backyard garden , too . 
but that worked out very nicely too . 
i built him a barn back there in the part of my corn field , 
and he lived in that , 
but , uh , as far as gardening is concerned , we do enjoy it . 
my wife is in charge of the flowers . 
she does all of the flower gardening throughout the whole property , 
and we have , you know , an acre and a half that the house is sitting in the middle of , 
and she has flower gardens and bulbs , perennials and things . 
we have blueberries , blackberries . 
i have two or three , uh , apple trees , 
the golden delicious were fantastic this year . 
my neighbor has pear trees , and , um , oh , blueberries , all kinds of food around there , if we just had time to take advantage of it . 
my wife has spent probably i don't know how many hours in the last two or three weeks canning pears , because there were so many of them , 
and i have been totally engulfed with golden delicious apples . 
i just couldn't handle the amount of them we got this year . 
it's really been a remarkable year . 
well , i bet you could answer a question for me . 
what's a good apple to bake pies with ? 
i use my golden delicious , 
and they make delicious pies . 
are there m 'n 
there's an afflu 
do you participate in family reunions ? 
i don't have enough family left to have them . 
did you , uh , 
were they far away , 
were they close ? 
well , i come from a family that was very large in bell county 
 and my grandfather came to bell county on a covered wagon 
oh , how neat . 
and so sometimes we would have a reunion with that group . 
and then , sometimes we would go to arkansas where they came from and have a reunion with the entire group , you know . 
oh , that would be fun . 
well , uh , we have a family reunion on my mother's side of the family that's , uh , oh , 
it started probably about forty years ago , uh , because i remember going as a teenager before i was ever married , 
and then my husband and i went , uh , while we were still dating , 
and it's still going on , 
and it used to be held at lake brownwood , down at brownwood , texas , 
but now we hold it at , uh , lake texoma so that the oklahoma group doesn't have to drive as far . 
and , uh , we have had as many on a saturday night , 
it starts on friday and goes through sunday , 
and we've had as many on a , uh , saturday night as about two hundred and fifty . 
um , now we would have group like that in arkansas . 
we'd have two hundred and fifty or three hundred . 
and we took , uh , 
our family all brought in food and everything . 
well , so many of us came from a long way that we'd usually at a motel 
and we bought food there . 
oh , uhhuh , 
well , i know on sundays we all elect now to chip in 
and we go get kentucky 
uh , but we kind of take our food for three days , 
and , uh , now our grandchildren are participating in it 
   enthused and with it 
and our children , you know , thoroughly enjoy it . 
so it's been kind of nice . 
it started out when i was a youngster and watching my mother . 
now i'm to the   mother was 
 and , uh , i am , uh , now the older generation and doing more of the cooking and watching my daughter 
and , uh . 
well , it's something i really miss , because i had twentyseven first cousins 
oh , my word . 
 and , you know , we were very close family , 
but our father's generation was enough older than i , 
my father would be a hundred now 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , in fact , many of my first cousins are dead 
oh , are they ? 
 and of course they have their own families and grandchildren and all that , 
so we really , very rarely all of us get together 
get together any more . 
 and we're a long way away , 
and the younger generation , the next like my cousin's children , i don't know very well , you know . 
but it , 
so it's , 
 i doubt that that will come to be again , 
but as long as my oldest aunt lived we , we got together once a year . 
i do think , now we have noticed a waning of interest , 
and as parents get older and start dying off , i think sometimes it is hard to keep the interest going . 
well , and folks have gotten so mobile , 
i mean , like i have a son and a daughter and two nephews that are grown 
but my brother and his wife live in nevada , my daughter lives in colorado , one of my nephews lives in new york city , one nephew lives in memphis 
but i think it's very unlikely we'll have a family reunion , you know . 
you probably do good just to get your immediate family together . 
and , i'm divorced , 
and really only immediate family i have left is my , 
i have a son and a daughter . 
but my family's really all dead . 
but it was great pleasure while we did it , you know . 
oh , yeah , 
they're a lot of fun . 
well , my si , 
i have a sister , 
and then we have a son and a daughter 
and we have three grandchildren 
 and our son and daughter are both married 
and , uh , our son's not as interested in it as our daughter , 
but our daughter is really interested . 
and , uh . 
does it bother you if your children are not interested in it ? 
i beg you pardon ? 
i wish that our son was 
than to our son's and just totally different ,
and plus , 
and he's newly married and doesn't have children 
 and , you know , i'm hoping ,
i know that . 
 well , what kinds of things do you do to try to get your children interested ? 
just talk to them about it ? 
now when he was a oh , preteen , you know , when he was like ten or twelve 
he had another cousin he was close to and went , 
but that cousin kind of quit going , 
and as he got to be a teenager , uh , he wasn't quite as interested . 
he was more interested in rock and roll , 
and this is more country western group 
 and , uh , just lack of interest , 
oh , really , 
have you been to any lately ? 
i was trying to think of the one i went to a couple of weeks ago , 
but i forgot it already . 
uh , i haven't really seen one since probably august because , uh , every weekend in the fall we go to our high school football game on friday 
and that's kind of the 
that's your weekend . 
but , oh , i saw , uh , robin hood , which i didn't care for . 
i didn't see that , because i didn't think i would care for it . 
and my husband dragged me to it . 
like , i think kevin costner's a nice fellow , 
and he's nice looking , 
but he just , to me , is not a very dynamic actor . 
i think that's why a lot of people go to see him , though .
i guess because he is good looking . 
i don't know .
i don't know .
i saw city slickers . 
did you see , 
that was a , 
that's the last one i saw , i think . 
 and i really enjoyed that . 
i did too . 
i thought that was so cute , 
i thought that was appropriate just for everyone . 
it was great . 
oh , i really enjoyed that . 
and my daughter went to see that one too . 
so , it was fine for her 
 so , yeah . 
which most of them probably aren't .
well that's right . 
i don't know what my kids see any more . 
my kids are twenty and sixteen , 
so they've probably seen about everything at this point .
probably they have . 
well , my daughter is twelve 
 and we had a sleep over one night . 
they wanted to watch pretty woman , which i have 
 and i was hesitant , 
and they all had seen it anyway . 
 oh , i know it . 
  all twelve , 
that's the way it is . 
they do 
there's no way to protect them any more . 
but i didn't think they were great for my daughter .
it'll teach a great lesson , because she ended 
but it was a fun movie to watch . 
oh , i love pretty woman , 
and then i like that one after that where , oh , 
what was it ? 
it was like a fatal attraction thing . 
oh , the scary one ? 
oh , i didn't see that , 
but the , 
i don't remember the name of it 
but that was so good . 
oh , really . 
that was really excellent . 
oh , i like scary ones that are realistic . 
that was . 
they say   is really frightening , too . 
what was ? 
   , the new one that came out . 
oh , i don't know . 
they say it's really horrifyingly scary 
 but , uh , i'd never get my husband to that . 
he doesn't like to be scared .
the last scary thing i saw was misery . 
oh , and my kids both saw that . 
they liked it . 
that scared me to death , 
and i watched it at a friend's house on video 
and i was just . 
oh , yes . 
it was horrible . 
it was so awful . 
oh , no , 
that one sounded gross , 
i know my husband wouldn't have stood for that . 
he likes mary poppins and things .
i like that , too . 
i like funny movies 
and i like scary movies . 
i do too , 
i really like a variety . 
where are you from ? 
i'm from new york . 
oh , i was going to s , 
well my husband's from new jersey , 
is he really . 
 and so , it sound kind of nice , 
it was familiar your accent . 
it's so close , 
i'm from long island 
 so that's close , you know , 
i don't know   up there . 
just , uh , 
i guess . 
well , see the accents up there fascinated me , because even in his family alone , there were several different accents 
and his family , they lived in the same house there , 
most of them were twenty or so you know . 
and they were all from new jersey . 
and they lived , you know , 
they never moved into apartments when they were young , 
they always stayed at home until they got married , 
it seemed to be the custom up there . 
or they went in the service , 
and so they were together for all that time .
but they still , 
their accents differed a little in the family 
 and it . 
when did you live there ? 
uh , in the sixties . 
oh , yeah . 
  i finally . 
i was in new york in the sixties . 
oh , yeah . 
i converted him to being a texan . 
i just thought life would be , 
i knew it was easier back here . 
are you from texas ? 
i'm an air force brat , 
oh , yeah , 
i went to college here and everything . 
oh , yeah . 
and i just thought , you know , we could probably get a better house , 
and life is a little slower , a little easier . 
it is , 
he loves it . 
he really , would never want to leave , 
so it worked out . 
i'm used to it now . 
so , i like . 
not hard when you first came . 
oh , yes 
oh , my . 
 and you can imagine what plano was like eighteen years ago . 
oh , i know , 
it was very difficult . 
oh , compared to new york , oh , 
i didn't even want to talk . 
were you all transferred ? 
i have a friend down the street's from new jersey 
and they were , 
he got a , 
what kind of books do you like best ? 
well , i alternate between danielle steele is one of my very favorites 
uh , then i try to go into one of the self improvement books . 
uh , we take books every once in a while in our sunday school class and go through them . 
uh , i love scott peck and his road less traveled . 
huh , yeah , 
i've heard of that one . 
oh , it is 
i thoroughly enjoyed that . 
what do you read ? 
well , uh , i'm a tom clancy fan . 
and i read , 
i just finished a book on novelle netware , uh , 
that's computer stuff . 
i do a lot 
oh , yes . 
and , uh , i'm just finishing another one up on , uh , statistical sampling , 
so , i do more work kind of related reading than , uh , just for enjoyment . 
i try to keep a book going all the time . 
uh , i try to read when i first wake up in the morning and then before i go to sleep . 
so i probably get , oh , thirty to fifty pages a day read . 
well , that's pretty good . 
and i just , you know , 
i don't feel like , 
in fact this morning , i was almost late for work because i'm almost at the end of this book 
and i didn't want to put it down .
 oh , i've had them like that before , too . 
but i like mysteries . 
mysteries . 
any particular writer ? 
uh , yes , 
i'm drawing a blank . 
uh , he wrote the , uh , bourne ultimatum . 
and , uh , i like jeffrey archer . 
he is an english author who writes some mystery . 
uh , well , i guess they're a type of mystery . 
they're usually some p , 
he's a exlawyer 
he's a lawyer who no longer practices , 
so , you kind of learn something as well as enjoy yourself . 
and then , uh , the new author that came out with , uh , oh , the one that , uh , harrison ford starred in . 
raiders of the lost ark stuff . 
it was 
it's late , 
i'm tired , 
so i'm not 
uh , it's nine thirty here . 
oh , uh , it was his first book . 
it was on the top of the list , uh , 
he was a d a . 
uh , presumed innocent ? 
oh , i haven't seen the movie , uh , or read the book 
and then he came out with the second one . 
uh , a sequel to it . 
and both of those i've enjoyed real well . 
but i like that . 
i love danielle steele 
and , you know , if i want to get a fantasy and 
is she 
just feel good . 
her books , uh , 
you always cry . 
oh , really ? 
i mean , it's always good for good tears . 
uh , one book that she wrote that's good for both men and women is fine things , 
my motherinlaw's a real fan of hers . 
it's always going to make you have a good cry 
and you know it's going it turn out good 
and you're going to be happy in the end .
oh , well , that's nice . 
and i said , you know , 
i don't want anything too real anymore . 
i have enough of that in my own life . 
i want happy , fantasy 
uh , you mentioned sunday school ladonna . 
uh , do you , 
are you a bible fan , too ? 
i certainly can't say that i understand a lot of it . 
oh , yeah , 
but , uh , that's always a challenge . 
so do you do , 
my wife talks with other people , 
oh , well . 
well , okay , 
uh , well , brian , 
well , first of all , 
real fine . 
uh , first of all , uh , yes , 
uh , i do own a p c here at home 
and i also have one at the office . 
and my level of interest is quite high with p c s 
and i am really interested in them , however , not to the extent as i was about , uh , two years ago when i basically knew about everything there was to know about different things 
and that was the time when we were shopping for one . 
and i think we got a top of the line at that time , 
but , uh , as you know p c s change quite rapidly 
and the technological advances kind of outdated our p c where i can get the same p c i got two years ago at the fraction of the cost . 
and i also enjoy using ours at home 
and we use it for a number of different things . 
plus i get in where i work . 
lot of , uh , analytical , uh , testing , reviews , uh , lot of different things i use it at work , 
so i enjoy p c s 
and life and my work a lot easier . 
how about yourself ? 
well , uh , since , uh , 
well , i guess since this time last year i've changed , uh , jobs within the firm i'm with 
 and , uh , i now am learning to be a sys admin uh , professional work stations 
all right . 
and these are the big mamas , i . e . sons , uh , hewlett packards , uh 
and , uh , h , 
and , uh , we have , uh , two p c s here . 
we have , uh , an x t 
and then recently command decision to go ahead and get , uh , the absolute top of the line because spouse is a , uh , programmer . 
and so we got one that , 
oh , yeah . 
oh , yes . 
 so , uh , i get to see all kinds of different applications . 
sounds like you're an expert at it , too . 
i'm learning to be , uh , one who knows what's he's doing 
 but , expert , 
oh , well , well . 
i frown on you know , uh , misuse the word 
but my level of expertise is increasing almost daily . 
well , that's great , be , 
and , uh , yeah , 
so , i've got a p c and a work station at work 
and i 
 and we have two p c s here at home . 
and the , 
a lot of the new mama we're , uh , 
i've got aldus and , uh , micrographics on it as far as , uh , technical publishing 
and we do quite a bit of church work with ours . 
and , uh , 
we do an awful lot of that , too with ours . 
you know , some , 
i've found that , uh , the more we do with it , uh , 
it seem , 
and the lord's just pleased that we're kind of , 
this is , part of giving back a portion of what he's given to us . 
so , uh , i don't mind , because seems like the more we do , there's the more stuff that's , uh , available that comes along and so forth . 
oh , yes . 
definitely agree with that . 
because the top of the line we've got , 
well , we've got a compatible . 
you got , 
that's a four eightysix processor , too ? 
like i said 
you have to have that to support unix . 
of ram . 
and then , uh , it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive . 
so the next size up was a two hundred and eleven 
and so rather than just have one , we went ahead and got two . 
uh , at some point in time i'm going to do the mirroring , uh , experiment to where one disk mirrors the other for 
and , uh , oh , speak of the angel , she just walked in .
well , good for her .
t i stuff .
so , uh , uh , 
you say she's a programmer also . 
well , great . 
well , she probably needs that kind of a powerful type of a machine to do her work . 
pardon me ? 
 well , there's , uh , 
and one that i think is quite fascinating because , uh , couple of years ago , i guess , uh , 
was in full swing . you know , 
you had the , the russians against the americans , the communists against the free world , 
and in the last couple of years things have changed dramatically , not only on the political front but also on the economic front , where , uh , couple of years ago uh , america was one of the leading powers and one of the strongest nations in the world as far as economics were concerned , 
and now we're having a very tough time in a recessionary period . 
we're also have a very humongous trade deficit , 
uh , and that's kind of frightening . 
also , you know , a couple of years ago , ten , fifteen years ago , an individual going into a career could expect to have that career basically throughout their whole life , 
and thirty years ago , four to five career changes throughout our lifetime , 
and so i think , uh , you know , things , 
there's been an awful lot of social change lately , 
and we , 
and , uh . 
i think one of the things that's interesting to me is if you look particularly at the political changes 
 so if you look at russia and what's happened over there , i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing . 
and , of course , i look at the economic problems in the united states right now . 
one of the things you wonder is what that's going to do to us . 
i think the other kind of changes like job changes and those kinds of things , i mean , i think it's great to even have three or four different careers 
i think it must have been terribly boring to go through , 
some of that opportunity for job change in the fact that aspects changing . 
and the uncertainty of whether you're going to have a job is not as good , 
but , the fact that you really can make major changes in your life 
i think it's great . 
you think that's great . 
oh , yeah . 
that's some , 
because a lot of people seem to stagnate once they get into position , 
they're very comfortable , 
they lose the ability to learn , 
and they in a sense become unteachable . 
they think they know all there is to know in the area , set path , and you know , come in and put my time in from nine to five , 
and when that's over with , that's it , without even giving a second thought to    , advancing their education or getting extracurricular , um , education , 
and i think that's an excellent opportunity for us to expand ourselves also . 
i think one of the problems with education as it relates to this , though , is that i don't know that education is prepared to help people make those changes . 
it just seems a lot of the training and education that goes on is gearing people towards a profession 
i agree with that , 
but i believe that , uh , an individual should really learn how to learn 
 learn how to adapt , 
learn how to grow in their college or whatever education they might take . 
well , that's good , 
there probably needs to be some training on how to adjust to these changes as they come about . 
i mean if you look at the high unemployment rate right now 
and you look at people who are in those situations , i don't know that they have good coping skills or a lot of them , even ideas of how to make those changes now . 
so it seems to me that while those changes are taking place , maybe we're not well preparing people to make the changes with them . 
i read a few articles off in the newspaper and some publications where stress , uh , for those people that are laid off and also for those people that are not laid off but were threatened with a layoff and threatened with a reduction in their company is extremely high right now . 
that stress is a very prominent factor in the work place 
and it affects , 
well , nancy , what do you think , um , some of the changes in roles of women are in american society in the past generation or two ? 
well , of course , working . 
that's definitely got to be the biggest thing , is that everybody's out there working 
well , what do you think it is ? 
um , yeah , 
i agree . 
i also think that there are more , um , 
the people are , 
women stay single longer it seems like . 
yes , they do . 
i know my mother and her sister were both married by the time they were twenty 
 and i waited until i was thirtytwo , 
you know , um , i know that . 
that's true . 
it's a big change . 
i'm an o b nurse 
and so i really do see what you're saying there . 
it used to be that our list ran nineteen , twenty , twentyone for our patients' ages . 
and now our care plans look more like thirtytwo , thirtythree 
so , yeah , 
you're right there's a big change , 
and we have a lot of first time moms in their late thirties and even forties . 
so , it's true . 
but again , i guess it probably does go back to the same thing of women having careers . 
if they didn't have , 
if they weren't out there working and having their careers 
seems like there's . 
i guess it's a combination . 
go ahead . 
go on . 
uh , it just seems like there are more single mothers , too . 
i mean , that's , 
there's a lot of mixed up families , that's for sure . 
i agree . 
well what do you think have been the most significant changes in the past generation or so ? 
well , just that . 
i think the families , 
the role in the family , 
and the mother doesn't stay home and cook the dinner 
we do it all .
i really think that , 
and i know that there's a lot more participation by the fathers , 
but i still think the mothers have the major role . 
i really do . 
i think they're not doing very much less , 
i don't think as far as the kids and the house and everything 
 and they're contributing to the income besides . 
i think that we're really putting a lot of stress on ourselves . 
and it's affecting the families 
i mean , i don't blame anybody when they have to work 
it's difficult , 
and i think that , 
i live in plano actually , 
it's a very wealthy town , 
and we're not part of that , 
but , it is , you know , 
and , i think what i see a lot of parents , a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better 
 and i really hate that 
i hate to see that , 
and i've been here for a very long time 
 but , um , i don't know , 
now i'm a single parent , 
and i don't have a choice any more 
 but i used to just work occasionally for extra money , 
but now i have to work all the time 
 and that's really hard 
and leave the kids . 
in a way it's very good to get out with adults , 
and i think that's a good thing , if you can do it 
but to just go out there forty hours a week , at least and 
i think that's 
well what do you think's going to happen in the next generation ? 
you think it'll continue ? 
well , it's going to be interesting . 
i think it will change , 
but i'm not sure how it's going to , because you see young people today and wonder how in the world they'll ever afford to buy a home and 
i don't know how they're going to do it . 
and so i don't know how it can change to where the mother can get back into the home again . 
i don't that ever will go backwards 
 but i don't know what effect it's going to have on these kids now when they grow up , how they're going to feel about it . 
you know , it could lead to another woodstock type thing , you know , where 
and maybe these kids will really resent that their parents are out there working for things 
it's hard to say . 
it is . 
i think some , 
i don't know will move back toward more traditional lifestyle of staying home with the children . 
i guess i see that happening already . 
some choosing it , 
and they get , you know , 
people chide them for it , you know , 
why aren't you out , 
i haven't been too many places .
you haven't been to too many places . 
i haven't . 
well , okay . 
i have been to hawaii . 
see now , that is where i want to go . 
that is where i have always wanted to go . 
i have never been there . 
it is beautiful . 
i know . 
is it , uh , 
i had an aunt that lived there 
and she couldn't stand it any more . 
she moved out because she said the whole island was , uh , you know being taken over by the japanese . 
well , there is a lot of japanese over there . 
and they are , 
and she , uh , also told me that , 
well not her , uh , necessarily , other people that have been there have said that it is too commercialized . 
is it ? 
uh , well , yeah . 
there is , 
it is commercialized . 
i don't think i have enough , 
oahu naturally has got more people on it than the other islands . 
but , it is still beautiful . 
you have got to see at least once . 
oh , well i will . you know , 
well , what is uh , you know the nicest island ? 
uh , i like maui . 
maui . 
i think that is what usually people , uh 
well , i like it because the beach is nice and white 
and you know it is like oahu , 
you can go over there and lay on the beach 
but , uh , kauai , 
i mean , the beaches are nice , 
but i don't know , just not nice as maui . 
and then , uh , where have you been ? 
 well , i have been to california . 
i've been to san francisco . 
oh you have ? 
i loved it . 
i absolutely loved it . 
and , uh , 
how long ago ? 
oh , uh , eightysix . 
my sister lives out there .
my sister lives in piedmont . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , well that is right near piedmont . 
that is like a suburb or something , whatever . 
oh , yeah . 
well she was in berkley also 
and she 
lets see i went when she uh , was living , 
well when i went out there she was in , uh , now i can't , oh , lafayette . 
she was living in lafayette . 
 oh yeah , 
and then they moved to piedmont . 
so uh , i haven't seen , uh , you know , her house in piedmont 
but i loved san francisco . 
i would like to go back . 
did you go on the cable cars and everything ? 
oh yeah . 
isn't that fun ? 
went to alcatraz . 
you know we did the whole bit . 
and then we went to the wine country . 
oh yeah . 
up by napa . 
oh , beautiful . 
and we went to carmel . 
and we took the eighteen mile drive . 
isn't that pretty . 
i love it down there . 
 oh , it is beautiful . 
my girlfriend was down there a few months ago . 
first time she has been down there 
and they wanted to take that drive 
and they had closed the whole road because of , uh , uh , fog , 
 oh , the weather . 
so they never got to do that . 
well i have also been to the carribean . 
oh , i haven't been there either .
you name it , i haven't been there .
well i , uh , have been there a couple of times . 
i went on a cruise . 
oh , that is nice . 
the last time i went , i went with my two sisters . 
 and it was over christmas time . 
and we really had a good time . 
well they had this cruise director dress up like santa claus , 
and we went to the beach 
and they had put a christmas tree on the beach 
it was a lot of fun . 
well , that's nice . 
is , uh , a cruise nicer than , uh , if you just go , uh , you know , to a hotel ? 
oh , yeah . 
it is . 
i have heard it is . 
because you don't have to worry about unpacking or anything like that you know . 
you put your clothes in your room , 
oh , you will have to go on one . 
you don't get seasick ? 
that is what i am afraid of . 
no , 
i mean there was , 
some people did , uh , on that last cruise that we took because they was having a storm come in 
 but that is unusual . 
uh , one of my sisters got sick , 
but the other one didn't 
but , uh , it is really nice 
and they just do so many things for you , you know , to make you enjoy the trip and everything . 
so , you will have to do that once . 
i want to go on another one , 
but i want to go to alaska . 
oh , yes . 
now someone i know was on a cruise to alaska . 
was it to alaska ? 
i am pretty sure . 
that is right my hairdresser .
oh , really ? 
she went last year . 
and i was thinking , you know , cruise i am thinking . 
so on 
and she is laying on the beach . 
and i said , well you are not very tan for someone who has been on a cruise .
and , uh , that i would like to go , 
well hawaii uh , is number one . 
i would also like to go to australia 
and get a , 
oh , i think i would like to , too . 
i keep hoping to win the lottery where i can do all these things . you know . 
oh , well see , i am just in the publisher's clearing house and the reader's digest , because we don't , uh , 
right now the lottery here , 
okay . well , what do you think about the government providing health insurance for everybody ? 
i think they should . 
i know i had a job until , let's see , a year ago this past december . 
i was working for p i e 
and they closed , 
 and naturally while i was working for them i had health insurance , 
but , um , for me to try to get it now , it would cost me like over three hundred dollars a month with the same company that was providing health insurance at p i e . 
good grief . 
it really is , 
and you know , i think , uh , 
god , the government should come up with some kind of a health plan , or stop these doctors and hospitals from having their prices so high . 
well , i wonder if they couldn't just provide , uh , interim health insurance for people who are between jobs like that . 
that might be a step in the right direction . 
i don't know . 
well , the thing is , you know , jobs are so hard to find 
anyhow in the valley where i live at now , they don't want to pay anything for health insurance at all . 
no benefits , you know . um . 
you mean the , uh , the employers ? 
i mean , you get a job now , and the wages are really low 
and , uh . 
because everybody's competing for jobs . 
and they don't want , uh , 
so you just , you know , pray to god that you don't get sick . 
well , i used to think that universal health insurance was probably the right thing to do . 
uh , actually he's canadian 
 and , uh , he told me that there're a uh , lot of counts against the canadian system , which is basically the one people are talking about for here . 
i don't understand the arguments , exactly . 
i'm not quite sure i understand why government health insurance would restrict your choice any more than private insurance does . 
i don't understand 
 i mean 
 actually i have my own business , 
our health insurance is through my wife's employer , 
uh , and every year we get another list of what doctor's we can go to , and where we can buy our medicine , 
and , uh , it changes every year .
it's always so confusing . 
well , i know the plan that i had with p i e , i could go to any doctor 
and i could go to any drug store and get my prescriptions filled , you know , 
then i just sent cards in 
 and then they would have like a ten dollar deductible per year for my medicine , 
well , yeah . 
of course , the restricted choice in this case is because only certain doctors agree to accept uh , the limits 
but of course that is restricted choice , 
i think it has to do with the , uh , attempt to limit cost , doesn't it 
 and everybody agrees that we need to limit cost some way , 
that's true , 
that's true there . 
you have to recognize that if you're going to have the very best health care possible and , uh , available on demand whenever and wherever you want it , then it's going to be expensive . 
and if you want to pay less , then you're going to have to settle for a health system that is not quite that , uh , lavish . 
and , uh . 
but there's just so many people that can't afford to pay anything , you know , 
people that's on unemployment . 
what happened to reagan's safety net , anyway ? 
i don't .
did he take that back to california with him ? 
using it for a trampoline now ? 
i don't know , 
but it does seem to be a big problem , you know . 
i don't know what they're going to come up with , 
but , um , i sure wish they would come up with something , 
and , uh , like i say , 
and i'm at the age , too , where the , 
i'll be fiftyseven in june , 
and the people don't want to hire people this age any more . 
 and i worked for my previous company for twentysix years , you know , 
so , you know , 
they'll be needing you in a couple of years , because they're running out of kids down the other end . 
they'll be calling at my door , huh . 
 but anyhow . 
 well , if they're smart . 
now you know , even to go to a little doctor out here , just to ask him anything , costs you forty bucks 
and then he , 
then that's not counting what medicine you're going to buy and everything else , you know . 
and he might tell you , well , you know , now you're going to have to come back in a week , 
as you think over the plans and so forth that the company you're working with now , 
who do you work with at this time ? 
well , i own the company . 
you own the company . 
all right . 
i'm the president and c e o of the company . 
my goodness . 
so , uh , i guess , uh , i determine what the benefits are .
i guess you do . 
uh , so what are you asking me , 
what benefits i think are most important ? 
well , what do you think of the , 
let's put it this way , 
what do you think are the most important benefits for those working for you , other than their present salary ? 
um , i'd say in today's economy , besides basic benefits , uh , such as , um , health insurance and life insurance and some type of retirement plan 
a profit sharing plan , 
that's interesting , 
they like to participate in the profits of the company like they're , you know , 
because they feel like , well , we're contributing to it , 
so we'd like to participate in it , 
and so that means i make a little bit less , 
but the thing is that really you make a little more , because everybody has a interest in it working . 
because  , they have a specific reason to do so , because they themselves benefit from doing a better job . 
i think most people , uh , don't want money , um , 
it's been my experience , most people want , uh , to feel like they're participating in something uh , that is not a drudgery , you know , that they 
and it's a contribution . 
well , bill , uh , that idea fits me exactly . 
i just retired from , uh , the university here , 
and that's been the goal in my life , was to contribute to the work that i was doing in my research , 
and that's what made me happy , 
and , uh , that's the type of goal i think most people ought to look for , 
and i'm sure a lot of them don't . 
you can't stand in front of a counter and do that kind of stuff all day and feel like that you're contributing something to a scientific level of knowledge or so forth . 
well , uh , our people get a lot of satisfaction . 
um , we're a financial planning firm . 
you're a financial planning firm ? 
how many , uh . 
you said you retired , 
i just happen to have a person that i happened to do some planning for this morning , 
 and , uh , it's real important , uh , that their benefit plans that they get from their companies and from their work where they were , that , uh , uh , that it take care of them . 
they don't , 
none of them really want to be rich , 
but they like to have enough to be comfortable . 
well , to your company , that might benefit the employees or perhaps the company itself better ? 
well , um , we , considering instead of tying a profit sharing plan to uh , that a person would participate and bring into the company . 
uh , pay them , uh , based on the percentage of business they bring , instead of based on their salary . 
 and the re , 
when you say bring in , do you mean that they negotiated with people to come in and , uh , ask for your support ? 
um , it can be inhouse people who help you handle x amount of dollars . 
 oh , okay . 
even though they didn't bring it in , they help it once it's there . 
and then we have financial planners , 
uh , then we have , uh , staff secretaries and administrative assistants , 
and these secretaries and administrative assistants , um , you know , if we don't have their cooperation and they're not participating in the profit of the company , they can get very dissatisfied very quickly . 
and , so , uh , we're thinking about paying them , instead of a percentage on salary , paying them a percentage on the business they handle . 
so administrative assistant that would handle two million dollars worth of business is a lot more valuable than a person that handles a hundred thousand dollars worth of business . 
 and , uh , 
but it might not be necessarily because he did a good or bad job , 
but it might be whether the locality there , those people want that kind of support . 
well , but to , 
i don't think any 
i think most people want to be , lack of better terminology , they want to be selfemployed , 
but they don't want to take the risk . 
in other words , they like to control their own future , 
but they also want to be somewhat content to go and come as they please 
that's true . 
that's what we have . 
actually , i'm in , 
like i said , i'm in minneapolis 
and the big thing up here , of course , is the twins . uh , 
i imagine you can't escape it .
it's pretty pervasive . 
it kind of goes into about all aspects of society i think up here . 
but , uh , actually , i don't know how much of the world series you caught last year , 
but that was a lot of fun   .
well , of course , it was fun for you .
 well , to be honest with you , i'm not from minneapolis . 
in fact , i've only been up here a few months 
and i'm going back at the end of next month . 
uh , orlando , florida . 
oh , really . 
so i'm not exactly a real twins fan from birth or anything . 
i was born and raised uh , near miami and , uh , spent the 
 oh , yeah . 
and , uh , for the 
uh , but honestly , you know , uh , i do my duty and watch the sports on , uh , 
oh , okay . 
 but that's about all the exposure i have to sports . 
i haven't followed it real closely at all . uh , except like i said , last year when the world series rolled around , i did follow that pretty religiously . 
went out into the bars , you know 
 but , uh , 
 well , i guess the , uh , san francisco giants and the oakland a s were like the leading teams a couple of years ago . 
is that right ? 
well , i th , 
well i don't know . 
that's sort of what i gather . 
um , and , uh , i don't know . 
what is the prognosis for , uh , this year ? 
uh , real good as far as i can tell . 
people are pretty excited about it . 
i assume that means good for the minnesota  , 
well yeah 
sorry about that , 
uh , as far as the twins are concerned , it seems to be real good . 
uh , my roommate went and saw them play on their season opener a couple of nights ago 
and they won that one seven to one , 
so , uh , that's pretty good i guess . 
it looks like they'll be doing pretty well . 
oh , okay . 
all right . 
well , i don't know . 
 uh , as far as the , uh , san francisco giants and the oakland a s 
but i think they both won their opener . 
i , uh , sort of gathered that in my , uh , subliminal memory . 
well maybe that uh , for their season coming up . 
i've actually got a friend that's living in san francisco right now . 
uh , he's doing the same thing i'm doing which is , basically , uh , an internship . 
we're both doctoral students 
and he's 
and i'm doing mine with honeywell . 
but , uh , i think he kind of follows the sports 
and i think he's mentioned uh , the oakland a s a couple of times . 
i guess they are different leagues . 
is that right ? 
the a s ? 
  yeah  .
 and in the major leagues , i guess there is a couple of different divisions 
and then , of course , there's the minors . 
uh , i don't know . 
i guess i'm one of those people that if i really made a concentrated effort , i could really probably get into baseball . 
uh , but i was talking to my roommate a couple of nights ago , right after that game , 
and he offered , you know , to take me to one of the games because , apparently , or a row of seats actually , for the home games . 
but the thing is , there's like eightysix home games per year . 
so there's no way that you can ever use them all . 
eightysix ? 
i was amazed to hear that . 
you know , that's just the home games 
and i thought it was a mistake 
 well they must play every day then . 
well just about , 
i mean eightysix times two 
and that's , you know , 
that's almost , 
 and lord , that's , uh , over five months worth . 
that's a lot of baseball . 
even if they play every day , that's over five months worth . 
well , if you consider it , the season starts , 
well it's , 
the season started about a week and a half ago 
and it ends with the world series which usually takes place , i believe , in december or january . 
it did last year , didn't it ? 
or was it november ? 
that was the super bowl . 
maybe it was november i'm thinking about . 
i know it was doggone cold up here . uh , 
i don't feel so bad . 
i think you don't know all that much more than i do about baseball .
 well , i know for sure it was , 
i see , 
 and it was at least two months after i got up here . 
oh , really , 
okay   .
 so it had to be november anyway . 
well , i know , uh , the super bowl , 
what would you rather have ? 
or you want salary too plus what ? 
what's most important to you ? 
well , as far as tangible benefits go i would say that , uh , health insurance of all forms is probably my next most important concern . 
i feel that a company that can provide good health benefits such as health care , dental and vision 
i think that is the most important thing .
uh , i'm not working right at the moment 
but the company that i did work for 
excuse me i had health benefits . you know , dental , vision , all that , pension plan , uh , 
now i don't have that , although i do have a pension that i'm drawing from them which , thank god , i had . 
but , uh , man , i think those medical benefits are the most important . uh , 
 you really don't realize how important they are until you find yourself on the other side of the fence without them and having to cover your own medical 
and , uh , you can quickly see where they become a very important part of your compensation package . 
uh , i should knock on wood . 
i haven't , you know , had any serious health problems or anything . 
i've only probably been to the doctor a couple of times since i left work 
and it was only for a cold , you know , 
and they can't really do anything for you anyhow , 
so you might as well not even go .
oh , you've got a cold . 
go home and take , uh , liquids and , uh , rest . 
uh , that is definitely , the most important . 
uh , pension , i guess , is next . 
uh , thank god that i had one . 
i don't know what happened to the salary employees when , uh , the company went bankrupt 
 but i was union , 
so mine was being put into like a trust fund , you know . 
but i don't know if they ever got anything or if they lost all of theirs 
i suspect that it just disappeared . 
that's what i was thinking too . 
i really feel sorry for all those people that spent all that time there , you know . 
so where , 
what company do you work for ? 
uh , i work for a little startup company here in pittsburgh called trans ark . uh , 
 um , uhhuh . 
have you heard of them ? 
we do , uh , distributive system software 
you probably heard of that .
 ah , yes , 
oh , does she really ? 
oh , how about that . 
so , yeah , 
i see , uh , 
after the merger , uh , you see a lot of ryder pie stuff on the road . 
well , you did . 
so , did ryder get out of the business ? 
is that what happened or ? 
well ryder and p i e went together 
and then that ended it .
so that the merger pretty much ended the whole thing . 
it really did . 
it started , i think , a little bit before that 
but that , 
when p i e and ryder went together , why that was downhill from then on , you know . 
and the problem with that is , you know , when you leave a job , you can continue your benefits for some  finite  period of time . 
but they're just cut off completely 
and you're responsible for your own . 
 and that's exceedingly expensive . 
it was over three hundred fifty dollars a month if we wanted to continue our own benefits . 
we could do that for eighteen months . 
it's definitely excessive . 
anyhow , uh , and jobs aren't that hard to find , to get another one that does pay your benefits , you know . 
 and a lot of them that , 
if you do get a job , they don't pay benefits . 
they're starting to cut back . especially startups . 
i know here at trans ark , uh , we get health care 
and that's it . 
i mean , there's no dental or vision . 
and is a ninety day policy 
and there is no longterm disability policy . 
so , you know , at least in the case of this particular company , they tend to scrimp a little bit there . 
and , you know , of course , they can use the excuse 
well , we're startup . 
but you know what's happening is the , disability plan , you know , 
so many people are lying about their things . 
god , there's been big articles in the paper about that . 
uh , you know , they claim a back injury 
and then someone goes out and spies on them 
and they're lifting refrigerators into trucks 
so i don't know what's happening and what's going to happen . 
but , uh  , 
well that certainly doesn't help matters any . 
i mean , you know , these additional benefits , 
well , uh , no 
seems to be to easy to get busy with other things . 
uh , i have , in the past , uh , jogged and , and run , 
and every january and every september , i start out again 
and then it tapers off .
uh , what about you ? 
well , yeah , 
right now , i'm into jazzercise , which i absolutely love . 
uh , i started about two years ago because i gained some weight over the past few years 
and i wanted to get it back off 
 and i was going through a divorce 
and i just found that running really made me feel good . 
got out a lot of aggression . 
i went to the gym every day 
and i ran on the treadmill and rode the bike 
and , uh , i felt really good . 
i needed to do it 
and it was really helpful at the time . 
now when i do those things , they're boring . 
i would rather be outside then in the gym doing this in one place . 
and so i just recently discovered jazzercise , about two months ago . 
and i'm getting to be a good dancer from it 
and i'm just feeling really good . 
i love the class , 
it's real challenging , 
so i'm really into that , 
i really like that a lot . 
well now the aerobic , uh ,    , 
but it's with dance steps . 
it's an aerobic exercise 
and it's an hour straight . 
and uh , it's a lot of fun . 
and i'm getting much better . 
my stamina is getting great for the dance floor 
 , so 
there's a lot of positive things with it , 
well , uh , okay . 
now that's inside again , 
and i've 
and i just enjoy that much more too than inside . 
with other people . 
i mean like the jazzercise would be ? 
i have a thirteen year old daughter 
and so we go bike riding 
and it's nice . 
we get 
so i've enjoyed that part of it . 
and at the gym , even in the class , uh , i , 
it's not really a group where you chat a lot . 
everybody's on their way to someplace 
 and so , you know , i do 
but , basically , i do it by myself in a group of maybe forty 
 , so . 
but still doing the same thing . 
there are . 
it's more motivating that way , i think . 
in terms of motivation and incentive , 
you could get a tape probably and do it at home in front of the t v 
but i , 
you probably wouldn't . 
 uh , that makes a difference doesn't it ? 
one thing , 
when i have run and jogged , uh , 
i've always enjoyed doing it by myself 
and , kno , 
not with the sense that it was , uh , uh , chore or something that i was having to do , 
i've really enjoyed just the activity 
and , uh , i write software , uh , as far as the job 
and so getting out and being active , uh , uh , uh , helps out . 
 the , th , 
i can see it'll be a good break . 
  the  change of pace and just 
and i find that i can often , you know , 
often , uh , when i get around to doing it , then i feel better when i get back to work 
 and , uh , uh , also my subconscious is working on things while i'm working 
 and i go back 
and i've got new ideas , 
but  still  .
i think you do . 
you feel very good after you exercise . 
i think 
you owe it to yourself 
 and i think you do accomplish more after that . 
and i think that it's just is good for your selfesteem , for everything because when you look better , you feel better 
and it's just , uh , 
i think it's well worth it . 
i just demand that time for myself . 
now i've learned to do that 
i think it just benefits you all around . 
that you've just got to 
you have to . 
there is always things that you can make priority to it 
but i don't demand a lot for myself 
and so 
and i take it  , 
 well good , 
 well , uh , uh , have you done any jogging ? 
i tell you , you said you did on the bike and on the treadmill in the , uh , club . 
but i find that when you do that , you do more chatting than you do 
and that's not really beneficial , 
so , uh 
and i spend enough time chatting around .
uh , read any good books lately ? .
 uh , yes , 
uh , lot of them related to , uh , business and financial matters since that's what i do for a living . 
oh , okay . 
how about yourself ? 
uh , well i'm in graduate school 
but i don't know if i consider very many of them good .
uh , i haven't read a book for enjoyment since , i guess , around christmas . 
uh , i received , uh , uh , several books for christmas 
and at christmas break i read , uh , sarum by , uh , uh , a fellow named rutherford . 
uh , it's the history of , uh , 
well it's sort of in england . 
and so , i really enjoyed that book a lot . 
uh , he's not quite as good as , you know , michener or uh , some of the other historical writers . 
but he did this job well , 
well , that sounds good . 
i read a book recently called iron john . 
have you seen that by bly ? 
well it's a book about ,
 and how they deal with life itself .
i think i have heard about that . 
that sounds great . 
of manhood ? 
i have heard of that . 
i have , uh , someone suggested that i read it . 
is it iron john ? 
by bly , 
b l y , i believe it is . 
b l y ? 
and , uh , it's a very interesting book . 
uh , what are your favorite , uh , 
well , it depends again if we're talking about  , uh , 
and i read a lot of books in the area of , uh , uh , psychology and selfhelp type , uh , materials . 
uh , always trying to understand people 
my work is my hobby .
 so i enjoy it . 
uh , who is your , favorite religious author ? 
well , i don't know if i have a favorite 
i would have to say that , uh , some of the ones that consistently put out good materials ,
that's difficult because one person might write one book extremely well and some other ones might not write as well . 
uh , i had to stop here and think a second . 
one of the ones that i've read recently that i've read several of his books 
and i thought that each one of his books were good . 
he's the man out of san antonio . 
and , uh , 
max lucado ? 
max consistently writes good books . 
uh , he's a great man . 
i've met him several times . uh , 
i know him , 
uh , i'd say another , which is a local writer here in plano , uh , is , uh , 
i'm trying to think of his name . 
he's with the bible church . 
and that is , uh , 
 , i see his name 
but i can't , 
i mean i see him 
but i can't see his name .
but uh , he talks about a lot of different topics 
um , what kind of hobbies do you have ? 
well , um , i do crossstitch 
and i enjoy reading and playing softball . 
uh , i started knitting awhile ago , 
i knitted 
i didn't even know what the stitch is called . 
i just had this , uh , uh , piece of yarn 
and i wanted to start something 
so i remembered something i learned i think when i was five years old 
 so i kept doing that , 
and now i have a little blanket 
but that's all i've done . 
oh , really . 
well , i know that i learned how to knit one time and , um , made a few things 
but i haven't done it in so long that i probably wouldn't remember how .
well , if i remember i think we made some , like christmas stockings , 
you could make like the granny squares or whatever ,
i see . 
nothing as big as a blanket . 
i know that my husband's grandmother does a lot of that . 
and she makes a lot of afghans and all that kind of stuff 
i probably won't make anything beyond this blanket .
i don't know why . 
it's just too time consuming . 
do you have any other hobbies ? 
um , i like to sing . 
i've been trying to get some wedding gigs and things like that . 
oh , well that's good . 
um , right now my actual job is a news reporter . 
but , uh , if i could do anything i wanted to do , it would be to sing professionally . 
but um , 
so are you on the t v then ? 
i'm in , uh , 
i work for channel six in waco . 
oh , okay . 
and so i do little news reports and things . 
it's not as exciting as it  ,
but , um , 
so you don't have too much time for hobbies ? 
um , my day is usually pretty full . 
my schedule is like from nine to five thirty , 
but i could be at work from anytime , you know , from nine until nine at night or ten or whatever , 
so it's hard to make plans much less , you know , have a hobby . 
so . what do you do ? 
i'm a housewife . 
oh , okay . 
so , unless the kids are asleep i don't usually get much done either .
but i've made a , um , few things , crossstitch things . 
i really enjoy doing that . 
and um , i made , uh , like stockings for both my children and a christmas tree shirt and that ,
and it just takes a long time to get it done 
but , you know , once you've done something like that it kind of makes you feel good , to , 
i showed mine to my boyfriend 
oh , yeah , 
actually , first thing i did 
i guess you can make baby blankets that wouldn't take as long .
how many children do you have ? 
oh , okay . 
i hear them in the background  there  .
all right , 
that's a hobby in itself . 
not  quite  .
 a job in itself . 
it's a fulltime job , 
 right now i was just sitting here watching t v , 
i was getting ready to fall asleep . 
so , um , have you sang at any weddings yet ? 
um , it was my first wedding . 
i've done , um , little commercials and background singing 
and , um , i sang all through college and things like that 
but i really haven't done anything really , professional per se . 
but i did one wedding last year 
and i've been passing them out to different wedding shops , 
i mean when someone comes in ,
oh , that's a good place , 
this one woman even wanted me to bring my tape in because i have a demo tape , you know , if any one wants to listen . 
and , uh , she wanted me to bring it in , 
she's going to play it on saturday 
well , that's good . 
but i only just put them out this week 
and it's the wedding season , i guess . 
oh , that's true . 
then i could be getting paid for something i love to do . 
not that i don't like reporting , 
but , i'd love it . 
did you have training in singing when you were ,
i've just been singing every chance i get . 
i try , you know , 
choirs and that kind of stuff ? 
and , yeah , 
choirs 
and we did , uh , little conventions and , um , uh , like dinner parties and things like that . 
sing pop music . 
well , that's nice . 
so , that's what got me really , really interested in it . 
so i'm trying to be sensible , too , at the same time . 
not just give up your job and jump right into it .
my parents would have a fit probably . 
but , uh , i think , 
i either have a call or , 
i do have a call , 
hold on one second . 
that's my mother on the other line , 
i need to go , 
i don't know , 
oh , okay , 
so , i don't know . 
 oh , okay . 
 but , uh , okay 
well , it was nice talking to you 
good luck with your singing . 
uh , you want to start by telling me what camping is to you . 
nothing overly strenuous . 
that sounds interesting . 
oh , it's , 
we've had a lot of fun , uh , 
i moved to dallas about five years ago 
and we've made three different trips since i've been here . the group of friends that i run around with , of varying degrees , uh , of difficulty . 
uh , was a canoe trip in arkansas 
and the river it was up about three feet 
so it was pretty challenging . 
oh , man , i imagine . 
uh , and then we , uh , 
as far as the camping part of that , we just drag along all our tents and sleeping bags and , uh , uh , find a clearing in the woods and go for it . 
so they'll actually fit in the canoe 
and then you go for days at a time . 
well , yeah , 
it's the , 
that particular one was a two day trip 
so what , uh , 
uh , there's a outfitter 
and , uh , they haul you up to the headwaters , come down about halfway and then you spend the night 
and then , uh , the second day head on down to the pool at the end of the river . 
god , that sounds like fun .
it really is . 
well the camping i grew up with was like tents and coleman stove type . 
and , uh , you know , that just either out in the woods , or 
actually i grew up water skiing . 
i was , uh , from california , 
and so we would go up to the sacramento , uh , river sloughs , the delta there , 
and you just pick a campground on the river , 
cooled off , 
but , uh , when i got married , my husband had always backpacked . 
and so we did that , uh , 
i guess we haven't done it since my kids were born about three years ago . 
and that was a new experience for me 
but i enjoyed it . 
i like being able to go back into the mountains ,
boy , i bet , 
but , uh , that was interesting . 
i have always wanted to do some white water rafting 
and so your canoeing kind of made me think of that . 
uh , that's always been our next step . 
our little group of friends here , we've been kind of getting married off and what not 
but , uh , 
don't let that stop you .
well , it just puts a damper on things for a little while . 
i know . 
but we're starting to get everybody back together . 
we'd like to do a float trip down , uh , oh , like big bend area or something like that . 
so you haven't done that before . 
my parents , uh , were sailing , uh , this last year down off , uh , costa rica 
and they took about two weeks and went into , 
i don't even know the name of the river there , 
but they went white water rafting 
i'll bet , 
and , you know , i , 
there's that sense of it , you know , you're kind of scared , that risk of like gosh , what could happen and then the thrill of , you know , the excitement of doing it , 
well , do you have anything planned for this summer ? 
we've , uh , 
well i do have , uh , a little bit of property , 
i grew up in south dakota , 
oh , okay . 
and i've got a piece of property in minnesota that is completely undeveloped as of yet . 
uh , there's a little lake up there 
and , uh , a group of friends that i went to college with , um , got together 
and we basically own all the land around this little lake , there , 
it's divided up into ten lots . 
oh , i imagine . 
so , we've got a private lake , 
and it's completely undeveloped at this point , 
so , that's a possibility . 
and the weather is typically always nice up there in the summertime . 
it's about two hours north of minneapolis . 
oh that sounds good . 
so , uh , yeah , 
in fact , uh , uh , 
well i got married last summer 
and , uh , that's , 
we ended up there for a couple days , uh , on our honeymoon . 
we kind of took , uh , a tour of the united states for about a week ,
that sounds , 
but , uh , my wife's real excited about it , 
so , uh , we're going to hope to get up there sometime early eno , 
last year it was the end of july 
and it was a little too late for the fish 
but , uh , hopefully get up there early enough some of the fish and , uh , the , the good weather and what not . 
we've been wanting to start camping again this year too . 
uh , my oldest child is a girl , was born three years ago , three and a half . 
and then i have a little one that just turned two 
and we are in the process of potty training . 
i didn't want to go camping with diapers , you know . 
oh gosh , 
and , you know at a time when they're afraid of their shadow all they need is , you know , some skunk or something to rub up the outside of the tent , 
they'd be awake all night . 
that's right . 
i'm hoping and crossing my fingers that we'll be able to go , uh , this summer , you know , even if it's like over to rio dosa for a couple of days ,
you bet , 
we'll that , you know 
and there's a lot of places with , uh , like nature trails ,
well that's true . 
you know , it's like , okay , this is what , uh , a pheasant looks like , you know , 
and okay , now we'll go look for one . 
ugh , i would need that before i could teach them .
 well , yeah , 
everybody might learn something that way , 
uh , but yeah 
anything you want to do . 
hunt with a camera type of thing 
or , there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that . 
it's a lot of fun , 
it really is . 
but this is , 
i have a son who's graduating , uh , in may , 
and there's some interesting problems how do you challenge the kids today . 
and i have some real hangups . 
i think that , uh , if your kid's not ambitious , he can sure get lost . 
in the school systems ? 
that's right . 
what school system does he go to ? 
in north garland , 
he goes t , 
what school system are you familiar with ? 
my children go to garland , 
and i teach in dallas . 
y , oh , 
 well , i have a daughter that's 
in the , 
are you familiar with the international baccalaureate program . 
well , yeah , 
oh , okay . 
so , yeah . 
well , there's a , 
it's , um , 
she went from austin academy when it opened up ,
but at north garland , you can get some masses , 
but unless , if the kid's really dedicated , it seems like they do all right . 
but if your child is just pressing along , uh , 
i , i'm firmly convinced that teachers aren't being paid enough . 
would you , argue with that ? 
i'm definitely not , 
are you kidding ? 
 well you know if there was an opportunity for teachers to teach year around . 
i want that .
well would , 
i think it would be better for the teachers and for the children , because we would do away with so much of the burnout that we have . 
i know when you get the kids that have gone the summer being out of school , then it's like they've lost so much ground , we spend at least the first six weeks just backing up , reteaching what they had the year before . you know . 
well how do we get that ? 
well , we're starting pilot schools . 
it's a , 
dallas is doing it i know . 
i think plano , don't they have some , 
and richardson's supposed to start some pilot schools , going to school year around . 
and then you know , we investigated this by flying some people out from dallas to observe some of the schools in california that already had it . 
does it work well out there ? 
and one thing , it'll save us money , because we've got the buildings sitting there , 
and we might as well use them . 
well , what about the issue of air conditioning . 
isn't that an area of concern in the cost of air conditioning ? 
well , air conditioning , and heating . 
oh , yeah . 
like , if we get in the thirties , we raise it up to the seventies , 
that's forty degrees . 
isn't it less ? 
you're right . 
but i think , 
and it's not like the kids are going to go a lot longer , 
really , if you go year around 
well how do they do it ? 
do they put , uh , long , 
do they put two or three week breaks between ? 
there's different ways to do it . 
like i think going two six weeks and then having two , two weeks off , each after a two six weeks period is one way . 
is that , 
from what you've seen , is that the desirable way to do it ? 
see , i don't know , because i've never seen it in action . 
oh i thought you , 
oh , okay . 
but you didn't go . 
and i know a lot of teachers that would like to try it . 
well , that i hear that the local commentator i listen to   some the idea that the numbers of administration and the fact that the principal , 
do you see that the principals aren't really in charge ? 
the principal's , hands are tied , by all the administrators , 
and i heard that in dallas , it's one out of every three is actually in the classroom of the educators that were hired .
well i had heard that one of the comments when they brought it , 
it's just , 
you don't even know who all your bosses are . 
it's ridiculous . 
um . then why the , 
the one they brought in , the new superintendent for dallas schools , the admini , um , 
can't think of his name , 
but the idea 
marvin edwards . 
but they resented the fact that he would try to save some costs there . 
well , you know he did , supposedly cut administrators , 
but what they've done is create other offices for those same people , and just renamed their jobs 
one thing we've got going is called reading and initiative , 
and they've hired all these administrators in on that , you know . 
well , you know , the other thing that bothers me is the amount of money the football , um , issue . 
pass or no fail , what is it ? 
but the 
no play . 
i can't think of the name of the school ,
but in any event they kept arguing . 
carter high school . 
and they went to court , 
i mean , i , you know , 
guess i'm sympathetic with the kids , 
to fight that in court . 
and all the things that dallas fights , costs thousands , probably millions of dollars , i bet you . 
but just think of all the , all the lawyers you've kept employed , 
i know . 
and psychologists and stuff . 
that's right , 
and all these other people are out running around . 
i guess that's the only problem with jobs being relatively scarce , 
 but you need to keep all these people employed , 
 and  , 
you mean , we need a little more of our tax money , like maybe , uh , 
we need more of the tax money to actually get down to the students , because it's pretty frustrating when you see you don't even have paper , 
and you're trying to ration it , you know , 
now that's sad , when there's supposed to be what , you know , one thousand , sixtyfive dollars , something like that , spent on each pupil . 
um , it's wrong . 
anyway , i was thinking about 
one thing that's wrong with schools is that we're not teaching to the children's modalities , 
and i think in nineteen , uh , ninetythree we're supposed to begin that . 
if a child is a visual learner , we're supposed to present him with all these visual things , 
and if he has to learn just by kinesthetic , we're supposed to teach whatever way that that child has to have it , learns the best way . 
and that's going to be quite a problem . 
  oh that's , 
but if we could do something like that i'm sure it would certainly help . 
um , that's interesting , 
and how many administrators is that going to take ? 
i don't know , 
no telling , 
i don't know . 
and , you know , at nongraded schools . 
they've had one in gladewater for years and years and years . 
if we could just let these kids go at their own rate . 
i have children even , 
i teach chapter one , 
and it's for kids that have fallen behind in their reading according to , like i t b s scores . 
and some of the kids , really they shouldn't be in there , 
and you know , they're not being challenged , 
and they're not being challenged in their home , 
and we always have to teach toward the middle of the road . 
well , um , would like to go to rice , 
but i don't think he's , 
well , are overachievers . 
and he's not an overachiever . 
but the same time , everybody can't go , 
but it , 
the question you know , of how far should you take a kid in the motivation , 
i'm not sure , 
i think maybe there's too much responsibility put on the teachers to motivate these kids . 
but that a lot of the schools i would think the kids you're talking to , question of how much reading do those kids' parents do . 
my children's parents aren't even there at night most of the time 
well , but that's the point , as i would say , uh 
 and that's what makes , 
there's a lot of problems . 
and they cut , 
i know it , 
oh another things that's wrong with schools , 
this is big , 
there's too much emphasis on test . 
we're spending the first hour of every day teaching for the   test at my school , 
and we're going to do that until at least the first part of may . 
well see , that's in the garland schools , 
the numbers , 
i don't think they have to do that because most everybody passes . 
 but see , they're not in dallas . 
well , opportunity , 
if you get graded on percent improvement . 
 but see , that . 
and unfortunately , that's tough , 
that's a real challenge though . 
but , uh . 
but see , what we're doing is we're turning these kids off to school even more than they are . 
and we're not teaching toward the test , 
we're teaching , you know , 
i always objected , you know , 
it's like there's not a whole lot of , you know , fun time like we used to have in school . 
and you can't do that as adults . 
but we're expecting kids to . 
and like after recess , play 
we don't get that . 
if they finish before their thirty minutes is up , then they can go out and play for like maybe five or ten minutes , probably be the most . 
but we always got that , 
didn't you ? 
well , yeah , 
he had an attention deficit disorder , 
and they were keeping him from recess 
and in reality uh , that's one of those really tough situations . 
i think the kids need some time to play . 
but ,     and change some education 
so . uh , i got some background noise there 
but i guess  . . . 
well , uh , before i was married , i used to play a lot of sports . 
uh , but when i got married and had children and everything , it seems like i keep all my activity just chasing around fulfilling my obligations 
so i haven't done a lot of , uh , exercise on purpose . 
what about you ? 
well , it's funny , 
this week , 
yesterday i started exercising seriously . 
oh , really ? 
this weekend i cleaned out my closets 
and , uh , a couple years ago i , too , got married . 
i haven't have any children yet , 
but this weekend i cleaned out some closets 
and i found a bathing suit that i had bought . 
tried it on and decided i really did not like how it looked on me . 
 oh no , 
so yesterday i went to , uh , a spa . 
i belong to a private spa and went in and got with a trainer 
and , uh , he checked body fat content 
 and we set up a program for me to work on , 
and i went back tonight also . 
so i've been two nights in a row 
and i'm going to take it pretty seriously . 
i'm going to start going every night just , you know , 
even if i , 
like tonight i only went for thirty minutes , 
but i at least did something . 
do you work out on , 
like , is it the weight machines or aerobics or what is it ? 
last night i did about thirty minutes of riding a bike and like , three different types of , uh , uh , weight lifting for my legs and , 
 and then i did a hour of aerobics . 
and that was really tough .
oh , i bet . 
and i was sore this morning when i got up , 
but then tonight i got into a , 
it's sort of like an aerobics class 
 but it's only thirty minutes 
and it's for your abdominals 
and that was , 
thirty minutes was definitely plenty . 
doesn't sound like low impact . 
well that's good . 
so are you moti , 
have you started exercising at home 
well , like , i am undisciplined in the sense that i can't just go and do exercise , 
but i like to , uh , play tennis and play racquetball 
i like to get exercise when i'm playing a game of some sort , 
and so that's always been the way that i have kept myself in , uh , the shape that i was satisfied with at least . 
and , uh , then i have given that up , 
but , uh , i would really like to start that again , because i am now , you know , not in a position that i like myself . 
i don't feel good 
and i get , you know , 
when you get out of shape and you don't , 
you're easily tired 
 and so that has made me , 
but i'm not the kind of person that could go to a spa 
i just , 
if something like , uh , 
i mean i have so many chores and so many 
and i wouldn't enjoy it . 
but if i have something , some team sport or some activity , then it's kind of like having fun ,
and then you get some of the , uh , good exercise and some of the desired results , 
but you're doing it for fun . 
but i really admire people who can go and work out 
well , i don't , you know , 
a lot of people , 
i have a girlfriend that goes for the social aspect of it 
 and she walks around , talks to people 
 , and , i don't really get into that . 
naturally i'm married 
 so my husband goes a lot 
and we'll go and just do what we want to do and then leave . 
well , that's nice . 
but , yeah , 
and swimming i'd like to get into as far as my  , you know , 
just aerobic activity 
so i'd like to try that as well . 
and that's probably something that you could do , you know 
it is kind , 
it is family , 
and it's fun . 
and kids enjoy that and all . 
and also , the nice thing about belonging to a club is that you can have some of the relaxation , you know , like saunas , or 
you can relax that way ,
i agree .
well , i guess it's getting late . 
and i should take off , 
but , uh , i appreciate that , 
that helped motivate me .
think someone can do it . 
maybe i should start thinking about it again . 
well , try it 
or maybe just exercise at home . 
i bought a tape , 
and i'm going to try doing that . 
i bought one , 
i went to the , 
i bought the low impact first . 
that's me . 
but i haven't done it . 
but i'm going to try it . 
well you have a good night . 
thanks a lot . 
we'll see you . 
so , uh , what do you think about our involvement in the middle east ? 
 well , actually , i think it's good . 
i hope that we , uh , uh , get a chance to , uh , promote peace out there , uh , because i think without peace we're not going to get stable oil prices , 
i'd really like to see stability in that area , because i'm always afraid that's where another big war is going to start . not that desert storm was a small one . 
that's probably true . 
i suspect that if any world war is coming at this point in time , they're going to come from there , uh , i would think , anyway . 
just seems to be that that's the most unstable part of the world , as far as i can tell . 
i saw , um , just recently , where , uh , uh , the u s is supposedly going to be , uh , putting pressure on all the , you know , the israelis , supposedly , to come to a bargaining table to , 
actually i heard that the israelis at least mentioned about giving up some of the golan heights . 
that would be interesting because i'm jewish 
and i'm actually sort of not really a zionist per se , you know . 
but um , i have a lot of friends , you know , who are sort of adamant , you know , israel , 
it's his right , 
and do whatever they want . 
and i think they've been sort of hard nosed about the entire thing . 
and , you know , in some sense , the moderates may be right . 
they you know , may be better if they give up just a little bit to settle things down . 
well , uh , i guess it's one of those things that , uh , if it's going to really promote a lasting peace , if there is not going to be a peace , 
then is it worth it at all . 
i mean , i could the way , 
i mean , the only way to think about it is well , they won , you know , 
they sort of took over the , um , 
they're one of the only countries in history that has been told that they have to give back what they took in a war , which they didn't start , basically , 
so , i don't know what to do about it .
but i think that you know , in general the region is really in bad shape .
do you think the u s is going to wind up keeping , uh , military bases over there ? 
isn't there a plan now to make a command center there or something ? 
i haven't heard that . 
i watch c n n every once in a while , 
i just heard something recently , about moving , um 
there's some central command post in tampa  , i think that they now want to move to somewhere in the middle east . 
actually , there was , um , a small country or small city , i think , not actually in saudi arabia or anything , but a little bit off to the , um , east of it , i think . 
and i , 
they want to keep something over there , so that they don't have to , um , 
i guess it's sort of so they don't have to move troops out so quickly or something . 
i'm not quite sure exactly why they want to do it . 
but they want to keep some sort of central command post there . 
what i thought was interesting is that , uh , apparently the formal cease fire has not actually been signed yet . 
that's true . 
and , uh , then i guess there's still the possibility that , uh , hostilities with , uh , u s troops could still break out . 
they claim that's why we're still there . 
i mean , you know , why only , 
you note it's only a small number of people have actually come back yet . 
but i think that's actually the scariest part , because what's happening in iraq right now , you know , in itself , it being so crazy there . 
i have no idea , 
i mean , what do you know , 
and it's going to be worse . 
i don't know . um . 
do you have relatives over in israel ? 
i have some friends in israel , 
and coincidently actually my wife is syrian . um . 
oh , really . 
so i am , 
and , uh , pardon me , i'm just sort of putting away some things from dinner now 
but um , we , 
she has sort of friends and family in saudi arabia , who are some friends in saudi arabia . 
and , um , i have some friends in israel . 
and we talk a bit about it , 
but we try and keep it out of the home life . 
do you , uh , 
does she ever want to go back to syria ? 
she is actually , um , 
oh , okay . 
her parents who were born here would like to go see it , though , i think . 
they would like to go to syria , 
but they recognize that syria's not the place that one wants to visit 
you know , something about the place makes it not quite enjoyable . 
do you ever want to go over to israel ? 
oh , okay . 
i was there a couple of years ago , when it wasn't , you know , sort of dangerous to be out there , i guess . 
and , do like it actually . 
i would never live there . 
i think i'm too americanized and , um sort of have you know , too much invested in sort of , the easy life . 
well who , you know , 
do you have a lot of kosher foods there at your house ? 
actually my house is kosher , 
but it turns out that one of the strangest things um , most folks don't realize that for all the food people think of as sort of , you know , jewish food and so forth . 
um , and , you know , um , in general it really isn't the food that is eaten in israel . 
so you typically think of it , like bagels , 
right , you know , 
bagels and lox . 
turns out , you don't really find bagels in israel . 
what you find is sort of middle eastern foods . 
the same foods that you find in , um , syria and egypt and everything else . 
  have you ever had those ? 
oh , knishes , 
you don't see a lot of , 
that's basically eastern european jewish food . 
it's very different . 
i was actually very amazed when i sort of figured out for myself . that everything i grew up with really wasn't israeli . 
it was more jewish , you know . 
i got you . 
it is very strange . 
still get your passover matzi and all that , 
that's what i'm making , 
that's what i'm doing now . 
i'm making dinner . 
oh really . 
a nice jewish girl for many years up in chicago , 
and i was the only goyim at all the seder dinners and everything , 
and i used to have to go with pocketful of change to buy all this bread the kids would see me .
bought up all the bread from .
that's good . 
well , you've really got a handle on this stuff i've noticed . 
got the vocabulary down and everything . 
just , just enough to get by .
that makes you real good . 
actually , we have the reverse situation . 
turned out that , um , um , most of my friends aren't jewish , 
and my wife's not . 
but um , i sort of , you know , do a lot of these things , 
so that , um , 
our first seder is tomorrow night . 
and this is a rare exception . 
there are going to be sixteen people at my house tomorrow night , which , 
and five of them will be jewish . 
two years ago we had a seder , 
we had sixteen people each night . 
sixteen is the magic number for us . 
and i was the only jew both nights . 
oh really .
get to see it . 
and my view is , passover should sort of be , 
it sort of predates christ . 
well , they had the , 
matter of fact i just watched charles heston uh , this weekend in the ten commandments . 
i caught the end of that . 
did you ? 
but yeah . 
that's what always amazes me , actually , um , is that , you know , 
my wife and i always sort of bring this up about her being syrian , you know , and my being jewish , you know . 
we look alike , 
we act alike , 
we sound alike , 
well , not totally alike 
but you know . um , um , it's amazing to think that people in the middle east sort of all hate each other . 
well , that's , 
to me it's really , um , 
i guess i can intellectually kind of come to grips with all of that . 
but , you know , emotionally i have a real difficult time believing that people that believe in god and love , not war and to forgive can't get together . 
you know , i mea , 
i know that the problems are so deep . 
but i mean , even within the muslim , uh , religions , different sects , they can't get together . 
that i find really strange . 
i mean , i sort of understand somewhat . 
i mean , i , 
knowing the history i understand that , the hatred of the muslims for , you know , the israelis or whatever , 
and i can sort of handle that 
   , but i sort of think about the muslims sort of running around have jihad against themselves . 
you know , i mean , and that seems really weird . 
or , uh , you know , the catholics and the protestants up in ireland . 
you know , i mean , 
same thing . 
i don't , 
i'll never understand it . 
my view is look , what did you ever do to me . 
didn't hurt me , at the moment . 
i don't know . 
there's something about , 
there's a poem somewhere . 
i don't know if you've ever seen it or not , 
but everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten . 
in this , 
and it talks about how , you know , if we could just all get toge , you know , 
when we were young everything was great because we all went to class together , 
and in the mi , you know , 
we all had snack time together , 
and then we all took naps 
and we all held hands and hugged , you know , 
and that's what kindergarten was like , 
and wouldn't it be nice if we could solve all our problems by just sort of getting together and everyone in the world sat down and took a nap together . 
woke up and had snack time , you know , and then hugged each other as we left . 
it sounds like a john lennon , uh , type . 
i wonder if he secretly did that  . . . 
are you a t i er , 
oh , really , 
that's great . 
i rely primarily on , uh , newspaper combined with television . 
huh , that , 
you're the opposite of me . 
i drive an hour each way to work 
and so if i just use time 
and not say one , which quality is the best , 
i guess , that would be two hours roughly of talk shows and news on radio 
and then newspapers and t v would be tied after that because maybe i'll catch the evening news , like ten o'clock on t v 
and i , 
so that's a half an hour roughly the same with newspaper . 
i really , 
of course , you're in a different part of the country , 
i really listen to a lot of the talk shows , i don't mean the gossip ones , 
but there's a lot 
on the weekends when i do chores , or whatever , 
i'm a radio hound i guess , 
i take the radio with me when i'm working on my car , the lawn or whatever , 
and turn on , 
they have everything from lawn work , lawyers , news , uh , veterinarians , all kinds of items , uh , 
so when i'm doing chores . 
that's rather interesting . 
i find it surprising . because a lot of times , it , here , you know , 
i'll talk to some people here 
and i'll mention some talk host 
and i'll expect them to have an opinion on why i don't like him and don't listen , 
they don't even know ,
most people haven't heard of bruce williams . 
you probably haven't either unless you're a radio buff . 
i'd have to say i haven't either . 
he is in new jersey and is entrepreneur and kind of a selfmade millionaire . 
and , he has it , 
well it's five seventy here , 
i'm trying to , 
it's on cliff , 
i don't know what the , 
he's on all stations . 
you might remember the name bruce williams , 
and he is again , national and talks about a lot of financial things . 
but , the here , i just get a kick out of , uh , 
well we do a lot of gardening here , 
so there's , 
we have an excellent gardener here , 
has three hours on sunday and three hours on saturday . 
but , i am kind of a radio buff . 
i listen to the radio , uh , probably five or six hours a week , 
but almost inevitably to a station that is a classical , uh , station here    , 
for music ? 
we don't use the radio as a wake up , 
we have a television connected to a , uh , uh , electronic alarm ,
and it comes on with c n n in the morning . 
oh , yeah . 
that's good . 
we wake up to television news and , uh , uh , shower and dress , and whatever to that , 
and then because of the fact that my wife and i ride to work together , uh , in a car ,
oh , that's good . 
uh , and occasionally what we'll each do depending on whoever is driving is have the newspaper sort of on our lap on the way in the car , 
so we have the advantage of being able to , uh , read and drive although there seems to be , from what i've seen on the freeway recently that a fair number of people are reading and driving .
my wife always wonders about that 
 so , of the two . 
i also , uh , use , uh , newsweek magazine . uh , 
we tend to alternate between newsweek and time and whatever happens to be the , 
we get , 
 and , uh , i read sporadically of commentary and a couple of other , you know , trade magazines , uh , some of the other tabloids i get . 
so , uh , i guess i use about eighty percent written , is probably my input and twenty percent , uh , television . 
 go ahead   , 
i've always said that it's really not interesting unless it's three weeks old and found its way into a news weekly headline . 
good point . 
that's a good point . 
uh , other than that it was a   at best . 
oh , yeah . 
it comes and goes . 
 uh , we're probably not thrilled with our only newspaper that we have in raleigh . 
there are other , uh , uh , 
i'm not sure what you would call them , the small , uh , competing independent sort of newspapers . 
little small weekly things , 
but there's only one daily , uh , called the news and observer , fondly referred to here by some as the , uh , uh , sometimes the noise and observer . 
 uh , it depends . 
it , has decent national coverage , but has an extremely focused political coverage , probably steeped in ,
local you mean ? 
and , uh , consequently everything is filtered through that , uh , republican democratic sort of ,
don't they have city council meetings and all that . 
are you into any of that and the school boards and all that ? 
we have that addition to our paper . 
we have , 
that is , uh , 
as a matter of fact they update it once a week with a special section , 
and we pay it sort of glancing nod . 
we , uh , have a very good friend who is , uh , tapped into the city planning structure . uh , our developer architect friend 
 , you get it from people then . 
so , i think we find out what's happening in the city , uh , on a fairly frequent basis , over a gin and tonic sort of thing . 
uh , and that probably gives us a better insight as to the city of raleigh than the paper would have anyway . 
my wife and i , you know , as mentioned , 
 uh , she reads the paper from front to back 
and so she'll tell me some stuff 
well , i always read the sports , uh , 
what am i thinking of , uh , the commentaries , 
i can't even think of what it is offhand , 
and she's always reading something , 
and , i say , i never have time to read it like you do . 
but , i always get a lot of my information from the ,
uh , so , i guess we do get it from people too . 
oh , you mentioned c n n , of course i mentioned radio and the c n n t v news , you know ? 
it's the same thing that's on the radio , word for word . 
is that right ? 
and it , 
because , uh , 
we have it here at work as a matter if fact , at t i . 
we have it in the break area , c n n . 
look at this , you know . 
and when i first heard c n n , it only started about , uh , since the war , you know , or right before that . 
and , they would always say look at this , 
and there would be a pause , you know , 
and i realized that it's the exact commentary that you have 
that didn't , uh , 
 but , it's still good . 
it's still , uh , uh , you know , 
you don't really miss anything . 
but , i do enjoy since the gulf war listening to c n n radio too , as well as watching c n n on t v here at work . 
i don't have c n n at home . 
let me turn this radio off , 
i'm actually at work right now believe it or not . 
uh , where was i , 
go ahead , 
your turn . 
uh , we probably were listening to c n n fairly heavily before the war broadcasts began . 
uh , we almost live because during the war itself to the point where we began to sort of have household pact of lets turn the war off and get something done . 
i've heard that , 
 uh , almost an addition , uh , 
uncoupling from the events , and going on with their . 
instead of watching the missiles and being glued to the tube or whatever . uh , 
and because of that we began towards the middle of the war , i guess about two and a half or three weeks in , we began to restrict our news almost deliberately where we would , uh , watch , uh , fifteen minutes before , fifteen minutes after six our time which would be national news , or our local news . 
we would watch c n n until six thirty , then we would watch , uh , a rotating network news of either , uh , a b c , c b s , or n b c 
and we sort of just rotated around the dial each night a different one . 
and then we would turn the television off 
and we were sort of limiting or dieting ourselves on news that way . 
and , then we would do a similar thing , uh , at uh , ten fortyfive because , uh , c n n would be wrapping their hourly coverage up 
and then we would get the local coverage , uh , 
and then i think the local coverage we would tend to watch the same station that would have better state coverage rather than local coverage . 
uh , three of the networks here , on their local news , uh , 
if you wish to listen at eleven o'clock you can find out who raped who , murdered who , or stole what .
oh , yeah . 
and , that was the sort of thing that i would say is the best  mumblex 
 and not news 
unless there's some trend or something that says , jesus this neighborhood has been hit fortyseven times or whatever . uh , of a pattern news . 
i never get home early enough for those five and six o'clock , 
so , tell me about your home . 
my home . 
all right , 
my home is about fifteen years old . 
all right . 
it's a two story house , 
it's our first home , 
and it looks like it's going to be the last , 
i think we're going to demolish it .
we've got two children 
and it's , 
they have scraped the , uh , plaster off the walls , you know , with riding their little toys through it and stuff . you know , 
put dents in the tiles , just multitude of them , 
i mean even places , 
it's past the dent stage , 
we're talking some of it's been  peeled  away , you know , 
i don't know what they , 
we talking   from dents in the holes . 
i understand , 
i've got a daughter . 
we've got two , 
one of them's eleven 
and one of them's seven 
and then the carpet , you know , 
we need to replace the carpet . 
i mean , it sounds like it's just the pits 
but it's not all that bad ,  i guess  
but , you know , they're just real hard on it . 
kids are hard on houses . 
i can see why people wait until they get like in high school or maybe junior high 
and then they get another one . 
uh , we live in a mobile home 
and that's probably not typical america 
i know there's a lot of them . 
what we have , 
it's all we can afford . 
and , uh , seems like we're always working on it , as i'm sure ,
because they're always , 
how old is your child ? 
so , you know , just like yours , ours is always , you know , 
something else goes wrong always , you know , 
we had a couple plumbing problems , 
we've , oh , 
who knows , you know , it's always something with homes . 
and you said you were in colorado springs ? 
are there a lot of trailers around there ? 
and is that what you're in ? 
oh , no , 
oh , yes . 
oh , okay , 
what division are you in ? 
i'm not in t i . 
i had a friend that had a roommate that worked for t i 
she's never traveled anywhere , 
she's never been anywhere , 
she , you know , 
and she didn't understand . 
she doesn't drive . 
how does she get to work ? 
uh , she , uh , lives on campus , 
she's a college student . 
buses and , uh , public transportation . 
i had a re , 
her parents live by the public transportation . 
and i wish we could down here . 
well , it would be nice 
 well , sometimes 
but i tell you i'd sure like to be able to get on a bus or something and get to work , 
but if i did it , it would take me an hour and fifteen minutes . 
i would have to get on one and drive , or walk to a bu , you know , 
there's one terminal close to us 
and then they'd drive me to the main terminal here , 
then , i'd have to go to downtown dallas and then walk over couple blocks and get on another bus to go to my school . 
if it's anything like , uh , 
so that's too much . 
dallas always has been , 
no one wants to be at downtown dallas much . 
but there sure are a lot of people that work down there . 
is the crime rate still bad ? 
and i went down there a couple , maybe three weeks ago for a trial , 
and , i mean , all these people were standing up , that was , you know , during the workday all along the streets ,
and they're just being demolished , 
and they stink 
huh , that's terrible . 
so , garland , how nice is it now , 
it's been a while since i've been there . 
you know , i think it might be up to two hundred and fifty thousand . 
it's gotten big . 
it has . 
i think when we moved here it was like a hundred and twenty , something like that . 
and i didn't realize , when i moved here , that it was a separate town from dallas .
well , yeah , 
it is . 
i know , now 
but i didn't . 
where you from ? 
i'm from kilgore , texas 
it's in east , 
kilgore , 
i know where kilgore is . 
oh , where you from ? 
i'm originally from lubbock . 
are you ? 
so , why did you move up to colorado ? 
seemed like the thing to do at the time . 
well , it's real pretty up there . 
i have a friend ,
oh , i love it ,
i love the mountains , 
what do you , 
uh , back to the topic , 
it seems that , uh , more and more people are not   owning traditional homes these days . 
they're not owning homes , period . 
uh , everyone says , you know , 
 but now it seems that , uh , with the local economy bad and t i 
and  strange  it seems that , uh , 
it wasn't such a bad idea ? 
oh , they're doing some back pedaling . 
so , have you got , uh , land ? 
i did that one year , 
i lived with two other girls 
and we all taught . 
and it was a two bedroom , 
so , we took turns , you know , 
i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom . 
and then we had two baths 
it was just , the little bathroom , were the thing that really bothered me because i felt real closed in . 
well , mobile homes have changed a lot probably since you had one . 
that was in the seventies . 
ours is wood sided , 
and it has a traditional  v top   ,
i'm sorry . 
and , uh , it's nine hundred and eighty square foot . 
what , two bedroom , one bath ,
well , you can imagine nine hundred eighty square foot broke up into two bedrooms , one bath , 
 so have , 
it's comfy . 
are you required to by law ? 
we were down here . 
it was already setup when we bought it . 
well , i bet it's not bad . 
oh , yeah , 
it's wood sided it has sheetrock everywhere , 
uh , you know , so , it's quieter than you remember mobile homes to be . 
but how much is yours ? 
when we bought ours we were paying uh , three hundred twentynine dollars . 
oh , our payments are like two twenty . 
for how many years ? 
 oh , so ,  it was still a lot cheaper , 
and , uh , what ? 
and we bought one of the cheapest houses , you know , a tract house . 
oh , yes . 
a mobile home's a heck of a lot cheaper , 
which probably didn't make much difference . 
 have a    in it . 
what i meant was ,
in the price . 
gee , nice , huh . 
that sounds good . 
so , you know , there's not that much time left on the loan 
so , if the economy gets better , are you going to get another house ? 
i , don't know . 
you know , it's like me to pickup and move somewhere else is easy . 
but you wouldn't take that mobile home , 
you would ? 
it would be cheaper to move that than buy another one . 
you know , when you talk about the deal like i got , yeah , yeah , it would be cheaper . 
uh , especially if it were a paid move or something . 
you know , there's some paid moves occasionally . 
t i would pay to move you ? 
i don't know 
but they did , 
when i moved up here , 
so , they might want to move away . 
so , how many years you been up there ? 
uh , six or seven . 
do you snow ski ? 
mostly i just  , love walking in the mountains , driving in the mountains . 
it's real pretty . 
i went rock climbing one time . 
oh , that's exciting . 
my friend talked me in that .
i'm a real , um , scaredy when it comes to heights 
but once we got on top of the rocks it was quite , 
so , what kind of neat hobbies do you have ? 
well , i like gardening a lot , 
i like to be outside , um . 
i like gardening , 
i wish i had a green thumb , though . 
i've got a brown thumb . 
that's what everything turns . 
oh  , is , 
but , do you keep trying anyway ? 
you just can't give up on it , uh , 
uh , i bought some , uh , plants from michigan bulb company 
they send them to you all ready alive . 
oh really . 
i guess these are going to croak too . 
since i've got cats , i decided to get some catnip . 
lots and lots of catnip , 
so it's still green , 
and it's been two days 
so i'm encouraged .
i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail , probably . 
but , i've had the more expensive companies . 
there's a , uh , 
because they , 
i don't know , 
do you have lowe's up there ? 
uh , well , 
its , uh , 
building , uh , contra , 
or building supplies place . 
um , they also have a garden shop 
oh , that's great , 
now our local stores don't offer any guarantee . 
but some of the , 
something like that . 
uh , i got a whole bunch of bulbs along with this stuff , 
so , i'm going to wait on those . 
uh , probably spring , 
but , uh , i don't much care about things like that . 
i'll make a little sort of greenhouse , a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in . 
something , to keep me occupied , you see . 
i'll , uh , buy some plastic and make a little house 
and watch the cats tear it up . 
i don't know that , 
do cats bother bulbs ? 
i think more the mice or other rodents . 
oh , i see 
so if you have fresh dirt , they'll  , 
oh , they love to dig . 
i had some , uh , 
i don't know what kind they are , 
i've already forgotten , 
just regular old flower seeds 
and i planted them 
and i was so thrilled because they came up , i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place . 
and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that . 
uh , gee . 
so , i have to hang these things high , 
so they can't get to them . 
especially the catnip . 
how many cats do you have ? 
oh okay . 
actually i just , put a , uh , little fence around my yard , uh , um , which is i suppose , technically illegal , 
but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it , 
and it's got this one inch mesh 
and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out 
and i love it .
um , yeah , 
because they like to get in and fertilize things too . 
but , uh , why would it be illegal ? 
well , because we have these tow , uh , 
i live in a townhouse 
and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission . 
oh , uh , yeah , 
and , you know , they want , uh , privacy fences . 
well , yeah , if nobody complains you're all right . 
well they do walking tours too , 
but at least , because i back up to , um , a hillside where the , uh , wild animals are , i think i can probably justify it . 
um , yeah , 
and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway . 
i me , 
you know , you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property . 
the first year , the deer ate my garden , 
and i was just astounded . 
i'm going deer , right here in the city .
right here , bambi .
uh , gosh . 
and so , 
well , let's see , 
other than gardening which i fiddle at , 
i'm not very good at , 
what else do i , mostly just computer stuff . 
i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that . 
uh , cooking , that's not really a hobby , 
it's a necessity . 
but i enjoy it . 
i like to think that i'm a very good cook . 
oh , great . 
um , hobbies , 
that's about it . 
i don't have much time for hobbies , uh , between being a student and trying to run a business on the side , 
you don't have a lot of time . 
that keeps you busy . 
and raising cats . 
 i mean that could become a hobby . 
well , it started out as a hobby actually . 
uh , it developed into sort of a business , uh , you know , 
we breed them and all that , 
but , you know , we didn't really start it for the money , 
it was just , 
they were fun to have around 
and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds 
and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them , and , you know , all this kind of stuff . 
what kind of cats are they ? 
uh , i've got uh , a bombay , a turkish van and a himalayan persian . 
the  himie  is probably the sweetest one . 
she's just a little sweetheart . 
we , uh , 
the bombay had a litter , uh , last october 
and w , 
i just got her back from the vet this morning , getting her spayed . 
only going to breed them once . 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , she's not feeling too great today . 
um , is that typical , to only breed them once ? 
so they'll breed them twice a year 
and i , 
you know , they breed them before they're ready , 
uh , and , 
they do a lot of inbreeding too , 
and so you end up with , you know , kind of strange kittens . 
and i just don't like that . 
so will , you , uh , breed one of the litter , then next year ? 
um , we , 
there's not that much call for bombays . 
um , they're registered 
but uh , they're not show cats . 
oh , i see . 
uh , so all you can do is sell them as pet quality . 
uh , so what you've got is a registered pet . 
and , not too many people want bombays . 
they want things like himie persians and turkish vans . 
turkish vans , if you've never seen one , i mean , you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred . 
it's just , uh , medium size short hair cat . 
it's got , 
he's mostly white with , uh , brown and black patches . 
but they have nice personalities 
and they're very inquisitive . 
um , now the himie , we'll probably breed her a couple of times 
and we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those . 
it's just the stud fees are so much , though . 
it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her . 
we want to breed her with a champion , 
now these are long haired ? 
and the other two are short hairs . 
uh , that's nice . 
uh , she's sweet . 
going to have some nice kittens , i hope . 
uh , she's , 
if you know what a himalayan is , generally they look something like , uh , 
well they come in a lot of different colors . 
people don't realize it 
but they're sort of like , uh , siamese in a way . 
uh , they have the gloves on the paws 
and they're usually two colored . 
uh , but this one uh , is 
she's , predominantly , uh , black 
but she has chocolate , uh , paws , chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters . 
and yeah , 
she's quite attractive looking . 
hope the stud will find her attractive . 
 and that she has kittens that look like her . 
and that she has a whole bunch of kittens . 
but we have to be careful , 
uh , you know , we have to get a particular color point , uh , stud . 
you can't just breed them with anything . 
uh , we have to get a silver point himie , 
so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens . 
i see . 
that's the fun part , trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with , 
 you can't just tell them that anyway , 
that's right . 
oh dear . 
well it really sounds like , uh , uh , a business more than a hobby . 
well actually , i mean , it is a business in a way , 
but it's a lot of fun as a hobby . especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats . 
we're about to get another breed , 
we're going to buy a  devon rex  .
and i don't like  devon rexes  at first . 
what is it . 
well actually it's a mutant . 
in the county of devon . 
and they're pretty expensive , 
we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one . 
um , they're very thin , 
they're long and lanky and skinny . 
and they have real short hair . 
it's curly , as a matter of fact . 
huh , interesting . 
um , yeah , 
it's a strange looking cat . 
uh , i didn't like them at first . 
they've got great big ears , 
well thanks for being home , uh , on the weekend , 
uh , i'm actually working at night 
well sometimes i'm home 
and sometimes i'm not , 
but if i am it's always fun to talk . 
are you part of the school system out there ? 
i'm at , uh , north carolina state . 
oh is that ri , 
i had a , uh , 
i teach a course in voice i o systems . 
oh , is that right ? 
that's wonderful . 
oh , yeah , 
i talked to one , 
and i'm , 
of course , we at t i just hoping it works out that the new products that they come out will , uh , sell like gang busters , really . 
what do you think , about latin america ? 
uh , let's see , 
latin america , 
i don't know whether i have any real profound thoughts about that , 
i actually was planning a trip to latin america 
and i got warned off by some people . 
they say peru can't be traveled to 
and the crime rate in brazil makes it not a pleasant place to go and so on and so forth . 
oh , really . 
t i had a place , 
i'm not too sure , 
i don't think they do anymore , 
i think it was campinas , 
i'm not sure 
and , uh , i guess we were selling parts to the automotive industry , or whatever . 
and they had quite a few , uh , locations , 
not quite a few , several , in latin america . 
i think the one in new mexico is closed 
and i think the one in brazil is closed , 
but i don't know why that is a problem down there 
and i guess the crime rate is terrible up here too 
and , uh , an 
some people say go to new york , 
but i don't have an answer to the crime rate . 
it's sad . 
that is a sad situation . 
i'd like to go down to mexico , you know , 
and i keep hearing that , you know , the government and the crime rates pretty high too , 
that is sad .
but , uh . i think , uh , i'm kind of like you , 
i don't have any strong opinions on it . 
i guess maybe that's our biggest problem we have with our neighbors down there is that we don't have any . 
we have more , 
i guess ties , 
we in the united states have more ties to europe and everything 
and we don't really , aren't that close to everyone in south america . 
i don't really know why though . 
as bullying . 
and , uh , that's certainly from a historical point of view , would be true . 
 i mean certainly we took far more from mexico than saddam hussein ever dreamed of taking , in his wildest dreams from his neighbors . 
i know that i saw in a book , 
i was reading a spanish book , uh , not that i read spanish , you know , 
i just , you know , reading some spanish words 
and there was a comment in there about the mexicans don't really want us to say , we're americans . 
they would like to say that we're north americans because they're americans too , you know , 
and i guess that's true . 
we don't think of any one else but oursel , 
i guess , we're kind of , uh , the smart asses in the world , i suppose , uh , or of america anyway . 
we think of ourselves as the only americans , when they're americans , too . 
well i think they're going to have , 
that's a tough row for them to hoe because i think most of the world is going to regard , uh , citizens of the united states as americans and citizens of mexico as mexicans . 
as mexicans , 
 and they can stand on their heads if they want too , 
 but i don't think that they're going to change that , 
i know . 
i just don't think of mexicans as being north americans , although , i guess , strictly speaking they are . 
i mean they were saying that of us , that we're the north americans and they're americans , 
we always say we're americans , 
and they want us to say we're the north americans . 
 oh , i see .
we're not americans , 
we're north americans 
and they're south americans , 
i don't know . 
i don't want to make , 
i read it somewhere , though 
it's not my point , i guess , 
well i just don't think mexico's problems are going to be cured by semantics . 
and more money than they can pay back now 
uh , uh , so they're not exactly business men . 
i do think we should deal more with them . 
i do have a lot of sympathy in that we're here in texas , uh , 
for the language , you know , is very foolish . 
i'm relatively familiar with texas school system 
and we should teach spanish at least in , uh , grammar school , you know four or five grades of it so that we can speak spanish . 
i think that helps , when you certainly can speak their language , uh , 
and there are problems with , you know , the wet back problem , you know , 
for , everyone knows what we're talking about , 
whe , say wet back problem . 
and then we should somehow , uh , 
and i think the governments are working on that , to try to have some , uh , businesses , uh , at the borders of both sides so that to get the jobs , you know , 
there , there may be some organized way to do this . 
i do feel for them , uh , 
they are very envious of us , or they wouldn't be coming up here , you know , risking a lot . 
not that they're risking their lives , of course , but risking a lot , uh , 
getting thrown back i guess is all that , uh , happens . 
you probably don't see that . 
we see it , you know , once a month . i'm sure in san antonio they see it more often than that . 
well i grew up in los angeles . 
well you saw it out there then , too . 
and , uh , in fact , i drove a cab when i was a graduate student 
so i knew , uh , the hispanic part of l a pretty well . 
 and certainly , you know , knew that problem , 
you know , knew about apartment houses that would have eight or ten or twelve people living in them , sleeping in the same bed in shifts and all that . 
 and , uh , it was pretty wild . 
i think if you want to jump on that , is mostly , uh , poverty . 
uh , and i think a lot of their problems is poverty . 
if we could , uh , uh , 
the problems we have , is a lot of it's poverty . 
whether it's the people aren't trying hard enough to get out of poverty , that's another story , 
but , uh , uh , it is sad . 
there's so much down in all of south america , uh , so much potential , you know , 
t i , of course is really pushing world markets in their products 
and in the orient , japan and singapore now just announced building a plant in singapore , uh , 
they're in taiwan and japan 
and that much luck in south america 
and there's got to be a lot of potential for business down there , for the products certainly that we make and everything . 
 and there's got to be trade . 
i guess that's some of the answer , i guess is business , uh . uh , 
and i try to be an optimist and say , well is to get some business going between each other . 
and we need to do more of that , uh , somehow . and encourage more business ,
they've got to have a lot of resources i would think . an enormous amount of well potential that way . 
a lot of it , of course is hot and jungle and all that , 
but , uh , there's got to be a lot of potential down there . 
what are you taking in school , 
i didn't ask you that . 
well i am actually , 
oh , you're an instructor , 
you said . 
i'm the teacher , 
i give , as it were . 
that's great . 
are you teaching computer science ? 
i'm in computer science 
but of course , this project is really one to collect a data base uh , of casual speech , uh , in an attempt to get some kind of a model of what speech is like . 
of course , i work at t i 
and i'm a little puzzled as to why when they get my voice one time , why that isn't enough . 
i mean , i'm getting a kick out of the whole program 
but , uh , there's going to be i guess thousands , i don't know how many thousands , or tens of thousands of these recordings 
and i wonder how they're going to analyze them . whether it would be listening to them or analyzing , 
i gu , 
they've got to be analyzing with a voice recorder some how . 
well they record these 
and then somebody transcribes them so that they , 
and what , 
and what is said . 
 and they're able to average it over a number of different occasions because peoples voices change a lot even from morning to evening 
and that's , uh , a big problem in speech recognition . 
oh , yes . 
i know they change with age , 
i know mine uh , has changed , uh , 
although you never found , 
makes it different than what it really sounds to other people . 
uh , i'm sure singers and professional people know that , 
and you always hear your own voice in recordings and say , my god , obviously that's not me , you know . 
but , uh , i know your voice in your own head resonates a different way . 
uh , go ahead , 
you comment on it , 
i'm glad that you're in the business . 
i kno , 
t i s gotten with their speak and spell and everything , 
i've told my wife , that one of the reasons they're doing it is because eventually you'll be able to talk to your computer , 
you wouldn't have to have a keyboard , 
you'll be able to just give it commands 
and i'm sure they have some of that now , 
and not , in computers but a lot of potential , of course for handicapped people , 
i think you got it . 
uh , my first thoughts on capital punishment i , 
the first thing i want to say is no . just simply because we as human beings don't have the right to take another human being's life . 
uh , we are punishing someone for taking someone's life , 
or , in some cases , we are punishing a person for taking someone's life . 
and so in effect we are committing that same crime . 
well , it sounds like you have really strong views on it . 
and i can see that point , 
but i also have this , you know , 
i question . 
i guess i can look at it both ways . 
and just to play devil's advocate ,
our taxes are paying to feed and shelter those people . 
and it just , 
that i find very difficult to swallow ,
one thing i don't understand is the whole concept of death row . 
these people are supposedly , i guess waiting to die , 
i'm with you there . 
and there are thousands upon 
and i'm not saying that , oh , 
i guess i am kind of saying , what are we doing ? 
i mean i guess that's the same thing you were saying . 
what are we doing with these people ? 
they're there , 
we should either take some kind of action ,
but they're just , 
and then when you think of the thousands and thousands of dollars that get burned in court costs ,
 oh , exactly . 
i mean , prison is such a waste of a human being . 
it doesn't do anyone any good . 
 and i do agree with your statement that to take a human life is wrong . 
um , but , you know , 
 but act , 
 but locking someone up and not getting , you know , any benefit 
and i guess i see both sides , in that at the same time that i'm saying that , you know , we're committing the same crime , 
i also agree that , i mean , if there is somebody out there that's crazy and cruel enough 
oh , exactly w , 
there was a case in dallas , 
well , i'm sure they haven't gone to court yet , 
but , uh , apparently two teenage boys held up a taco bell . 
they put four people in a freezer and shot them all . 
now to me , that is inhumane . 
and for two people to be out in the world like that , i don't want them in my world . 
that's right . 
you understand what i am saying ? 
that's right . 
i mean , i'm not for killing anyone , 
 but i don't want these people around ,
we want a 
and we want to remove them . 
but i think that the whole crux of the problem is ,
i , think , you know , that the whole idea of , uh , the death penalty was invented for two reasons . 
it removes them from society , 
and , you know , you want to appease the people that have suffered . 
but it really doesn't take their pain away . 
and at the same time , like you said , it drains society . 
but it's a , 
i think we should be , 
the same money that we're using to build more prisons and make more prison space and keep these people in prison , that same money or half of that money could be used towards , uh , rehabilitation programs of some sort . 
but prepare them first . 
but that , 
the problem is so incredibly complex . 
i have a friend who works on the pardon and paroles 
and she interviews ,
and these people have not benefited from the stay there . 
 and there's not anything she can do to keep them in . you know , 
and those guidelines keep getting lessened and lessened because they have to do it to make the system work . 
so it's , 
and you want people out of prison 
and you want people to get jobs and , 
but they can't just walk out of prison and do that . 
that's right . 
that's right . 
there has to be some sort of buffer 
some sort of program or , 
and i know this costs money , 
but it couldn't cost any more money than we're already spending . 
i know , 
i know . 
of alternate solutions to the problem . 
how are we going to fix that , tanya ? 
 how are we going to make that happen ? 
 really , how , 
what can we do ? 
what power do we have ? 
oh , goodness . 
i mean , you know , everyone's trying to make it , you know , in their own little world . 
you know , i'm trying to make it with my job , and make , you know , myself okay and make my 
that's right . 
and it's so hard to , you know , try and be one of the movers and shakers , i guess you would call them . 
i know , 
i know . 
but it sounds like you are , uh , you know , 
oh , yes . 
and , uh , you know , when you have a voice , you do contribute , 
and i guess that's , you know , what we're meant to do . 
maybe an opportunity will come by that we will have a chance to make a real change . 
and i'm a broadcast journalist , 
and so i feel like one day i probably will write a book or something , you know , 
and some of these views 
where do you work ? 
i work at channel six , here . 
i'm a 
oh , you do ? 
that's great! 
and so , i'm pretty emotional about crime , things like that now . 
i've only been in it for a year , 
but i get 
uh , i get to see a lot of crimes , 
 and i get to see , you know , people's , uh , pain and things , 
and so when we talk about , 
most of us are so sheltered , you know . 
and a few people in the news that bring it to us 
well , that's , 
a benefit to society 
but still , you know , we can't , 
i don't know , 
i guess i would like to probably editorialize more . 
we have to just report what's happening . 
sometimes , you really want to say that , 
you really want to say what you think should be done , or how you think this court case should have gone , 
or , you know , that's a , 
you want to , you know , persuade people to your viewpoint . 
and you're right , 
that has got to be a challenge sometimes . 
especially when you are dealing with a subject like , uh , capital punishment or something or 
and you 
and you have to report both sides . 
but you really don't want to because you have your side . 
and you have to walk right down the middle with it . 
so sometimes that's hard 
i'm sure . 
well , that sounds interesting . 
 that's good . 
all right . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
i enjoyed it . 
thanks for calling . 
bye , bye . 
we're official now , 
um , it's very hot , 
in fact i've been cleaning , because i live in an apartment 
oh , okay , 
 so i can't do very much gardening other than balcony gardening 
oh , yeah . 
i have the little flower boxes with , um , a lot of different flowers , 
and i do enjoy plants , 
but i don't have a yard or anything that i can do gardening , really . 
oh , you're not the socalled ex , 
you need a house , i guess , to go through all of that . 
i have had a couple of houses , 
and , uh 
and usually they have talk shows . 
here in dallas 
 and so . uh 
so i , uh , 
for someone who doesn't garden , i'd say , that's my biggest recommendation is to , 
so you enjoy gardening ? 
oh , yeah , 
it's a lot of work . 
i'm an engineer , 
i'm with t i . 
are you with t i up there 
uh , where was , oh , 
uh , i always know that why i'm not a farmer when i garden though , 
i mean , it is dog work , 
and it is tough 
i have a lot of trees , down here , uh , 
the part i don't like , i guess , would be from december through february where you have to rake leaves 
and the wind blows all the leaves on from your neighbor after you rake yours , 
 i haven't had to plant any trees because i've got so many , 
there is some great people from texas a and m , 
i don't know , 
maybe you've heard of a and m down here , 
but there's some great , uh , folks , uh 
um . yeah , 
i'm sure it is , you know , different in the different areas . 
um , i'm originally from pennsylvania , 
and i do go home on weekends during the summer uh , and , uh , mow my mother's grass and different things like that . 
you probably have rye grass up there . 
we grow bermuda and saint augustine here . 
oh , i would have no idea .
see , you would have to learn that , though , 
no idea whatsoever . 
like i said , i'm just a balcony kind of gardener with my little flowers and my flower boxes and my herbs on 
do you have much luck in the winter , 
or freeze out because the roots are all , in the winter , uh , 
or do you have to start all over every year ? 
 well , except , i do have some , um , some day lilies that 
and they seem to come back year after year , 
and i leave them on my balcony even in 
in the same pot , 
that's amazing . 
but here we still do get some snow and ice and 
i grow a few things in pots , 
but we have to bring them in here 
everything in a pot will die 
 so , you can bring them , 
well , we do bring stuff in the garage and everything 
 but , uh , it's quite time consuming , by the way . 
i don't know how close you are to getting a house or anything , 
but it's quite , uh . 
but i would definitely do it , 
i'm all for doing everything , 
whatever subject you pick , do it the knowledgeable way 
don't go out there and start digging holes , uh , 
i agree with that . 
get some books of whether it be pennsylvania or virginia 
not your neighbors , of course , they usually know nothing 
then there's always a gardening part of the newspaper 
on saturday , 
this is saturday , 
you'll find someone , probably in the morning , i don't know 
you probably don't have to do much over there , 
the soil's probably so good 
our soil's not very good down here . 
i guess in the ice age , it's pushed a lot of , uh , limestone and everything ,
wow , uhhuh . 
 so , uh , i think all the trees that are here now were planted kind of like the johnny appleseed type trees , where people have come from , 
i'm sure the indians were here there was nothing growing in this part of dallas , 
it's so scrubby 
and i think that we even got our famous hundred year old pecan trees from alabama and all that , too 
we call them native pecan trees 
but , they grow wild here , 
they're eating pecans though .
pecans are probably not taken from virginia , 
they're probably only in the south 
it's what they call pecan pie up there in the east . 
  from pennsylvania and new jersey , 
i'm from new jersey originally . 
oh , you don't sound like it .
i've worked on that with a little chewing gum , which i shouldn't do , uh , 
go ahead , 
oh , yeah , 
that's what i'm saying , 
and i thought everybody was gardening , 
i thought , 
well , no 
i didn't tell you what our weather is like . 
it is beautiful here 
it's like eightyfive degrees here , 
it's not quite that hot . 
we've had a real nice mild spring . 
you might have seen , if you've seen the news today about all the tornados here that were 
uh , i don't know if you get c n n . 
i don't get c n n 
but it's here at work 
in fact , i'm at work today , believe it or not . 
oh , uhhuh . 
but , uh , they have t v s in the break areas 
 and there was some heavy tornados , uh , i guess in kansas , 
quite a few people were killed . 
you'll see that on the evening news . 
oh , my , uhhuh . 
but , uh , they blow through here all in the spring . 
i guess it's related somewhat to the weather , you know 
sometimes they do essentially nothing , 
and the weather men yesterday were all alert , 
say , hey , there's something really terrible going to happen , 
and they sure were right , 
but it wasn't in texas , 
it was 
look at the news tonight , 
uh , uhhuh . 
anyway , back on planting . 
uh , when did you get a house , uh , 
your trees grow up so well up there , 
but i'm sure you have plenty of trees . 
that is a key thing for shade 
i guess you have mostly pine trees , 
but where in virginia are you all ? 
um , right now , the district , 
 um , in fairfax , virginia . 
it's fifteen miles west of washington , d c . 
oh , do you have the cherry blossoms in there or not ? 
not , you know , nearly as many as what's actually in the district . 
but , um , they're definitely enjoyable . 
right now i know the azaleas and everything are out are beautiful . 
oh , yeah . 
azaleas grow all over , 
we grow those here , too , 
although again , we have to prepare the soil . 
you probably have nice big pine , 
you probably have all kinds of trees , the oaks and everything , 
that's one thing i noticed there . 
there is a vast variety here of , you know , trees , 
like , if i look out my window right now , i can see , you know , couple of pine trees , some oak trees 
have you ever been down here ? 
um , no , 
it's interesting country . 
it is wide open , uh , and flat 
 uh , and again as i said , i think when the indians were here there , there weren't any trees , 
but the civilization has brought all kinds of experiments with all kinds of trees , 
and a lot of them have done well 
 uh , they do have some pine forest areas in east texas 
but here in dallas i think they all were planted by the classical johnny appleseed , and johnny pecanseed , whatever you would call it , you know , 
there's a tremendous amount of pecan trees 
i think they thought that was going to be a great boom crop , uh , hundred and fifty years ago , because they are all over the place 
what else ? 
um , well , i guess that i really don't know that much . 
i don't have any say . 
of course , i'm a t i er , 
so i'm hoping this works . 
t i is very good , uh , has done a lot of experiments in the uh 
can't say it . 
and they've come out with some new products , 
in fact this week , they came out with some new math , uh , 
you might see them in your advertisements , uh , 
new math , uh , 
speak and math , uh , devices . 
they have had speak and spell and all that for years 
 but they've come out with some different ones 
and , uh , my wife and everyone , 
what are they going to accomplish out of all this , 
and i said , well , you're not going to have to type on the computer one day , 
you're just going to have to talk to it 
so , you , 
it's going to be much faster , of course , you know , 
the classical thing for the handicapped , too , person who can't type very fast 
like i can of course 
not that i can type very fast either 
but , uh , 
but then what about people that , um , 
that is deaf , and cannot speak . 
she can speak , 
but she can't speak very clearly 
 and she in fact is a data entry person , 
i mean she types away all day , 
well , i'll tell you why i feel so , 
i don't know a whole lot about the immigration laws . 
but i do know that in the , where i live and i teach school , there are so many orientals that have come here 
and there's a lot of mexican people too . which is not , neither here nor there , 
but the fact is that all the orientals that are here are very affluent , uh , very wise in money matters and have taken over a lot of businesses , 
and have , 
 really , ki , 
it's kind of scary because they're so bright . 
all the kids that i have that are oriental are really far above the american kids . 
and they , 
and the parents are unbelievable because they are just on the way up . 
and money is their main goal . 
and there's just oodles of them . 
and you can not believe the businesses and corporations that have been taken over by orientals . 
and you know , that they have rights too . 
and that might be the solution .
i think probably that's ,
and i was born in ohio , 
 so it really 
and there are a lot of mexican people here because we're so close to the border . 
and they are wonderful people 
 you know , i don't want to deny them their rights . 
just that you , you feel like when you were born and raised here and you worked very hard to make this country what it is , uh , it scares you when you feel like somebody's taking over . 
and a lot of these people plan one day to go back , you know , companies . 
and it's kind of scary .
 and , you know , i don't know , 
i don't know the immigration laws uh , that 
well and i do not , 
and in fact i don't know them at all . 
i don't know how many people they allow in the united states per year or if there's even a , 
i don't even know if there is a number that they allow in anymore . 
do you know anything about that ? 
i don't know . 
i lived in the middle east for sometime 
and i 
 and it seemed to take them a long time 
or there was a lot of uncertainty as to whether they would be able to come .
 and so i would guess that , you know , there are quotas for different places . 
i would think so too . 
you know , to claim , um , imminent danger 
or , i'm not sure what the terminology is . 
maybe political a , 
asylum , of some sort . 
there you go . 
you got the term . 
and maybe that's a lot of people . 
i don't know . 
to me . uh , 
with very , very good school systems . 
and they're considered , you know one of the top three in the state . both of them , you know . 
and it seems like a lot of the orientals make sure that their kids go to these schools . 
and they're head and shoulders above a lot of the kids here . 
and the kids in this area are very bright . and come from , you know , parents that are professionals or semiprofessionals and , uh , very interested in their education . 
but , uh , i think in the , last year , half or more oriental . 
and , you know , they're just extremely bright kids . 
and also they value learning . 
i was going to say , i would guess that it's not that they are any brighter , 
but they just maybe work harder 
well , i think things come easy for them too . 
but i do think that they have that work ethic that we somehow have missed the boat in with a lot of kids in the united states . 
they , uh , don't want to work for anything . 
they want it to come to them and be there 
but they don't want to work hard . 
and these kids work really hard . 
 and they have , 
but maybe part of that's the problem that here we've let this value slip . 
i know , 
i agree with that . 
and they need to have some competition . 
but what i see is y , 
the competition is there , 
but instead of meeting the challenge , they're starting to resent them . 
and it's causing , you know , i think some problems . 
well , that's too bad . 
and it's mainly black and hispanic . 
but , uh , there has been some resentment with orientals in the black community because they've started businesses there , 
and the blacks resent them coming in and taking their money , 
and there's been some violence because of it . 
oh , that's really sad . 
it is . 
so , you know , i really , 
welcoming everyone 
and even when i was younger when i was in college , i was a member of the n a a c p because i lived up north , 
and i was very into the human rights part of everything . 
but i've become very cynical 
well , and it sounds like you feel that there is need for change . 
maybe uh , you know , the e , 
there is too big of a concentration coming all at once to allow for adequate melting into the society . 
well , and exactly , 
that's exactly true . 
plus the fact that these people do come for a short period of time . two , two , three , four maybe five years and then go back . and pick our brains , which is wonderful , and take all that back with them . 
and , uh , plus a lot of american dollars . 
but in the long run maybe that's going to make a better world too . 
 you know , you just don't know . 
and yet , you know , uh , with , uh , 
there's somebody on my other line 
but i'm going to ignore 
uh , anyway i just , 
you really don't know what to do . 
and i don't , 
i want my kids to have values where they're accepting and so forth . 
and both of my children are really hispanics than they are of the orientals ,
they feel , you know , like they've taken over . 
they feel like , uh , you know , they're taking some of the rewards that they should have . 
and i really don't want that to happen . 
and i think a lot of their friends feel the same way too . 
and i really do wish i knew about quotas and really wish i 
i would suspect that they have . 
well , i guess , um , i don't have much , much more to contribute to the topic . 
i don't really either . 
i wish i knew more . 
probably if i did , i might be a little bit more , uh , tolerant ,
 and i , 
and even if i really wish i knew the situations they were going back to or coming from . 
you don't know any of that 
and you feel , you know , you can't put yourself in their shoes or really understand them . 
and for some reason orientals are very , uh , 
my good friend calls them pushy , 
but i call them very , that 
they know what they want 
and they go get it . 
and in stores and so 
goal directed . 
but in stores and things , sometimes they can be very impolite because they get in front of you 
i see . 
you know , just going for it , they take it quickly . 
and , uh , they don't think anything of that . 
and i don't , you know , 
that's makes people resentful too . 
and so , 
and i know that . 
but sometimes it's gets touchy . 
and i'm sure it's a lot different , 
you're from maryland ,
what part of maryland are you from ? 
up in the gaithersburg area . 
oh , okay . 
my sister used to live there , 
and i'm sure that it's a lot different there . 
uh , it's a lot different in iowa than it is here . 
 well , no . 
is that right ? 
and with some of the same problems that you've mentioned . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i guess i wasn't involved enough to , uh , really stop to think about it . 
well , see it . 
and i feel 
and i love the example that most of these children give our american children . 
and yet , you know , i can see why some of the parents are fearful too . 
and it's a kind of a touchy situation . 
and i wish that we could all just learn from each other and not feel threatened . 
so anyway , 
well , it was good talking to you . 
 and i h , 
and have a good trip in california . 
and have a good weekend . 
all right . 
well thank you . 
all righty , 
do you have any , uh , ideas on universal health insurance ? 
do you have any strong opinions ? 
you do ? 
 uh , i think , well given that there are so many people who don't have health insurance . it's probably a real smart thing ,
i mean , you hear these horror stories of people , homeless people going to the hospital and , 
and we will worry about who he is later 
i feel like there should be some kind of coverage made , 
but i'm really leery of a , kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan , because i just feel like everything that the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly 
and it is going to be about six times more expensive . 
i know , that's certainly true . 
but , i wonder about like in canada . 
in canada , where everybody , uh , everybody automatically has insurance in canada . 
and they have that in england too , 
but i think that it's a pretty poor , 
they get a lot lower quality care than we do . 
now , i know some people don't agree with me , 
but , uh , i know you have to wait real long time to get , certain surgeries that aren't emergency , 
and you don't have the kind of choices that we have here , 
 and , uh , i've worked a lot in doctor's offices and hospitals 
and i really don't want to give up having those choices . 
that's true . 
i think , 
i mean , there is a night and day difference between good doctors and bad doctors , and good hospitals and bad hospitals . 
that's true , 
and in england , at least at the time when i was familiar with it , about ten years ago , they just told you what day you had to show up and where you had to show up and who your doctor was going to be . 
oh , you 
so didn't get any choices at all ? 
oh , that's a problem . 
because i know even among , 
even now , the way we have it now , there are still . 
it's getting worse , 
isn't it ? 
i mean i picked a primary care physician and just didn't like him , you know . 
i had to switch because i just thought he was a quack . 
that's exactly the problem , 
there's just so many , such variation 
and it's , 
but see , i guess , what they had in england , and i guess in canada is socialized medicine . 
so maybe , that's like the extreme of it . 
do you think ? 
and what that i think that tends to do though is i think that tends to , 
it probably has two , a good and a bad side ,
 so you wind up getting the people who really want to be doctors , being doctors , 
really want to . 
so i will go into medicine . 
you don't get those . 
or that , 
or people also get the feeling that , well jeez , you know , you have a lot of job security there , 
and it's more of , uh , seniority , i would imagine kind of thing , instead of having a skill or whatever to advance , 
that's true . 
 so you don't necessarily get the kind of quality control or the kind of , 
i don't know . 
it would be nice to see something where at least , 
i think we have to have something . 
we really do . 
and then , 
i know , 
i don't know , 
having worked in doctor's offices and stuff i see it from a physician's point of view . 
and i , 
 oh , yeah . 
and i think hospitals do make money , but not nearly as much as insurance companies . 
oh , right . 
i think they are really making a killing and nobody is talking about it . 
they are the ones who make , 
i mean they are the ones , 
they have , you know , the   although , 
i mean , it's 
the unfortunate part of that is that the people , i think , tend to forget that doctors are humans as well . 
so that 
insurance companies have to charge a substantial amount for certain people , or certain types you know , it could be millions , i mean , unfortunately . 
and if the doctor , whether , it was , you know , 
i mean i'm sure there are those cases where the doctor is wrong or malicious or something . 
but you know their , you know . 
their mistakes are made . 
everybody makes mistakes , unfortunately . 
it shouldn't be a billion dollar , you know , industry . 
and this is their compensation . 
so , yeah , 
i think that's the legal part of it coming into it to . 
that is a big problem . 
i wonder if we should have a limit on how much people can sue for . 
that would be nice . 
or ,  , i don't know because then that's where the insurance company , 
it would be a lot better . 
 i mean i'm sort of in a government run medicine program . 
sort of . 
i'm in a , 
are you ? 
well , well i'm a graduate student . 
and , uh . 
at where ? 
 oh , okay . 
i'll bet you are in texas . 
i'm in texas 
i was going to bet that , 
uh , yeah , 
oh , great . 
and because the university offers me two plans . 
they offer what they call the mandatory version ,
and , they don't , 
and even though my wife's insurance covers me ,
oh , no . 
and that's for the mandatory portion of the insurance . 
that can't be legal . 
i'm not actually sure if it is or not 
but , people sort of keep fighting it 
and i'm , 
and i mean to keep fighting it , 
 oh , my gosh . 
 but you know , it's just one of these things where i just don't want to spend my time . 
how can they make you pay for insurance coverage ? 
well , the reason , 
their rational it keeps the cost of university health services down , 
and everyone can use it . 
you know it . 
how does it keep the cost down ? 
because everyone is now forced to pay for this . 
and there is like an , 
oh , so they just use the money for something else besides your insurance policy ? 
well , no , 
well , yeah , 
we have a , 
so you're subsidizing the hospital . 
obviously , we're paying for the welfare state . 
we can do that . 
oh , good . 
so , in , 
but in effect , i'm paying twice for one service . 
you are 
i know . 
and see that's the thing , 
now that i'm in my thirties now , and i have three kids 
and i mean , i'm very liberal . 
i'm extremely liberal , 
and , uh , i , 
but now i just in the last couple of years . i have gotten to the point where i am saying i just cannot afford to pay anymore ,
i want to keep helping people out 
but i need for the government or the agencies , to find a way to do it on the amount of money , you know , that i can afford . 
i just can't afford anymore . 
it's just outrageously . 
it's just starting to get me angry , 
and for the first time in my life . i am starting to feel like i . 
i mean , if i can't afford to have some kind of optional operation for myself . 
because our medical coverage has gotten increasingly worse over , let's see , the past five years , to the point now where even if we need surgery , our insurance only covers eighty percent of it . 
which is ridiculous . 
and , right 
and so no matter what happens to me , if i get in a car accident this afternoon , i have you know , no way of being able to afford the outrageous medical costs ,
what if we decide to have universal health insurance , 
i'm subsidizing , 
everybody else . 
and i am paying for it . 
you know , stuff like that has happened with education and with other things that you hear about 
and it's just , wait a minute .
you know , my kids aren't getting that . 
how come their kids are getting that ? 
i don't , uh . 
and i know it's only in a few cases 
and i don't want them uh , to cut funding for welfare programs or anything . 
i don't want them to do that , because i know a lot of people , they live right on the edge 
and they need that . 
it's one of the strange , 
i think it's strange that as you get older . 
i think the tendency is that as people get older ,
well , yeah , 
and uh , it's funny because a couple of years ago , i heard a quote from winston churchill . 
let's see if i can remember it , 
anybody who's not a liberal in his twenties has no heart , 
and a person who is not a conservative in his fifties has no brain . 
it was something like that .
that's probably very true . 
and i don't know , 
i guess that's what's happening to me , 
but i think it's just starting , uh , 
i don't know maybe other people , 
or maybe this is just my own personal . 
i mean everywhere you look , you are getting something new . 
i mean , you start off ,
we have federal income tax .
so on top of the federal tax on gasoline ,
so we are just . 
but i tell you , uh , we have incredible property taxes down here . 
oh , that could be , uh , making up for the difference . 
and we don't have the services either that other states have . 
probably some of that is divorce 
and some is they're more educated than they used to be i think . 
uh , i think sometimes , uh , leaders in government they've become more , uh , adroit in that area , too , instead of just men all the time . 
we have more women in government . 
well , uh , i probably a little bit older than you are , 
so what i see , uh , is , 
the change that i see the most went to college . 
when i went to college you could be a teacher or maybe a nurse or a secretary , 
but there were very few women in business at that time . 
a few , 
but they were the oddity . 
very limited . 
and now i see 
and i see for my daughter , which is wonderful this , 
she's thirteen 
and i see a whole wonderful world out there that she can choose from , 
so many different jobs , which i think is terrific . 
because i'm a teacher 
and , i mean , i love teaching , 
but , i think there are a lot of other things i would have liked better . 
and , uh , not that i would give the career up because it's a safe career , plus , because i always have a job plus i am a single parent , too , 
 and i need the income . 
have started to work , too , is because economically it's just a must . 
i think that's right . 
uh , you just , 
it's very difficult to get along on one income unless  , uh , the male , uh , has an extraordinarily good job . 
and especially men who teach school , they don't make that much money , 
and most all , 
they always either have 
they're either moonlighting or else their wife works , too . 
uh , it's just an economic need now . 
i really think women have so much more responsibility you know , as far as everything . 
oh , definitely . 
the average today of having a single family , you know , with the mother as the head ,
 oh , yes , 
we have quite a few teachers at our school that are single parents 
but still there's a lot more than there used to be . 
and see you never picture yourself in a situation like this . 
when i married , i thought i'd be married the rest of my life . 
i'm really grateful that i went to college . 
i have a twin sister 
and we were eleven when he died 
and she had a nursing degree , 
 and she was able to make it . 
but , she said you never know what's going to happen 
and i thank god that i did go to college and got a degree because otherwise i don't know how i would be able to raise my children . 
you know , isn't that funny , uh , because the same thing happened to us , except i was twelve . 
and my mother had a nursing degree and was able to make it in her profession , 
isn't that something . 
 and was , 
and even today i think the chance for education is so much , uh , better for all of our girls ,
 oh , yes . 
but the girls especially . 
i do , too . 
but i think it needs to continue to change 
and there's still not equality as far as , uh , paychecks for men and women . 
i think that we still have a long way to go . 
a lot of things , 
and the executive jobs ,
if they want to dedicate they can do it . 
and i also think that in the future that , uh , it's going to continue . 
we're not going to see a lax off of women in the work force . 
i think they're going to stay there 
and i think that's the way it should be . 
i think it  , 
oh , i think so . 
i mean , not that i think that i'm equal to men because there's a lot of things that men can do that i , could never do strength wise and so forth 
 but , also there's some things women can do like have children ,
so , you know , it , 
i don't want to be equal 
but , i want to get what i deserve 
and i want to be able to be on the same level with them . 
if i can do a job as well as i man i think i should get the same pay , you know . 
i really am not . 
but that we have just as many rights as they do . 
and i feel like if there's a qualified woman to do the job and if she's good or better than a man then they should get the job with the same pay . 
that's right . 
and i think that is happening more and more . 
i do , too . 
i think it's just going to take a little bit longer . 
oh , i do , too . 
well , great , 
well , it was good to talk to you . 
all right . 
um , i don't have any , i guess , definite views about elderly care . 
um , the first thing that comes to mind is kind of those horror movies that you see ,
i think that's one thing that i would look at if i was putting my grandmother or my mother , uh , in some sort of home . 
i agree with you . 
i , um , 
a group that i'm a part of goes once a month to um , they call it the heritage house . 
it's a nursing home for elderly people . 
and this particular one has people that are in pretty bad shape . 
and , um , i watched , 
the interesting thing was i watched this particular one change hands . 
it started out just being a terrible place for the people , 
 and then a new company bought it ,
hired new nurses and , uh , just redid it , you know . 
just out of curiosity , what kinds of things were they doing when they were considered a bad place ? 
well , to me , it was dirty , for one thing . 
uh , when you would walk in , the smell was just ,
um , there were a lot of people just kind of up and down the halls laying in their beds hollering and , you know , crying , 
oh , my goodness . 
of course , i don't know how many of them were , you know , not in their right mind .
in pain or something . 
i just really don't know , 
but i feel like they were neglected . 
and , um , yeah , 
that was what i was going to say . 
it sounds like just neglect all over . 
you know , neglect to cleanup . 
i don't really think anyone was being , you know , cruel or , 
i just think they were not doing anymore , you know , than they had to do . 
and , um , just kind of letting everybody live in a not very good environment .
but this new company came in 
and like i said , they remodeled the place . 
and it smells nice when you walk in . 
and it looks nice . 
and they got like several new color t v's for the people ,
they made a little patio area where they can go outside . 
that's great . 
just , you know , small things that make it seem a lot more homey . 
and it's a lot more like an apartment place instead of just , uh , 
i would personally hate to know that my mother or grandmother or anyone is in a home like that . 
and my biggest fear is that they would be lonely . 
and i would like to know that there are , you know , just a lot of activities , like you said , you know , just putting a plant in a room ,
they can go outside 
and , just to know that they're not , you know , laying in a room ,
i'd like to know that , you know , they have friends there , 
and they have little conversations and things . 
i'd like to know there's a lot of interaction and ,
i don't know how they would do that . 
well , they , uh , 
this place that we visit , it's really neat . 
everyday , they have schedules of groups that come in . 
and they will do bingo . 
our group does a church service once a month . 
and then other groups come in and do the services , you know , other sundays , 
so that they have at least one service every sunday . 
so there are a lot of things . 
there are places that have a lot of things for them to do . 
but you really do have to kind of seek it out , you know , 
i didn't realize that there were groups that go in like that . 
it is . 
it's real nice . 
and , um , i know our church does it 
and there are a lot of other churches , 
and they are just like civic organizations ,
and , uh , i have other friends . 
it's kinds of neat , they take animals over and let the people pet them . 
like they also have a dog that maybe needs a home 
and they will wash it all up ,
that's great . 
that will be something , you know , they would look forward to if they knew , you know , that the puppy is coming on wednesday . 
you know , that would be something to look for . 
that's really neat . 
that really is . 
i thought that was a real unusual thing ,
so , yeah , 
there's a lot that can be done . 
it's just a matter of people not being lazy . 
and , you know , doing the best they can . 
again , i don't know what i'd do if it was my own mother or grandmother ,
putting any of my family in an elderly home , to me would be the very last resort . 
you know , it , um , 
and i know it's hard for a lot of families if you're trying to work or trying to take care of your own family ,
and i know that's hard sometimes 
i would feel so guilty . 
i would , too . 
i don't know . 
i know . 
i know what you mean . 
i don't know anyone personally that's in an elderly home . 
well , i have interesting conversations with a lot of these people because , um , many of them , of course , their minds are not good . 
and so a lot them have told me exactly the same story , you know , 
and then the next time i go it's the same thing , you know , 
uh , just seems to make them really feel good . 
nod your head and smile at them . 
i'll tell you the people i feel the sorriest for , 
there's a guy at this particular one i go to ,
 but he has cerebral palsy so bad that he just cannot communicate . 
and , um , he's blind 
and he has seizures , you know , 
i mean , he's just like in a world of his own , 
and yet he wants so much ,
and if you come over to him , if he can touch your hand , he'll grab it and kiss it . 
oh , and he's always got a smile . 
i mean , he really tries to , brighten up your life . 
oh , it's just amazing . 
but he can't say anything . 
he can just kind of make noises . 
that's something , that , if i had to work in an elderly home , i don't think i could do it . 
like i would really like to be a teacher , 
but i don't think i could do it . because i'm very , very emotional . 
me , too . 
and i mean , the minute something happens , 
i cry on , i mean , hallmark commercials . 
i know . 
that's just the end of me . 
i know . 
and so i mean something real life , i just , 
i interview a lot of children , 
i'm an education reporter , 
 and i always go and do an education things . 
i meet these kids who are , you know , dropping out of school left and right . 
and all the sudden , they're in this program . 
they're making straight a's , 
they're going to graduate early , 
 and i just want to hug them ,
and , you know , i could just imagine , you know , working in a home like that , 
oh , yeah . 
and those people , they're so sweet and , 
and all they want is just for everything to be happy , 
 you know , 
oh , it does . 
it is , 
it's really hard 
i have a three year old and a six year old , 
 and they , um , have gotten comfortable being around these people ,
 and the people love them . 
i'm sure . 
and they want the children , you know , to hug them or hold their hand 
and , so far , my kids will do it . just real easily , 
 and i think it's because they've gone since they were real little , 
 and they've never been afraid . 
but that's something , 
to me children ,
people need to take groups of children ,
i want to see her .
i would love to hold her . 
and children , 
i mean , usually a   of elderly people they like to , uh , share their experiences with the , 
they'll be telling them all kinds of stories .
that's true . 
you know , they feel like they've lived life 
so they need to share it . 
and i'm sure i'll be like that , too . 
well , me , too . 
it's quite an experience . 
but , that's great . 
i didn't know there were such groups . 
there are . 
and , uh , it really helps those people , i think . 
but , like you said , i'd really have a lot of second thoughts before i put any of my own family members there . 
it would be a last resort . 
and i would hate it if anyone put me in one . 
oh , i know . 
i'm always afraid like , oh , 
what if i lose my mind . 
am i going to end up in a place like that  ? 
 somebody take care of me . 
that's right . 
well , nice to talk to you . 
you , too ,  tonya  .
thanks for calling . 
 so have you got a pet . 
my kids would love a pet . 
i had a pet when i was a girl . 
i had a cocker spaniel . 
and i think one thing about pets is they're a lot of company . 
you can tell them anything 
and they won't tell anybody . 
that's right , 
that's like unconditional affection . 
as a matter of fact , i was thinking that same thing , unconditional love . 
they just give it ,
anyway , do you have a pet ? 
i've had several cats . 
my pet , uh , was hit by a car new year's eve , 
but , uh , 
i'm going to get another one as soon as i get back in town . 
i'm going out of town this weekend , 
when i get back i'm going to find a cat . 
but that's good that you're going to get another one . 
i know some of my friends who have pets , uh , 
and they just are really , you know , 
the ones that have dogs are very , uh , protective of them 
and i think that's one reason they have them , especially older people that i know , that have pets . 
but they just , um , really take care of them , or , uh , are protective of them . 
i work and go to school 
and it's kind of nice 
you come home wants a little food a little attention . 
and my kids , 
 and that's , 
it's kind of fun . 
um , they really want a dog badly , 
and they've been looking and looking 
and want , you know , 
they'd take anything i think  , 
but , um , i don't know do you like , 
i guess your cat was an indoor cat . 
it kind of traveled around 
 travel  .
well yeah , 
i don't care for the smell of the litter box 
so my cat was trained to go outside , 
other than that it was inside when it wanted to be , it was outside when   .
when i had a cocker spaniel it was an outdoor dog 
and , uh , i think i liked that better . 
i , think , you know , 
i like dogs , 
but i think that , uh , 
kind of like big dogs 
and you have to have room for them . 
that's true . 
and dogs take a lot more care than cats do . 
cats are pretty independent , you know , 
you feed them 
and they keep themselves clean 
and , if you , 
that's true . 
take them for walks , 
i see all the people on sunday going for a walk with their dogs 
i'm kind of skeptical with my son getting a dog , 
i'm like i know it will be fun the first week maybe , 
and then mom gets to take care of it , or something . 
so , i gue , 
i got to take care of a friend of mine's dog . 
he's just got a puppy 
and he was out of town last weekend 
and of course the dog is not trained for anything yet , 
so it was , go over there and clean up after the dog , 
oh , that's exciting . 
and , uh , kids kind of , 
not the work . 
i think it's really important to that if you get a pet that they're either spayed or neutered so that , you know , we're not just going on with this pet population and having to ,
that kind of gripes on me some , 
but i don't know . 
 well if you're going to have a pet , 
more and more people are , 
and i think ,
but , uh , 
when i was growing up we had cats 
and , you know , just seeing to experience as a kid and understand , 
i think that's really true . 
and it was a real positive thing , 
but on the other hand you don't want to , be one of these people that dumps the kittens off on the side of the road , you know , 
they're , getting old now , 
and it's time to get rid of them . 
i think our community is a lot more conscious now though too , 
and that's good too . 
well , i think that's all i have to say . 
have a good night . 
all right , 
what kind of ex , 
do you have children ? 
oh , okay . 
and we had kind of a hard time finding someplace   we could put michael's  goods   , 
his birthday is the first of september , 
 and he was going to school at five . 
so , he started the first grade when he was five 
and you had trouble finding somewhere for him to be before he was five . 
 so , we could , you know , 
we tried to find him someplace where he could learn something . 
and it was , uh , 
it wasn't really that expensive , 
 but it's really hard to find someplace where you can send your child and expect him to learn something . 
to learn something . 
and i mean , that's 
 , even not only toddlers but , you know ,  even  your older children . 
it's hard to find anywhere they're really going to learn something . 
and then , yeah , 
you do have to pay , you know , if you , 
the better the place , the more you're going to pay . 
but parents pay when they stay home with them anyway .
very true . 
you know , my wife works 
so . we try to , 
if i had any children a lot of people ,
see i don't know , 
i work in the news business 
and i just see different things all the time , 
 and people are just crazy these days . 
they're crazy 
it takes me a long time to just trust someone as a friend ,
well , see we took our time 
and we checked it out , 
 and we found a preschool for him . 
and it , you know , 
through other folks where i work , 
i work at t i . 
so , through other folks where we worked we found a nice preschool 
it was actually at a licensed preschool ,
we , had those requirements , 
i guess that's the best way , you know , to get ,
i know , 
and , you know , i don't think i would have left him anywhere that would , 
i would have stayed home with him first ,
they still have unlicensed babysitters running around up here 
you know , i think it's out of sight or out of mind ,
i mean you've got to be sure , 
i mean not that they're going to abuse your child or anything ,
 but you never know . 
just simple things ,
 but you , you know , 
you don't know who you can trust ,
then you hear so much , you know , on the news about , uh , child care places 
and also , um , senior care facilities , you know , you hear abuse . 
senior care , is getting real bad . 
and so you just don't know , 
and you almost want to , you know , spend a couple of weeks in class with your child just to see how it is or something . 
so , you have no children at all . 
do you miss that part in your life 
uh , no , 
 um , it's just not in the cards for me right now 
i'm trying to get my career going . 
i imagine , 
working in the news production , 
 anyway back to the subject , 
we should have discussed this earlier , 
 but anyway , it's tough , 
it really is , 
it's hard to find good child care , 
 and it's hard to find someplace where you can leave your child and trust that he's ,
and you brought up a good point , you know , 
you just don't want a babysitter 
you would hope that maybe they'd come home and know some of their a b c's or something , you know , 
get them , 
you know , and he's doing real well , 
it has paid off for him . 
he's in first grade now , 
 and he's , you know , got a second grade reading level and a fourth grade math level . 
so , you know , those early ages you know , when his mom and dad are at work ,
there's a lot people at work that would have babysat him but sending him to a preschool where he actually learns something ,
his attitude is i think a little bit ,
you know , but his , 
did you take this same , uh , route with your other two children ? 
um , they were outside my marriage , 
 so , i don't know . 
i was wondering how , 
i would say , no , 
they're really good , 
 and i guess , no , 
he learns from the older boys too 
and it helps that he has older brothers , uh , 
like , uh , in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys , 
but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have another woman in the house for my wife to share , 
but , you know , 
 so , we faced that too 
he learned quite a bit not only from nursery school 
but he learned quite a bit from the older boys , 
 and , you know , he's excelled 
and it's paying off for him , 
it really is . 
that's excellent . 
sometimes he's a little bit smart mouthed , 
 but  , you know . 
well , what kid isn't  ,
but i think it's really nice to know that you can find someplace , 
i don't know , you know , how it is down there in waco , 
 but in lubbock we have a few that you can send your children to 
and they can actually learn something instead of just being babysat . 
do they have any kind of program like at t i or wherever your wife works , um , 
huh , because i know they're putting that into a lot of , uh , corporations now . 
they're trying to . 
the federal government is trying to  intercede  on that too , 
 so , no , 
so , maybe that will be an option for , 
well , it would be nice , you know , there , 
but then i foresee that being just a babysitting thing not much learning but , you know , 
there's not , 
you know , there was different teachers all the time , you know , 
and then some substitute teachers in the afternoon , 
 and they actually taught him something instead of just watching him all day . 
you know , and then   they had a group of kids 
and they put on skits 
and they put on plays , 
 and they did the halloween thing ,
and you know , it was important to us , 
 so you know , we took a good look at it and made sure it was going to go that way . 
do you think it would have been better for him to have , um , maybe one continuous teacher , somebody that he could , uh , 
or is it better the other way with a lot of different , 
i don't think he needed to be attached to too , even though he did , 
 you know , he attached himself to a couple of those , 
 but i think his attachments at home 
and , you know , he gets the idea of what school is for 
and this person can teach me one thing and this person teach me another 
and , no , 
he did well , 
each child is individual ,
but i don't have that experience , 
so , i can't say that ,
so , i don't think we made too many mistakes . 
well , it sounds good , 
we tried hard . 
sounds like he's doing real well . 
he's doing real well . 
and he learned from it 
and that was the most important thing that we wanted was for him to learn not just to sit there and be babysat all day . 
you know , maybe i'll clean my house , maybe i'll cook you lunch ,
and they'll probably sit him in front of the television ,
and you know , 
but we had a good experience , 
 and we really did well . 
well , that's good , 
he served better than we did , you know , 
he actually gained from it , you know , 
sure we gained from it ,
but i think in the long run he gained from it just being somewhere where we learned something ,
that's great . 
and it's important . 
that's probably what i'll try and look for whenever i do have my children , 
i don't know when that will be , 
 but , um , you know , just really look into , 
it will take me a long time to find somewhere i'm sure ,
well , you know , his mom didn't go back to work until , you know , when he was six months old . 
and we just didn't want to dump him somewhere ,
and we wanted his center of attention at home 
and it worked out real well , 
i'm glad ,
it's difficult these day , 
it's a lot more difficult these days because you have both parents working a lot of times , 
 oh , yeah , 
 and , so , you have to find day care ,
most of the time now it's a necessity , 
you can't afford , 
 so , you know , i'm not making seventy or eighty thousand dollars a year 
no choice , 
so child care's a necessity , whereas years ago , you know , the husband basically worked and the wife ,
 and , you know , i'm forty now 
but , you know , when i was a kid mom was always at home . 
so , we didn't , 
i think that has a lot to do with is breaking , you know , 
it is , 
the basic family is not there anymore . 
i'll agree with that , it is . 
i think that plays a big part in a child's learning and , you know , what they can and cannot do in child care . 
i don't think , 
well let's start with you .
okay , um , 
the last movie i saw was the five heartbeats 
and i liked it a lot because it had a lot of music in it . 
five heartbeats ? 
who was in that . 
um , i don't know all the actors or anything , 
but it was a lot of music a lot of old songs , things like that . 
when was it out ? 
um , it's still out now , uh , 
it came out i guess about a month or , about a month and half ago , something like that . 
it's about a black singing group . 
and , uh , it was called the dells , 
and , uh , it was kind of like just about their , 
and , uh , that was pretty good . 
i enjoyed , 
i saw dances with wolves . 
have you seen that ? 
that was pretty good . 
uh , that won best picture , i think . 
and costner got best director . 
right now kevin costner , i mean , he's starring in everything . 
he's doing the kennedy movie that's coming out , um , 
and there's one , 
another kennedy movie , huh .
and let me see , 
what else . 
um , he's doing some other movie , 
i can't , 
i think robin hood , that's it , 
the robin hood coming out 
and he's going to be in also . 
and , let me see , 
what else have i seen . 
what have you seen ? 
one comes to mind here 
and i not sure about the name , has meryl streep 
and , um , what was the name of that ? 
anyway the ba , 
the premise of the story is that , uh , uh , uh , after you die you go to a place called judgment city . 
oh , i know what you're talking about . 
and , um , anyway , 
uh , i can't remem , 
the other actor , uh , 
it's called reviewing my life , or something like that . 
and , uh , 
i didn't get to see that . 
that's it , 
and it's an excellent movie ,
it's pretty entertaining , uh . 
let's see , 
what else have i seen lately , um . 
one of my favorite movies , it's not one that i haven't seen , 
i , w , 
it's not a late movie . 
home alone . 
it's probably my all time , 
well not all time favorite , 
but one of my favorites ,
well , did you ever see home alone ? 
i heard it was really good , 
i've just haven't gone out to see it . 
that was a good one , too . 
was that pretty funny ? 
and , um . 
somehow just never made it to see that , 
but i need to see it . 
  i can't believe i'm just drawing a blank , because , i've s , 
fatal attraction , i don't know why i like that movie so much , 
i guess it was so much suspense . 
and i like suspense . 
that kind of reminds me 
like , uh , did you ever see , this is going way back , uh , jagged edge . 
that was a good one too , 
certainly is . 
but , uh . 
and i liked the woman that played in that , 
i forgot what her name is now . 
anne archer she was the wife in fatal attraction , 
oh , okay . 
and she played in , uh , narrow margin which was a little more recent , 
and that was kind of another suspense type , alfred hitchcock type thriller . 
that was good . 
uh , god , i guess i haven't seen too many movies lately . 
i need to , 
i haven't seen a whole lot either , 
i mean it's hard for me to get to movies now because it's getting so expensive , you know , 
i'd rather rent . 
i know 
 , it's obnoxious ,
but then you end up spending another six dollars on food . 
and that's just for a bucket of popcorn , you know . 
and a pop , you know , 
so it gets pretty , 
god forbid you should want something to drink with it , 
but , uh . 
like if i , 
so if i take a date ,
oh , yeah 
and , uh , i don't know . 
and go to dinner or something with that . 
i was going to say , you know , you can find certain restaurants that are nice ,
it's almost more fun really , 
it's almost more fun really to rent movies . you know , just kind of stay at home , maybe . 
the problem is you always have to wait until they're out . 
that's true too . 
so that's what you're , uh , dealing with . 
but then you can make your popcorn and you know , be comfortable . 
that's true , 
well that's about all the movies i've seen recently .
i ought to open the paper here because i know i've seen a few that have played . 
but , um , i just can't come up with any names here , 
haven't , haven't been to one for a little while , 
but , um . did you ever see kindergarten cop ? 
that was pretty good . 
was that arnold schwarzenegger ? 
but , um . 
there's a movie i do want to see , uh , 
i haven't seen it , 
what is it , oh , 
kiss before dying . 
whose in that ? 
it looks pretty suspenseful . 
another one i saw is called the object of beauty . 
i don't recommend that ,
but , it was all right , kind of funny . 
 um , but , um , what else has been on and about . 
are you looking in the paper ? 
i'm trying to , 
i wanted to get to the silence of the lambs , 
i hear that , 
oh , yeah , 
that was great . 
oh , did you see that ? 
that was an excellent movie . 
it was pretty scary because i was visiting a v a hospital , uh , near to where i live 
and they were saying that some of the patients there , you can't leave by themselves , because they'll make a weapon out of anything , you know , 
out of a piece of paper , they can kill somebody , you know . 
and this guy in silence of the lambs hannibal lector , he was that kind of person , 
and you , 
they couldn't leave him alone 
it was really fas , 
he was very dangerous , 
but you were kind of on his side because he was so fascinating . 
but they couldn't leave him alone at all . 
and they found out what happened when they did leave him alone one time , 
but i won't tell you that , just in case you see the movie . 
i'll probably try to see it in a little while here . 
oh very good . 
but it's been out for a while . 
oh yeah , 
i'm not sure when it will be hitting video stores , 
it should be a while yet , though . 
have you heard anything on , like , out for justice . 
but i don't like steven seagal things , uh , 
has he had very many other movies out ? 
and there was one right before that with a similar title 
like , uh , i don't know , some macho title . 
that's why , i , 
because it's a macho movie . 
it is , 
i don't like that a lot . 
i don't watch a lot of arnold schwarzenegger or anything like that either . 
speaking of that i think terminator two is supposed to be out . 
that might be good , though , 
i don't know , 
i've enjoyed a lot of his movies , 
uh , they're action filled , and a little bit of humor , 
and , uh . 
i guess , i'm not fond of the action packed movie ,
or , you know , 
i like the movies that make you think . 
did you ever see , um , um , sleeping with the enemy ? 
and that's something i really should have seen . 
was that good , 
did you see it ? 
i just remember when it first came out that it had kind of mixed reviews . 
a friend of mine saw it 
and she said it was okay ,
it wasn't anything spectacular . 
you expect more out of , uh , julia roberts , though . 
the previews looked so good that i wanted to see it 
but i never did , uh . 
did you ever see the original f x movie . 
and i remember i was in school , i saw half of it 
and i fell asleep 
and everyone else watched it .
 oh , okay , 
because i was going to say i always enjoyed that , 
uh , i remember that movie , 
and , uh , it was , 
i mean i got in to it , 
i don't know if , 
i really need to go see the original one , 
i'm sure it was a good movie , 
i probably had a test that day , or something , 
i don't know . 
it was one of those that has a lot of twists in it , 
it's , uh , 
i can't put it exactly on the lines of the jagged edge , 
you get these twists 
and , it's usually pretty good , 
but , uh . 
i think though , that movies are losing their luster . 
what's that ? 
i think , 
i don't know , 
because of the cost 
and , i think it's just losing its originality or something . 
i don't , 
i can't pinpoint it . 
but it doesn't seem like it's as big , uh , rage to get the movie theater as it used to be . 
that's probably true . 
just you see the same story lines , different characters 
it's hard to say . 
and i know i don't , 
you , know , i don't keep up with it ,
but , uh , i don't try to 
it does cost a lot , 
so why go out and see something right away , you know , 
you kind of wait 
and if something gets really good reviews , maybe you'd finally go spend the twelve bucks ,
but , um , you know , i haven't been to an opening for , oh , you know ages ,
i guess we're set . 
i get my current events basically from news , uh , just because i watch ,
television news ? 
i watch a little bit of everything . 
i like to tune to c n n because , uh , you know , you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on ,
i think news today , um , it's kind of losing its importance . 
like on radio , if you hear any news at all , it's like two seconds . 
you know , really quickly ,
on commercial radio , i guess , i tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work ,
that's good , too , 
i like k r l d . 
but i do here . 
where do you go to school ? 
uh , university of texas at dallas . 
oh , okay . 
i went to u t at austin . 
but , uh , i'm a news reporter 
so from the t v . 
but , um , 
i do tend to throw on headline news when i'm doing things around the house and just let it play ,
but , uh , 
i usually don't intentionally . although i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news . 
or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news . 
if it comes on , i just happen to hear it . 
now , i will intentionally buy a newspaper to look at the news . 
but other , 
all i ever get out of the paper is a sunday paper 
that's true . 
 that's about it . 
the sunday paper , it's so full of stuff , 
but you pick your favorite section , 
and the rest ,
although you paid , what , almost two dollars now to get it 
i like to listen to , uh , national public radio on the way to work because i don't know , it's variety , 
is it pretty good coverage on there ? 
they throw in you know , a lot of interviews and commentaries . 
it's kind of like getting a newspaper . 
there's a lot of 
because i find like on k r l d , 
i like to listen to that , 
but each story is like no more than two or three lines , you know . 
oh , well they spend a little more time , you know , 
they cover the headlines , 
 and then they go into a lot of the issues and 
that would probably be better . 
and it's , 
especially when you look for the , like , popular radio stations like mostly the music stations , news is pretty much nonexistent . 
they have little , teenyweeny news ,
and only in the morning , i guess , there's a little bit . 
i haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long i wouldn't know . 
so let's see , um , 
and i guess i get some kinds of other , you know , business related news through trade journals and things 
 but , um , 
a lot of people are . 
trying to get out of wherever they are 
but , um , i think news is , 
i'm wondering where it's going . 
you know how , 
i think it will be pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper . 
i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news . 
and now , it's kind of your final choice . 
you watch , 
first you go to c n n , then you go to radio or something like that . 
where nobody wants ,
 and i think it , 
it takes a lot more time to read something , 
 and you've got news ,
so much more effort . 
 you know you ,
but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again . 
why is that ? 
i don't , 
well , just because it's getting so short on radio . 
you have two or three , 
i know in dallas you can probably get two all news radio stations out of i don't how many popular radio stations . 
and then on television , you have just the news at six and ten . 
i just , 
and in , 
i find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television , i mean , just given the way society is . 
and i enjoy reading , 
but most 
that's true , too , 
than sit down and take the effort to read 
and they don't have to go get one , you know . 
one thing i like about the paper , um , as opposed to television is that , uh , like when i report , because i'm in television , i have to get the basic , the main facts and that's it . 
that's all you have time for . 
whereas in the paper , i like to read the articles because they get every side , every single side , 
well , that's why i like , uh , national public radio 
they give you headlines that are brief , 
they touch on what's going on . 
and then they'll get into something and really explore it . 
and it's informative . 
it's a lot more informative than , you know , quick , half hour news shows that 
because that's what we do . 
i mean it's like each story is thirty seconds , you know . 
so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time . 
and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think . 
i don't know . 
there's so much going on in the world . 
communication , you know , expands the world now . 
oh , yeah . 
there's too much going on . 
you can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there . 
i think that is one good thing , one great thing , about news , 
and we saw it during the war just now , is that we got all the information within minutes , you know . 
whatever happened , we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it . 
and the question is , or how , some of it , 
i guess , there's a lot of debate about censorship and 
is it the true story 
or is it a 
because even though we do get the story right away , they were censored as to what they 
so all we had to sit here and ask is well , what aren't they telling us , you know . 
so that was pretty scary . 
but we , 
i talked to one woman , 
and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in saudi arabia , she wouldn't want to know , you know , that they're bombing or this and that's going on . 
and at the same time , i talked to another woman , 
and she was so happy to know because she lived through vietnam . 
and she didn't know what was happening at that time . 
and she was so happy to get the information , you know . 
so there's just a lot of different opinions on that . 
to know what's going on . 
sometimes i think there's just a little bit too much . 
you know you get in the habit of , like i say , turn on headline news 
and it will play over and over  , 
and you just tune it out because it's the same thing 
and then , too , a lot of times i think , uh , especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion . 
they tend to ,
you know , like this kennedy thing . 
it's just , i mean , everywhere you turn . 
and you know , it's just like , okay , this is ridiculous . 
 like who cares ? 
but what are you doing ? 
sitting on a computer ? 
 i heard the little clicking . 
oh , okay . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
take care . 
there a lot of places to camp in dallas ? 
but it's a very short drive to areas near here . 
do you do a lot of camping ? 
uh , i can't remember when the last time i actually went camping was . 
it was , uh , several years ago , 
and then i did most of my camping in the mountains . 
well , that must have been fun though . 
i enjoy hiking and camping . 
we went to the   
i have , uh , some land there , 
and so to station yourself there on the land 
well , that sounds fun . 
do you do most of yours in tents ? 
i've only been camping twice . 
oh , wow . 
and one of them i don't really consider camping . 
it was on the edge of the lake 
and it was at a camp . 
i don't like those camping grounds 
i just don't care for that . 
i agree with you . 
i think it's much nicer when you can really get out far enough away where ,
well , it doesn't , uh , 
we , uh , 
four years ago , 
it was about four years ago , my little boy was three months old 
and the first time i left him we went overnight camping . 
and we went , and we found this little peninsula out in the middle of nowhere by the lake . 
and we had a ball . 
just sat out there with our , 
we didn't even use tents then , 
we just had , uh , sleeping bags 
and we fried potatoes and bacon and everything for breakfast the next morning . 
doesn't that always taste so much better ,
i didn't even think about frying potatoes . 
but my sisterinlaw , she's always done a lot of camping . 
and she's good . 
she'd think about bringing a rake so you can rake your area out . 
and , yeah . 
that's right . 
if you don't you'll find every rock on it when you 
well , sh , 
she is always prepared , 
i mean , she brought everything from , like i said , toilet paper to the rake . 
the only thing we'd had to do , we had to go out looking for some kind of a grill , you know . 
and we seen this old refrigerator that somebody had dumped 
 and we broke the , i guess it's the freezing component 
 and we broke that out of there and put it over our , um , hole . 
oh , what a clever idea 
i wouldn't have thought about that . 
well , it held our pan and , you know , the potatoes and stuff . 
we had a good time . 
oh , that's a good idea . 
we're still waiting to go again . 
well if you get a chance , 
now there are some really nice camping areas , uh , up in the wichitas , which is in oklahoma 
arkansas . 
i can't remember the name . 
it's on the oklahomaarkansas border . 
and it won't take but you know , just a quick look at a map to find where those mountains are , 
 but i took a drive up through there , as a matter of fact , last september , just took the drive through to see what was there . 
they have some wonderful camping areas there . 
pretty . 
well , i love to swim , 
so i like to get out by a lake 
well , lake tawakoni is a pretty nice place 
 and we had a two bedroom mobile home there , 
but the boys still liked to throw their sleeping bags out by the lake and 
how old are your boys ? 
oh , oh they're grown now . 
oh , so they don't go camping with you . 
once you start them , they enjoy it all their lives . 
well , i haven't taken my little boy yet . 
i'm afraid to get him out . 
he is so fearless , it terrifies me . 
oh , don't be concerned . 
there's much less for them to get hurt on camping than there is elsewhere . 
think so ? 
well , it's the water he's not scared of . 
he'll go out into it until it's up to his nose 
well , it's easy to keep him occupied though on land . 
i know that i took my kids , we'd go out , 
and i've them walk with me along the lakefront 
 and we'd have a little contest finding the tiniest shell , and finding the biggest shell . 
or we'd hunt pine cones 
and , we did a lot of naturalist work when we were out . 
you know , we , 
and we ate the wild plants 
and we gathered wild berries , 
and , uh , it's really , you know 
the mountains can accommodate you if you know what to find . 
i had my boys build their own little you know , three leg camp stools by cutting a branch off the tree and binding them together with bark . 
well , that sounds so neat . 
and , uh , we cooked in a pot . 
i baked them a cake , right there on a camp fire . 
they were so impressed . 
i used a tire chain and the bottom of a dutch oven . 
well , i'm impressed .
my motherinlaw 
and my , 
well , they've always done a lot of camping . 
i grew up in louisville , kentucky 
and there wasn't , 
i don't know , 
but we just didn't get out . 
my mother and my father split up when we were young , 
and my mother wasn't into that , 
and that's who i stayed with . 
so we didn't do much outdoors stuff , except swimming 
 and we went swimming a lot . 
and , uh , oh , excuse me , my baby's getting sick . 
i know . 
well , if our time is up we can quit . 
um , i've got to clean her up .
i'm sorry , 
appreciate it . 
i enjoyed talking . 
thank you . 
you bet , 
and where they're going than i do beca , 
i'm not a diehard fan 
but i enjoy the , 
i like the boston red sox myself . 
well , i , 
of all the sports that there is , i like baseball the best . 
however , i haven't been to a baseball game in years , 
but i have kept , uh , my eye on the rangers . 
you know 
and i guess they were doing pretty good up to a point , 
and then they kind of fell on their face .
well , with , uh , 
their biggest point of interest has been nolan ryan not the rest of the team lately , 
oh , it's amazing . 
they're so astronomical i can't even imagine 
you know it's just , uh , phenomenal .
well , fortunately the red sox , last time i saw the paper earlier this week , were in first place and doing quite well . 
well , good . 
um , i've been really busy at work this past week 
and normally on my way into work i'll pick up a newspaper 
and , uh , i , 
so every day i'll have a newspaper at work , 
and when i take a break , i'll take a look at the newspaper . 
but this week i've been so busy i didn't even bother to stop .
i understand . 
but hopefully next week i'll get back to my normal routine . 
uh , you are involved with t i s , uh , speech , um , recognition ? 
how did you find out about it ? 
oh , okay . 
from , uh , 
i'm an officer in the air force , 
i see . 
oh , great . 
and , uh , the speech laboratory does some work with , uh , t i ,
i see . 
but , uh , in my division they do ,
well , that's good . 
well , that's interesting . 
but the depth of knowledge is quite different . 
i mean , i can understand baseball , you know , 
i don't understand football . 
 oh , i prefer to , 
i like , 
i never used to really like watching football that much 
but more and more these days i'll like a football game , 
but i've always liked baseball . 
i prefer to watch , um , 
i guess i'm one of the few people that also prefers baseball to football . 
and i'd much rather go to a baseball game than to a football game . 
well , i can relate to baseball because i used to play baseball . 
but i can't relate to football because i've never ,
and i said if i ever had a son , he would not play football . 
and , uh , i had four daughters 
 so that wasn't a question , 
but now i have a grandson that you know , is gung ho for , uh , football . 
well , there's injuries in a lot of sport . 
i understand that , 
but i think they happen more in football . 
i think the odds are cut down . 
you know , i know they can get hurt in baseball too . 
the bat is a very heavy object , can do a lot of damage 
but , uh , i think that they have a lower  racial  of injuries , 
it's true . 
i would say that baseball tends to be one of the less ,
because the , 
but , uh , for some people it's just , uh , uh , 
a love for them . 
well , that , 
not so much that 
but , uh , even in baseball you can , 
like when i played baseball when i was growing up , i had trouble , uh , uh , just throwing the ball because i was always very strong 
and i could , th , 
when i was young i could throw harder ,
i see . 
and so i was always throwing my arm out and , uh , 
and i was a catcher 
so i was constantly throwing back to the pitcher and then down to second base and all and that kind of stuff . 
so i , 
that was always a problem for me was just the constant throwing , 
did you sustain any permanent , uh , injury with that ? 
oh , okay . 
well , i , uh , always been quite an athlete and doing different things 
and , um , the other thing was i'd never really let injuries stop me . 
but interestingly enough you mentioned football , is like , 
now i won't play football anymore because of uh , the separated shoulder wrestling , 
stood the injury wrestling , 
but it , 
as long as i let it heal , it never really bothered me 
then playing football this fall ,
and it seemed to be ,
oh , boy . 
well , uh , i have a broken arm that i had since i was three . 
it was never set right . 
and , uh , uh , i liked bowling as a kind of a relaxing sport . 
and , uh , one of the men that was on our league , uh , noticed , uh , you know , uh , my broken arm and the way my ball would do . 
and so he brought me up from like a hundred and fifteen , i had my high game of two eightyseven . 
my god . 
 so , uh , yeah 
um , it was really funny , you know , that he would tell me where to stand and how to hold my arm and how to , uh , follow through with my , uh , 
 addressing that   , to put the ball , 
the , uh , pins . 
so that was interesting . 
so uh , uh , the bowling league , i guess . 
i'm not sure where all my pins came from , 
but it's , 
but that was quite awhile ago 
and i never pursued it . 
and i thought , no , 
not m , 
i don't , 
my love wasn't there for the game . 
i liked to as a method of , uh , entertainment and i , uh , 
but outside of that , no . 
i didn't . 
still , i like to bowl , 
but , uh , .
are you on any leagues now ? 
and , uh , it's true bowling 
and i've never , uh , shared that with them . 
i would have to brush up on my bowling before i even tried to , uh , win a lot of money for the junior achievement ,
but that's the only thing that i would , you know , be   to do . 
well , my grandmother has been bowling for , gosh , maybe thirty , forty years . 
i don't know , 
a long time . 
and she's got to be , 
still carries a good uh , average ? 
well , no , 
she does , 
so , what's it been doing up there ? 
it's real dry up here . 
oh , really ? 
all the farmers , you know , 
well , it's good for hay . 
you know all the farmers got their first cut of hay and everything , 
 but they're going to need some you know , rain to get the second cut . 
i'm working for a lady who has a strawberry field , 
and if we don't have rain , she's going to lose a lot of money . 
oh , my goodness . 
well , we have been drenched . 
we have had so much rain for may and june that we've got all the , uh , weather people down here really confused . 
oh , my . 
uh , we , 
it's probably , 
it's just , 
by now it's usually , 
and it's still , 
we're still having april showers ,
oh , i hope they come ,
uh , i don't know where it came from 
but it's been really , 
we got a lot of , uh , 
we're in central texas 
and it feels like we live in houston . 
oh , really ? 
it , you know , 
and then it just kind of steamed everything up , you know . 
uh , it's been great because we haven't had to use our sprinkler system , 
we've had some with really , really high winds that have trashed trees and ,
oh , my . 
it's just , 
now see , everyone up here with their gardens they're not going to have much of a garden this year because it's so dry . 
well , i hope you get some of that . 
we got enough . 
we have had plenty , 
and we're still , uh , forecast for more . 
well , gee , 
uh , is california getting rain then ? 
uh , i'm not real sure . 
i think a lot of this is coming out of , 
i think what's happen , of 
it's coming out of canada , 
out of the gulf ? 
and it's meeting what's coming out of the gulf . 
and it's just causing chaos 
so it's been , uh , wet . 
and we've moved our yard i think three or four times in the last two or three weeks . 
oh , my gosh . 
i mean just because it just keeps growing and growing and growing 
one week it just rained , thunderstormed for a day straight 
and you couldn't get out there . 
by the time you finally got out there where your lawn mower wouldn't sink , we were , you know , 
lawn mower broke .
oh , well , see , now we need , 
we could use two days straight of rain . 
it's really drying up here . 
well , what always works for me is if i water my plants or we wash the car , it usually rains . 
if not that night , the next day .
does it ? 
i was telling everyone , hang your clothes out on the line 
and it's surely going to rain . 
whenever you hang your clothes out on the line it always rains .
we've had real hot weather . 
hotter than usual ? 
we , you know , 
and , uh , let me think . 
i got out of school in may . 
in march i was wearing shorts . 
i was wearing shorts in march up at college , 
and , uh , we , w , 
is what they said what happened . 
i hope that , 
oh , i don't know . 
i hope that doesn't mean we're going to get an early winter . 
i wouldn't think so . 
i wouldn't , 
not as early as it came . 
i mean your talking september , maybe . 
that's a little early . 
still the , 
i was wearing shorts in march . 
you know it was nippy 
 but , um , like it was still in the seventies . 
you know , high sixties low seventies in march . 
and we were in new jersey last october 
 and it was hotter there than it was here . 
it was just like a heat wave . 
we haven't , 
and we just died . 
oh , my gosh . 
it was really hot , 
i wouldn't trade it for snow any day . 
see i like the snow 
but i like to watch it fall , 
and i just like it where it's deep enough , you know , but not too deep . 
and i can handle a vacation in it 
you know , but my husband is from new jersey 
and he wouldn't go back either . 
he did all the ,
he said it was a pain . 
well , isn't it weird at christmas time without snow ? 
well , see last year we had snow at christmas time . 
so it was weird because we had snow .
it's like , wow , it actually fell on the right day . 
so , uh , no , 
in fact , uh , you know , we're used to running around in , you know , spring clothes in december , 
and so when it throws in a real cool winter , we get broken pipes just isn't built for 
well , it's real dry down there . 
now in houston and stuff they've got it where no hairsprayer works . 
it's so humid at times , 
but here it's just about right . 
it's pretty dry and , not too dry where , you know 
we're just having all this rain , 
and late rain has made it kind of uncomfortable . 
muggy , huh ? 
but no , 
well , we're right in a good stop because over the hundreds in the summer , 
but it's a dry heat 
and it's not really as hot and muggy as it would be being over a hundred plus ninety degree humidity , 
see that's what's bad up here is when we do get the real , you know , hundred and the high nineties , we have the humidity to go with it , 
so you're like real mucky 
and you , you know , 
your legs stick together just from walking 
i know what , 
so , um , 
so we like it where we're at . 
if it's not a whole bunch of everything at once 
but no , 
and people forget that they're , live in texas 
and they don't know how to drive in snow 
oh , that's good . 
i was born in texas 
and i visited other areas , 
and i'm just a sun person i think . 
i've gotten used to it . 
well , i don't know .
well , i guess that's really about all . 
it doesn't last real long either . 
but , well , michelle , it's great talking to , 
um , the last movie that i have seen , 
it's been a couple of months . 
i saw , um , sleeping with the enemy 
i saw that one . 
those were the last two that i've seen . 
what was the second one ? 
i didn't see that one . 
oh , it was just , 
well , someone had , 
i had seen the advertisement for flatliners on t v , 
and i thought i'd like it , 
and then , uh , one of my friends who went to see sleeping with the enemy , she told me to go . 
it was good . 
so that's why i saw that one . 
well , i've , uh , 
i saw sleeping with the enemy 
and um , i've seen , uh ,  well   , just recently , um , what about bob ? 
i like comedies better than i do dramas . 
i , uh , am not one for the , uh , 
i don't need the suspense movies or the , 
did you care for sleeping with the enemy ? 
 uh , because my wife wanted to see it . 
uh , but on the other hand , i'm not sure i would have gone otherwise , 
and having gone , uh , 
well , it really wasn't on a theme that i was , uh , uh , that into , 
or , as i say , i prefer the light movies that , uh , 
my style of entertainment is comedy , uh , primarily 
 well , i didn't care for the movie myself . 
you kind of have to like to be , uh , drawn to this point where you aren't sure what's going to happen . 
well , okay , 
on likewise then , did you see pretty woman ? 
uh , yes . 
do you enjoy that one ? 
well , i'm trying to think of the other one i saw recently , the one on , um , defending your life . 
oh , i haven't even heard of that one . 
well , that was one where , uh , 
it's kind of like , 
to me it's somewhat like pretty woman . 
the story line , um , 
if you accept a few of the basic starting points , i guess the rest falls in place . 
uh , it was hard to accept that , uh , this , uh , multimillionaire wheeler dealer uh , would , you know , find himself and allow himself to get into that situation . 
well , i really liked pretty woman . 
you know , i just , 
well , you just kind of went with it . 
like you said , you had to accept the beginning of it and just kind of go . 
it's sort of a modern cinderella type of story . 
but , um , flatliners , now , it's a drama , 
and i don't usually like them , 
and i really enjoyed it . 
um , i don't know , 
it was kind of , 
it made you think a lot 
did you see ghost ? 
now , did you care for that one ? 
uh , that was , 
i hate to be too surprised in a movie , 
and in that one you could pretty well guess where it was ,
you weren't sure exactly how it would get there , 
but you knew where it would end up . 
see , now , i didn't , 
i thought it was an okay movie , 
but it wasn't something that i would enjoy seeing twice or three times . 
i didn't think so , um , 
i really didn't care for the ending of it . 
i thought it was just of like you didn't know this was going to happen , 
when , you know , 
but , um , i don't know , you know . 
well , of course , uh , a bunch of girls had told me and warned me , 
meanwhile , i sat through the movie and said well , when are you supposed to start crying , you know .
i didn't really , 
well , whenever she starts crying .
well , do you go to many movies more than once ? 
but like you said , i enjoy the comedies a lot better . 
in fact , that's where i've seen most of my movies , have been on video . 
well , these days it's , uh , 
you see it on video just as soon as it is on the movie screen . 
well , with some of the movies , if you don't go to them within the first four weeks , the movie may have , uh , left town , never to show up again until it comes back in video . 
so , uh , unless a movie is popular and stays around , uh , you probably will see it on video these days more likely than at the movie . 
so we have , um , 
well , i think just most people have v c r s now 
and we probably watch twice as many movies at home 
oh , yeah . 
and i can't think of the name of it now , that , um , 
it was a book before it came out in a movie , 
and it was a drama . 
did you go to dances with wolves ? 
i didn't get to . 
in a longer version 
oh , really ? 
it's sort of the uncut version . 
at least that was some of the rumors . 
we'll have to see , because uh , there was some talk about that . 
maybe it will come out this fall . 
we're sort of in the middle of the summer , um , season of a lot of new movies coming out , 
but then there's these , um , periods like early fall before christmas or early spring when there's sort of a quiet period where if you bring something out again , it , uh , will increase the revenues from the movie . 
well , um , what movies are showing down there now ? 
oh , i'd actually have to get a newspaper out . 
my approach to movies is i kind of hear about them , uh , 
i keep track of them a little , 
but , you know , ask me to name the ten that are out there right now , 
and i'd have to say , uh , uh , i don't know . 
i just look at the newspaper before i decide to go 
that's pretty much what i do . 
i know for sure that that one about , 
what was that one about bob ? 
uh , it's kind of ,
i think it's just , 
i think it's just playing now up here . 
because some of them , uh , they'll start in one area of the country , 
and if they it's , 
i guess first of all i'll just say we haven't done much , uh , gardening . 
we do lawn work all the time . 
but , uh , our gardening we lost , 
remember the last two freezes , 
i don't know how long you've been here .
but we lost our bushes in those and have been waiting to plant new ones . 
and so , as far as our bushes , we don't have any 
but we do have some blackberry bushes . 
 oh , really . 
and we've done really well with them . 
did you plant those yourself ? 
and so they've been really good 
and the kids , i had to , 
the first year i had to tell the kids not to pick them when they were red because they were supposed to be blackberries . 
but , uh , we go out , 
it's hard to go out when it's this hot . 
and keep them off the ground so the ants don't eat them . 
and they're okay . 
that's nice . 
i love blackberries 
and we , uh , 
when i was smaller , my family lived in tennessee 
 and there used to be wild blackberries that we'd go out and pick , my brother and i . 
but , i don't have any down here . 
uh , we have some flowers that have , 
they're just are real hearty also , 
and they're bold 
and they come up every year 
but , uh , they're getting too thick , 
i need to go thin them out . 
i don't know what kind of flowers they are . 
they're real common around here . 
they're orange 
and they look like a lily , sort of . 
 oh , i think i know what they , 
i can't remember what the name of them   are either . 
the rain on the outside , little rain 
and , and they look real pretty after the rain . 
and so i really like them 
but i need to get out and , um , do that . 
now as far as our grass , it grows crazy here . 
it just keeps growing and growing 
and sometimes my son does it . 
but it just is , 
i don't know . 
i've lived in utah my whole life 
and we can't seem to get ours green . 
i don't know . 
well , i'm , 
  we've had problems with our yard . 
it was one big weed is what it was . 
it was just horrible . 
and my neighbors on either side of me have beautiful lawns 
and we have this god awful ugly thing . 
crappy i know , 
we have that too . 
but my husband got some new fertilizer and stuff , that seems to be helping 
and he put it on the front yard 
but we've got a great dane in the back 
 and she has eaten everything i have put out there . 
she's eaten my crepe myrtle trees . 
oh dear . 
i know , 
and she's eaten the bushes . 
i've tried to , i spent like eight hours planting this nice garden out there 
 and i barricaded it up ,
and i went and took a shower and looked back out there 
and she was already in it . 
 and i was so mad . 
had somehow gotten in . 
so i can't do anything back 
but i've tried out in the front 
i had put out front 
and it killed those too . 
so , i'm just real discouraged with the whole thing . 
i just don't even want to do anything . 
the other problem that we have , 
well it's funny because the two bushes on the ends of the house that i think are ugly , they lived 
 and so i don't know . 
that happened to us . 
we have these , 
so like i wanted to go out and kill them too . 
i know . 
they had no right to live . 
but anyway , uh , under our trees we get a north sun 
and , uh , the , 
it looks like our trees don't have any grass under them . 
 oh , i know . 
ours don't . 
 and we just can't grow , uh , grass underneath there . 
i know , 
we can't either . 
but i've got two good size cottonwood trees out in my front yard . uh , you know one on either side of the yard . 
and they're big 
and   they're real full and everything , you know , in the summer time 
but it's killing everything underneath 
but toward the end of the summer , you know , when everything starts dying off and whatnot and then the light can get through the tree , then the grass starts growing . 
but , by then it's so late then the winter comes and it stops . 
you know , 
it just really , 
so we've been trying to get something or to pull some grass underneath there and whatnot . 
well , i don't , 
we've never done anything like this 
but we've been thinking , you know , if we built up , uh , you know , either a wooden like trench thing around where our bushes were and filled it like with a nice dirt 
and so i think that we're going to try that . 
 , i think that's pretty much what we have decided . 
now i have two long windows 
well i don't really have to worry about that that much because my sons' bedrooms are in the front 
and they've got miniblinds and stuff . 
but only one is really like in the flower bed part 
and the other one is out on the porch . 
so there's not really much i can do about that . 
that's what our two rooms are on the front , too , with these long windows . 
one is a bedroom for our oldest son 
and one is , uh , an office that my husband and i work in . 
and so , i really don't like it too much because then the back of our house faces that , 
well , the flowers are out by the back of the house , 
and that's why the front room is . 
so that's not too bad . 
but , i like to look at the flowers . 
they're pretty . 
i do too , 
that's why i look at my neighbors yard .
i don't have anything to look at 
so i look at theirs . 
but it's funny because , uh , you try so hard i think sometimes anyway i do , to do our yard 
 and then it's like the wind blows everything whether the weeds from your yard to your neighbors or yours 
or and so even if you did get it under control , it seems like in just a few months it would all be back 
and  , 
it's really a pain . 
my husband works a lot 
so , um , a lot , 
it's hard to get out a lot and do that yard work . 
it's usually me and the kids that go out and mow the yard 
i hate to mow the yard , more than anything else . 
i hate to mow that yard . 
i know . 
it's not my favorite ,
i'm glad i have an old enough son to do it for me now . 
well mine's getting there . 
he helps , 
he does half 
and i do half , 
well that is one chore that we will pay him for , if he'll go do the yard work out , outside , 
 oh sure i'll be more then glad to pay him 
 that's my only thing with him . 
that's why i'm having him help me now .
well , some of the things i like to do are , 
i like to knit . 
i knit sometimes , 
and i sew 
 and , uh , i like to sew sometimes for my kids . 
i sew clothes for them every once in a while . 
 and i make quilts . 
oh , wow , 
that's the next project that i'd like to learn to do . 
i do mostly hand needlework like cross stitch and crewel embroidery 
and i'm beginning to get a little bored with cross stitch . 
i was thinking maybe need to learn to quilt . 
after a while , cross stitch , i th , 
i don't know . 
i have 
it gets boring . 
and then i have to bring it back . 
you know . and , uh , i don't know why that is . 
i don't know if it's looking at the little things every time . 
well , it reaches a point where it doesn't seem to be very challenging , i think . 
that might be it . 
but i do 
and yet , there's , 
oh , do you ? 
 so i have nearly an hour both ways that i can really get a lot of work done 
oh , i bet . 
i don't know that i could even think about quilting . 
a needle and thread 
but it's very long . 
it's very tedious if you don't have a whole group , you're not finishing a quilt in a long time .
oh , i bet . 
so , uh , 
but , it's such a lost art . 
so , uh , i like to just mostly do the tie quilts . 
that's so much easier . 
but , uh , the other ones are very pretty . 
they're , uh , 
we have a quilt on our bed that's , 
instead of , like , yarn 
and it's real pretty . 
i bet . 
there's so many things i wish i had learned to do with my mother . 
she had crocheted a full bedspread . 
it's kind of a hobnail 
oh , wow . 
and when i look at it now , she's been dead for a long time 
now did you say you could knit ? 
haven't tried that either . 
well , i was going to say because , 
i want to learn to crochet . 
it's just like doing one handed as long as you learn how the yarn in between your fingers on your left hand . 
and then you just use your right hand with the hook . 
and that's not , 
it's really not too difficult . 
you could learn that , i'm sure 
i think if you can do any handicraft , you can learn to crochet . 
it's not too difficult . 
it's funny , when you were talking about sewing , i love to do anything by hand with a needle . 
but i'm totally intimidated if i sit down at a sewing machine . 
i never learned , 
and i get real nervous whereas usually the other needlework stuff is relaxing to me . 
isn't that interesting . 
but i just have a phobia about not being able to actually sew . 
i think that's really interesting . 
and yet , you know , i think about , you know , 
and there are some beautiful , just gorgeous patterns 
and one of the arts that i think are really pretty . 
and a lot of people don't do that either . 
you know , and so , 
well , it's hard to find the time . 
i wouldn't if i didn't have this car time ability probably 
that's true . 
you know , and i always think , well , i can do this and watch t v or something 
and , uh , it seems like i always get my mind carried away to something else 
and then it doesn't 
well , it , 
i'm at the age where bifocals or trifocals would be necessary . 
it's so i find myself putting glasses on to watch t v and then taking them off to do needlework 
and i get frustrated doing that 
so . ust give it up . 
and , you know , i like to sketch . 
i can sketch something , like if i see a picture , like , out of a book , i can sketch that 
 and that's nice and everything , 
but , you know , it's funny , 
 , i can't draw it out of my own head 
i wish i could . 
like , uh , craft , uh , on wood . 
i can't do that painting thing . 
and yet , 
i'm the same way . 
if i see something , i can copy it , 
but i certainly can't create . 
i admire people that have that in their minds already . 
me , too . 
i know a woman who's just wonderful at that . 
and i look at it 
and , you know , you look at those things 
and you wish so badly that you could do them . 
i guess , if you wanted to , you could take classes and learn . 
i guess that's the only way i could do it . 
well , sometimes , even with that . i think you have to have some , 
what kind of fishing do you do ? 
well , mostly , uh , a little fresh water fish , 
but mostly lake fishing like rainbow trout and stuff because i used to live in utah . 
but , uh , down here i haven't fished much in texas . 
that's one of the few things i've ever fished for is rainbow trout . 
oh , they're really not , 
i think they're good to eat . 
what kind of bait do you use to catch them ? 
oh , just , usually worms , night crawlers . 
sometimes fish eggs . 
oh , really ? 
fish eggs ? 
oh , i didn't know that . 
just little fish eggs . 
and , uh , there's this one kind of cheese that you can put on the end of a hook 
and it will stay relatively well .
oh , i didn't know that . 
that's a great way . 
 and they really like that . 
i think that would probably be a good way to catch catfish , 
now i have never caught catfish . 
personally i like to catch large mouth bass 
but a catfish will really just tear into anything like that , like liver 
oh , is that right ? 
now in amarillo did you fish any  of this   ? 
uh , no . 
 and they have the , uh , lake texoma right next to them . 
so the , 
we used to catch some , uh , sand bass off there's a roosevelt bridge 
and what we'd do is let the line all the way to the bottom and crank up , you know 
and the fish would be sitting at different levels . 
oh , how about that . 
so , yeah , 
you just leave it at that level 
and in no time something would hit it 
and you could pull them up two and three times in a row , 
but you had to find out what level , how many cranks they were off the bottom . 
and if you left it on the bottom , there was a good chance that you'd catch catfish . 
and , of course , depending on how big your bait was , uh , you know , would be depending on what you caught . 
oh , i think that is really interesting . 
that was a lot of fun . 
my grandfather used to do that 
and we used to have a light at the top of the water . 
he'd really spoiled me in that respect . 
i think they're , 
see , and i wish i could go fishing here because i don't really know much about the fishing here . 
i guess it would , 
if you did it like you were just , uh , saying , that's pretty much like rainbow trout . 
you bait the hook , 
you throw it in , 
you troll it 
and then you wait 
 and they troll it a little bit . 
well , if you , 
do you have any friends with ponds ? 
i , uh , 
well , if you can fi , 
well , or even a lake . 
if , uh , 
seems like every time somebody's on the bank , all they want to do is throw it out just as far as they can 
but it's the opposite when you're fishing from a boat . 
make it land right on the shore and then drag like a plastic worm 
oh , uhhuh . 
so you don't have to really get , uh , fish from a boat , you know , because they're actually right there at the shore . 
but , i didn't used to be sold on plastic worms , 
but , uh , if , 
i am now .
you are now . 
oh , yeah 
i've never used those . 
that's really interesting . 
it uh , just a slow reel 
and then let it sit on the bottom , 
but the key is to always have your line tight . 
and that way you can feel when they're hitting it , 
and believe me you'll know the difference . 
uh , what kind of fish do you like the best to eat ? 
oh , crappie actually . 
oh , do you  ? 
we're about three hours from the ocean . 
and i also like spanish mackerel . 
and you catch blues 
and , uh , that's a different kind of fishing off the pier , too . 
have you ever fished off the pier ? 
 uh , where you'd catch crappie . 
my neighbor has gone before 
oh , the best thing for crappie is those little spinner baits and jigs . 
uh , they have like yellow , uh , fuzz on a hook , you know , that kind of comes out . 
oh , oh , i know . 
uh , they're sort of like , well , i want to say flies , 
but not exactly like , 
but they're a little heavier 
and they're bigger . 
get the yellow ones . 
the yellow . 
those are the ticket .
 and let them drop to the bottom and maybe do a , a kind of a slow reel . 
you don't even have to have a good rod or anything . just even a regular line 
 and you throw it out 
and , uh , the other thing that's real good is small , uh , 
it's a real small  rapalla  .
it's about an inch and a half long 
and they're all silver , something real shiny about that long . 
they'll go after that in a heartbeat also . just anything that really shines or spins . 
my mom , she just loves to fish 
and she has a lot of those little , uh , 
they almost look neon . 
you know , they're just real colorful 
oh , yeah , 
that's it . 
and she's really a good fisher woman . 
oh , really ? 
that's neat . 
well , you sound like you're a good fisher woman , too . 
hi , clarice . 
um , have you had a family reunion recently ? 
and we met , it was my , 
we usually go to my family reunion , 
but this one was my husband's 
 and they're usually quite similar , i think . 
are you both from utah originally ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
 but , uh , most of his people are from oregon , 
so we kind of met halfway 
 and so , this was one , 
and they , um , planned it up in the mountains and got a cabin 
oh , how nice . 
things like that have to be planned , 
like they had planned 
june and first of july 
but we had to plan everything like clear in december , january 
oh , wow . 
this was everybody . 
oh wow , 
how many people were there ? 
oh , jeez , i think over , um , three hundred 
it was quite a large 
it was a great big lodge , 
and so we had plenty of room and everything , 
and some of them live in that area , 
so it wasn't too hard for them to come in the day and leave . 
but , um , that was a great big thing , 
and we do that with his family about every five years ,
and then like immediate family like we try to do one thing once a year . 
now how many people are in his immediate family ? 
well , he has eight brothers and sisters 
oh , wow . 
 so that's big by itself . 
it really is , 
and you get together once a year . 
so we have a little shindig with them . 
are they all here in the area , 
or are they 
um , let's see , 
there are four of them who live here in texas , and his mom and dad . 
so , um , the others live in close neighboring , um , states , like nevada , arizona 
oh wow , 
that's wonderful . 
 so , it's been fun . 
how about you ? 
well , we don't really get together , 
i would love to , 
and that's why i checked that i wanted to do that , because i would love to plan a family reunion sometime . 
um , i have a sister in colorado , and , uh , a sister in upstate new york , and a sister in connecticut , and here i am in texas . 
so we're kind of scattered right now . 
and , uh , you know , they put on a family reunion , um , once a year , 
but it's always like the second week in september , 
so it's , 
the kids are already back in school 
 and that's back in the 
that's hard . 
 and that's in new york , 
and i mean there's 
and it's not really a weekend , 
it's just like a day kind of thing , because most of them are , you know , um , 
my family moved to connecticut , 
the rest of the family stayed in new york 
and so , they're all kind of local and close , 
and so they just have you know , a day picnic , 
and , uh , i've always thought it would be so neat , even if it were just my immediate family , to have like a weekend type thing 
that would be so wonderful .
it really is fun , 
and my mom's family does it once a year , just like you said 
once a year , um , they have a saturday type thing . 
you can come and go as you please type thing . 
oh , wow . 
and they do that once a year . 
i kind of missed it this year , and felt bad , 
but you can't go every year , 
you just 
and do they have a hotel , 
or where do you stay ? 
um , basically , they just stay with each other , brothers or sisters . 
there are enough in the area to just kind of span yourself out . 
take everybody , 
whoever's mom and dad it is , you usually go and stay with them , 
like i go stay with my mother , 
and my cousins , they just go stay with their mom and dad , you know 
and so it's not hard in that respect because they all are pretty centralized in one utah area 
 so that's not hard , 
oh , that sounds so wonderful , 
isn't that nice . 
 and they send out , 
my mom's family now , 
this is the first reunion with my husband's family i've really been involved with , 
but my mom's family , each brother and sister takes a turn one year , 
and that's how they divide it up 
but then one brother and sister from each family . 
 and each one of them take their turn . 
oh , wow , 
and then 
like if it was my mother's turn 
oh , i see , uhhuh . 
oh , wow , 
and , um , the thing is , that , um , the real part is there are two mailings that go out , 
and the first one is to just kind of give an approximate date and time so you can start making , 
what do you think of the public school system ? 
first off , do you have children that are in it ? 
and i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a fulltime job in the public school ,
 oh , okay .
well then , you should be a good one to know because my children are grown now . 
i now have grandchildren ,
so , uh , i don't have firsthand experience right now ,
so what do you think ? 
well , i think the public school systems are doing a good job . 
i think they have a long way to go yet 
but i think that , um , they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier . 
you know , my kindergartners were on the computers , 
and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done . 
and i think that , uh , the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them , you know , skills . 
you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together . 
and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think , 
they literally cannot come in out of the rain . 
you know , and that just , 
i don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted . 
 and , uh , this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education . 
so i think , you know , they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have , 
and i think that's very , very important . 
it is . 
i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren , 
we have a , uh , fourth grader 
and then we have one that's in kindergarten 
were doing in the fifth and sixth grade . 
oh , yeah . 
 oh , yeah . 
i tutor a girl that's in eighth grade 
and her prealgebra book is higher then some of my algebra two ,
is that scary ? 
 and it's like , oh , i going to take this home and study it before i can help you . 
 you know , so they're really moving them along 
but yet , at the same time , you know , they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life . 
 and that's wha , you know , 
a lot of the things that we did in school i've never used and never will use . 
it's appropriate to teach them , you know , why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this . 
are you finding that , uh , since you're doing substitute , that you're wanting to do fulltime ? 
um , i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms . 
that's a , 
 and d , 
do you find that ? 
 well , filling out the forms and also all of these , uh , statewide and national wide testing ,
and   . ou know , as far as i'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say . 
and it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it . 
and you waste so much time quote , unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be ,
you know , is used as a review 
but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in ,
coming up , 
and i think that's totally useless . 
i think , you know , there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons 
but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous . 
it's like bragging on your grandchildren . 
you know , and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth 
and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this , 
and that's great . 
but that's what they're doing with the school systems 
and they're wasting too much time on that , i think . 
 well , this friend ,
 and she teaches , uh , uh , uh , emotionally disturbed children . 
 and she says she has , um , six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade . 
but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something . 
i didn't quite understand it . 
there's a , 
 and , uh , 
the bottom line is always money , 
how do i make use of credit cards ? 
um , let's see . 
i carry a lot of credit cards with me mostly because i don't ever have cash . 
and i , 
do you work for texas instruments ? 
well , at t i we have to use what's called a  tex teller  
and those are only available at t i . 
oh , okay . 
so if i'm in a mall or something i can't get cash out without paying extra money 
so i'm always using credit cards . 
well , myself i always , tr , 
i'm a traveling person 
 and i'm out of town quite a bit 
so i use credit cards quite a lot also as far as everything from service work and gasoline in my car to my lounging , entertainment and for everything . 
me too . 
so that's , uh , 
as far as using them outside that i don't use them too much 
but   i think my wife is sort of like you 
she uses a credit card ,
so she does most of the shopping for our household 
so she'll use them more than i will . 
but do you get to pay the bills ? 
so it's me i'm the guy that always goes to like dillard's 
and i'll go in and charge something 
and i'll have to give them my driver's license . 
they'll have to look up the number because i'm never carrying a credit card . 
but i do carry like my american express and my visa which i use for , you know , primarily work type things . 
this is my first call by the way , 
oh , it's mine too . 
oh , is it really ? 
all right 
so we're both beginners then . 
i've had this for a couple weeks 
and i've been out of town 
so this is my first time to , 
 oh , okay . 
i see . 
um , let's see . 
i'm not sure . 
but i really don't have too much more to say in regards to credit cards . 
one thing i've always tried to do is when i get my credit cards , i always try to pay them off because i just sort of detest paying interest . 
oh , yes . 
 and , uh , 
like years ago my wife and i got married 
she was the one with a little bit   than i was because i had my credit cards , i think , up to the limit 
and i was giving everyone ten dollars a month and everything like that . 
that will cost you a fortune . 
that was like thirty years ago 
so now it's a little different . 
i get a bill 
and i'll pay it the same day it comes 
and i just kind of tell my kids how much i hate paying interest 
so they should follow the same rule . 
that's right . 
well , yeah , 
oh , you bet it's ju , 
it's an absolute savings . 
or if you travel for work and you get your reimbursement before the bill comes in ,
you bet . 
that's very handy . 
it works great . 
well , i think that's all i have . 
well , it was nice to meet you . 
and , uh , give it a try . 
i think you'll enjoy it . 
in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot , i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem . 
do you ? 
well , if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students so they could become doctors , the problem would go away . 
you think the problem is not enough doctors ? 
and you think there are plenty of doctors ? 
oh , yeah , 
and i do know that o b , which is my field 
it's astronomical . 
now they can't doing anything about that . 
i don't think they're in a conspiracy . 
i think it's our fault , because we as people just sue them . 
people don't sue 
people are very sue conscious . 
lawyers sue . 
if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor 
well , that's probably true , too . 
but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days . 
well , sure . 
and , so , 
but , you know , when you think about reasonableness , now , i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory . 
you know what tort theory is ? 
well , a tort is when you do something wrong . 
well , it , uh , 
an o b g y n doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent . 
that's right . 
if the baby is born dead , well , that happens . 
if they have complications and , 
well , i know , i mean , there are guys that are real slobs , 
but you know , there are also people out there that are really doing their job . 
well , that's true , 
they are 
many of them are unnecessary , 
they are doing so many c sections 
just to prevent a 
because they have all these monitors now 
and if anything looks even a little bit funny 
see , i believe 
so , it's terrible . 
you know , they have indigent health care . 
you show up at parkland bleeding 
you'll get it . 
that's true . 
in fact , you'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there , too . 
and we have that happen . 
we have patients that go through parkland 
and at the last minute , they come to us . 
i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation 
i'm for that . 
i've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer , 
well , i happen to know a few 
and i even claim one as a friend . 
he's a divorce attorney . 
he better not be mine .
i think he'll go nameless for the purposes of this conversation . 
but i also know an , uh , o b g y n who has stopped practicing . 
some they do . 
uh , he just said , 
they stop their o b at least . 
i mean , he's not going to deliver any more babies 
his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year . 
that's incredible . 
and most of them are very sincere . 
most of them do the 
they are human . 
well , you can be human and catholic . 
but , you're not likely to find somebody who is going to , you know , have a less conscientious effort . 
i mean , 
most of them do . 
i really believe that . 
from dealing with doctors , dealing with lawyers , there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious . 
well , you know , who is getting rich ? 
insurance companies . 
they are . 
you know , if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance , 
say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed 
well , um , i have a former exercise program . 
i'm a graduate student , 
and this semester , i'll tell you what , it's been almost impossible for me to get , you know , back to regular exercise . 
um , last summer i was and life guard , 
so it was really easy for me to get quite a bit of exercise swimming 
um , and since i worked at a recreation center i could , uh , you know , use those facilities quite often . 
but , um . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah . 
and there's 
exactly , yeah , 
um , flu , 
fluid resistance . 
how about you ? 
well , i do , uh , little aerobics , oh , three or four times a week , 
but it's not enough to , 
boy if i go , in the summer time i try to jog a couple of miles 
oh , yeah . 
 and , uh , well , you know , even doing that three or four times a week , when summer hits , that's a hard thing to go out and 
do you kind of think it's a chore , 
or do you enjoy it ? 
part of my problem is i have small children , 
so , uh , to do a whole lot just requires a lot of , oh , coordination as far as 
of course , you got a little different direction going , 
but , uh . 
uh , uh , i used to weigh , uh , two hundred fifteen pounds , 
and now i weigh only about one seventyfive . um , 
 so i drastically had to change the way i ate when i first moved to college , 
and , uh , i had started weight lifting quite regularly , 
and so i got my weight down , 
and it's kind of easy for me to forget about it now , because , uh , you know , when i'm not fat like i used to be 
you don't notice it 
 , yeah . 
although lately i have noticed , you know , even if i gain , like two pounds , i start feeling it 
it's amazing uh , how much , uh , it changes , 
and i weigh probably about the same i weighed for , oh , i don't know how many years , 
but , uh , it's changed places .
and things don't fit just quite exactly 
uh , so , do you do , uh , 
in texas , uh , does 
there , probably quite a few facilities . 
um , i'm living in a dorm right now , 
and so right downstairs there's a facility . 
and i really feel kind of guilty for not working out more than i do because there's a facility right downstairs where is , uh , run down there 
do you enjoy it , 
or is it , uh . 
if you can find the time 
i really do , because i like to you know , get off alone and just do that for a while , 
but that's hard , you know . 
it is hard 
it's , uh , like anything else whether or not you want to 
my problem is i don't want to wake up another half hour earlier 
don't get enough sleep as it is , 
 and , uh , kind of have , 
if you're having the pressures of school and , uh , everything else , it's kind of , 
course it's really , you know , 
as soon as you do it , it's really a release . 
oh , yeah . 
you feel invigorated 
ready to go another twelve hours . 
if i eat very much sugar , boy , just does something . 
do you have to watch what you eat pretty regularly ? 
i have to be real careful . 
i stopped eating meat about , oh , uh , must have been eight months ago . 
did you ? 
i mean , any kind of meat 
and i really feel a lot better now . 
makes a lot of difference . 
well , there's a lot of fat in meat . 
i mean , that's about where almost all of the fat comes from 
 and so . i found that really helps . 
and unless you really like , uh , fish . 
fish is pretty good for you , 
but , uh . 
i eat that , 
i think i've eaten fish like twice since . 
i used to eat a lot of fish , too , 
but i just tried to cut it all out for a while and see what happens . 
kind of see what happens . 
and i like it . 
i've tried to do that with sugar 
 i don't know if i'm that brave yet .
 everything has sugar in it .
i mean , if you go , 
your ketchup has sugar in it . 
and i like sugar , too , 
anyway , well , it's , uh , nice talking to you . 
think we've , uh , covered all the subject . 
it sounds good . 
well , good luck to you there in idaho . 
well , you , too . 
enjoy college while you can . 
let me tell you it's , uh . 
well , i'm in graduate school now . 
i kind of feel like i wish i could have gone back to undergraduate now .
it's a little different , uh 
it is . 
well , it's good talking , 
where are you 
i'm studying speech pathology . 
do you see as , uh , the changes that have occurred in the last    , 
i think one of the thing that i notice a lot , 
i know it's touching social changes , 
but , uh , to me what becomes socially acceptable , 
and i don't know if it's a factor of me growing older and seeing things through different eyes or if it's a factor of our society actually moving in that direction , 
but i notice things on t v being um , open , more i believe , uh , 
they portray things on t v obviously that they never would have years ago , 
you know , and specifically , nudity , things like that , uh , 
i don't know , 
i've said several times to my husband that i feel like gee , in ten years they'll have just full nudity on t v 
and nobody will think anything of it , 
and to me that's surprising . 
to me , that's a big change to accept it , 
and it comes across , i think subtly , you know , a little at a time , to where you get so used to seeing a little change , that , you know , when they go one step further , you don't notice it that much . 
that's one of the biggest ones i've seen . 
that's a big one . 
what about you ? 
well , i think that society has come to a point where they're not responsible for any of their actions . 
somebody else , uh , made them do it . 
uh , that's what i seem to see a lot of , that , uh , no one is willing to take responsibility for their life and their choices . 
i tend to agree with you , 
and i think there's a lot of that . 
um , yeah , 
we have become lawsuit happy . 
any little thing , it's like let's see what i can get . 
you know , kind of like , disregard to others , 
do what makes you happy , 
and yes , 
we should take care of ourselves , you know , 
and we should see to our own lives , but not to a total disregard of others . 
um , i don't know , 
i think it's come to that a lot . 
i see it a lot in my daughter . 
i have a four year old . 
and hers isn't a social thing as much as it's a stage they go through , 
you made me do this , 
and so i try to tell her ,    , everything isn't always somebody else's fault . 
you know , you have to watch where you're going  , 
and , another thing i think has changed quite a bit is , uh , the roles that men and women play . 
that's really in the last thirty years has changed significantly . 
well , both , you know , 
there's some great things that , uh , have come about with more equality , 
but i think that also , 
i don't know what's causing society to have so many broken families and things like that , because i think that's bad for us . 
i do too . 
i think part of that , 
i don't know , 
i can be somebody , you know , 
if i put my mind to it , i can accomplish things too . 
and i think that's good , 
but , um , you know , maybe i think when that was first trying come about with , you know , what we know as the women's lib movement 
i think it was too extreme . 
um , i think you can be feminine and still be all those other things too , you know , 
and i think there's definite roles , 
and i think , you know , part of the break up of the family , maybe it's because of the social changes , 
i don't know , 
the fact that , uh , during their early changes where , you know , women did maybe speak out , i was going to say , come more out of themselves , 
but speak out , 
i think a lot of men were threatened by that . 
i think now less men are , you know , because they're used to it , 
it's around them . 
um , but i don't know , 
i don't know why the families are breaking up . 
i think that may go back to what you said a minute ago about people not being responsible for themselves or their actions , because it's like they don't go into the marriage with a commitment that this is going to work . 
and then i'll get out . 
and i think that directly affects the effort that you put into that marriage or that commitment . 
i would agree with you . 
what kind of movies have you been seeing lately ? 
uh , it's been probably a month or so since i've been to the movies . 
course , is dances with wolves . 
oh , it's an excellent movie . 
uh , silence of the lambs was good . 
silence of the lambs ? 
what was that anyway ? 
oh , i guess it's a mystery , you'd call it . 
it's with , uh , jodie foster . 
and uh , it's pretty good . 
another one that i think i really liked was , uh , the fisher king . 
let's see , 
who was in fisher king ? 
that was , um , robin williams 
how about you ? 
what are you ? 
uh , we've not been having many opportunities to see movies lately . 
um , we really enjoyed , um , dead poets' society . 
um , several years back one we saw we really , really enjoyed was , uh , ordinary people , with , uh , timothy hutton and , uh , mary tyler moore , 
and , uh , uh , who played the father , anyway 
excellent movie . 
have you seen dances with wolves ? 
what'd you think of it ? 
oh , we loved it . 
i don't think i can see it enough times . 
i know what you mean . 
course i'm a kevin costner fan . 
i'm pretty impressed with stuff he's done . 
uh , he made kind of an odd sounding robin hood , 
but , uh , i mean , you know , basic thick western u s accent for a robin hood just doesn't seem to fit . 
but you know , it wasn't a bad movie . 
oh , no . 
it's a good movie . 
it got such bad reviews , 
really , and i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
but then i wasn't expecting any classic either . 
well , um , they did a real good job with it . 
i thought so . 
um , they didn't try to make him super human or , you know , invincible . 
they just , 
he worked hard at it . 
have you seen the fisher king ? 
uh , it , 
you , you know , 
i guess it really isn't for everybody . 
it's , it's pretty deep and , uh , uh , philosophical . 
but i thought it had a wonderful message to it . it's the kind you came out and looked at somebody and said , you know , i think i liked that .
and then the more you got to thinking about it , the more you thought , you know , i did like it .
but when you first came out , you weren't real sure . 
it sounds kind of like one , uh , we saw at home here rented it , um , clara's heart . 
haven't seen that . 
um , whoopi goldberg . 
oh , yes , 
and she played a , uh , 
the , uh , 
she's a housekeeper . 
uh , the nanny type . 
housekeeper , uhhuh . 
anyway , uh , she seemed to be that sort of person that seems half crazy , 
but then again , she's got a whole lot on the ball , 
and the movie had the whole , lot of philosophical content , you know , 
it wasn't a mystery , 
it wasn't , you know , blood and guts and violence and car chases type thing . 
it was just a good movie . 
i saw one the other day that was a kiss before dying . 
a kiss before dying . 
i had not heard about it when it was on the movies , but was out on video . 
and it's with sean young . 
and it's a mystery . 
it was very predictable , 
i mean , you knew when the murder was going to happen or something , 
but it was still so well done 
that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable that's still worth watching . 
that's right . 
i had , uh , uh , 
i like the , i think it's called the , uh , razor's edge , 
but , no 
 oh , okay .
 well , what do you think ? 
and , um , i was a teacher for seven years in the public schools , 
so i know a little bit about it not ,
well , tell me about it . 
well , um , there's some . 
there's several .
but , um , one that , um ,    , i thought it was a serious problem , that i'm not sure it's being taken care of right now , uh , was like bilingual education 
and , um , as the school district , i'm not sure how to go about it , because it's hard to get one teacher that speaks all these languages 
 and so most of these children are put in , um , either special ed or a bilingual program , and then for just a small amount of time , 
and then they're into their regular classrooms the remaining part of the day , 
and so the teachers are not sure how to teach them math when they don't read or speak english . 
and so , um , a lot of the money isn't put into that , 
and so these children are just kind of sat in the corner 
and , um , you know , there's only so long you can do that 
and a lot of the teachers , 
it was not the teacher's fault . 
a lot of the teachers were just not getting the backbone or support that they needed or the materials or the extra help that they needed for these specific children   .
do you find that those parents , um , 
i've seen the same thing and heard the same things , 
and at the same time i've heard that it's even harder when both parents are required to work and can't spend , you know , that time , you know 
typically the mother was at home with , uh , the children 
and really society sort of dictates that , uh , you know , both the parents work . 
and , um , i know i've heard some people talk about just the fact that even as far back as the , you know , the second and third grade , uh , if the kids had , you know , proper reading skills or learned proper reading skills that would make a lot of difference . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , definitely , 
 well , i work at a university , 
and it's really tough when we're , uh , uh , 
i , uh , work at the university of texas at dallas 
and , you know , there are some students who are of their class , 
and their s a t scores are very low , 
and a lot of it has to do with uh , their reading ability , you know , 
 oh , definitely , 
it , uh , makes it tough because   you know when they come in with scores that low , they may be , uh , good students , 
but they just haven't achieved to their fullest potential 
and they're going , 
well , i know richardson school district has a wonderful program in the remedial reading , um , where , you know , 
and , uh , some children who need extra help are put into this , um , reading program , 
and it is just excellent . 
it is , 
i wish that all the children could be exposed to that program , you know . 
and yet they don't qualify , 
but it's unfortunate that they don't qualify , because i think everybody would benefit from these programs . 
it sounds like it . 
it is excellent 
so how many children do you have at home ? 
i have two little ones 
uh , you know , i've been teaching since they were , gosh , newborns 
 and it just wasn't adding up 
and , you know , being a teacher , time . 
it was kind of getting to me , where i'm doing the same thing .
and so , um , you know , my children are getting older 
and i was missing out on a lot , 
so i just decided to stay home for a while , 
i don't know how long .
well , that's good . 
uh , i basically read books . 
it is , 
i do . 
sometimes , when everybody's gone to bed , my kids are in bed and my husband in bed , 
so i will just stay up and finish a book that i am , 
i have about three books that i am going on . 
and i will work on one for a little bit , you know , and then the next one . 
but that's just kind of , 
well , that is pretty impressive to have three books going . 
not always , 
just sometimes . 
oh , yeah . 
and what what kind of books do you read ? 
uh , just really different ones . 
uh , i have one that i was reading on , uh , raising your children and then another one on an autobiography , and another one on , uh , uh , uh , like a crime story .
oh yeah 
a true crime story . 
oh , do you like those detective stories ? 
but this , 
it was just a little different though . 
reading that one last night . 
oh , well that is interesting . 
actually , i like to read also , 
but , uh , usually fall into one or two categories , either true science fiction or fantasy on the one hand or highly technical . 
like my husband . 
kind of one or the other . 
you must , uh , work for t i ? 
my husband does too . 
and i am a computer scientist . 
but , i have a lot of other hobbies . 
well , yeah , 
i am kind of , uh , i guess what you would call a project person . 
oh , really . 
and i love , 
like i have a shop 
and when things break around the house , i always try to fix them myself 
and so , hobby , 
it's funny , uh , 
from the one stand point , it is work . 
but it is a hobby too , that i enjoy 
to find broken , 
 what kinds of things do you fix ? 
well , essentially anything you find in a house . uh , a stove , or oven or a broken piece of porcelain or , uh , chipped tile on the floor . i mean just anything . 
and you have a shop ? 
it is just a work bench and a gazillion tools . 
but , enough that , again for anything in the house i could probably , 
 you can fix just about everything and anything . 
well , that is great . 
and in the car , 
i guess the car too . 
and so , uh , i think i probably would consider that a hobby . 
although , sometimes it gets to be excessive . 
that is pretty much like my husband . 
he is pretty , uh , mobile in that area too . 
he works on the cars . 
he rarely takes them in 
 and , uh , he works on irons , and all t v s and stuff too . 
we rarely have to take those things in too . 
i think it , 
not only can it be fun , 
but it can certainly help your finances . 
oh , yeah . 
i mean during christmas i work on , you know , like , uh , holiday sweat shirts and those kinds of things . 
oh yeah , 
well that's good . 
but , uh , not really .
well , i don't necessarily either . 
i can plink out a song or two on a piano 
 and i can , uh , 
i don't necessarily draw or do any of that kind of art , 
i guess 
i can't do any of that , 
but sweat shirts is certainly impressive . 
uh , i belong to this organization if you have preschool children 
 and , uh , every once and a while they will have a craft , uh , section for the moms 
oh , yeah . 
 and those are really neat 
 and we learn to do the , uh , transfer pictures on the sweatshirts 
oh , yeah . 
 and , uh , those are really neat . 
so we learn different crafts like that 
i see . 
well , that is neat .
i guess you could consider that a hobby . 
do you cook for a hobby 
or do you , 
that's not something you , 
i don't consider it a hobby .
i understand that . 
but , uh , you know , i 
i am not a real elaborate cook or anything like that unfortunately . 
i like to bake off and on . 
and usually once a week i will bake something , 
but it's not anything elaborate , you know .
at least , i don't think it is . 
but , i think that still borders on hobby . 
probably the other thing i do which i am sure will sound horrible to you , is i program for fun . uh , on the computer . 
so , i have little computer projects going on that i consider hobbies . 
but , drive my wife crazy . 
well good . 
you have a computer at home ? 
oh , good . 
in fact , there is actually several of them here right now . 
oh , really . 
not all of them being mine . 
then you are busy .
that is very good . 
uh , i wonder if you can construe raising children as being a hobby ? 
 well , you know one of the books that i was reading , 
and i stopped because it was so , 
the book is so detailed 
 and you have to , 
sometimes i have to go back and read the page over again cause i didn't quite get it all . 
and , uh , it is so detailed , 
what do you think about gun control ? 
well , uh , sort of mixed feelings about it , i guess , uh , uh , 
free army . 
uh , on the other hand of uh , 
of government control in general 
and so it's kind of a tough issue . 
what about yourself ? 
well , i guess that i would like the weapon i suppose 
i'm sure , 
uh , so you would take a position where somebody without a , uh , uh , specific use , 
in other words , if they just wanted to have you wouldn't like them to be able to do that ? 
is that , 
well , i'm not so sure about that , 
but i think somehow , uh , safety courses 
or , i don't know whether this could be something that was done in school , 
but somehow people , 
i'd like to know that the people who had them at least knew what the responsibilities were , whether they followed them or not . 
but still , 
are buying them through legitimate channels anyway . 
uh , that may be wrong . 
uh , you know , i mean , certainly and shoot a brother or sister or , you know , things like that that need to be definitely avoided 
and that's certainly within the channels , 
but , uh , a lot of are purchased through regular channels or they're illegal guns . 
i don't know , 
this morning in our paper , there was an article about somebody who had bought three guns in virginia because all you have to do is get a driver's license , 
so he went over there and got a driver's license , the same day bought three guns and went up to new york and sold them for , you know , very high markups . 
now , in a sense , that's a legal 
but certainly the 
i mean , i think , uh , some sta , 
or , i don't know if it's been actually been implemented , 
i think so , uh , 
or at least there's been talk about doing , uh , you know , like waiting periods 
uh , i think stuff like that is perfectly good . 
i don't know , 
i've , you know , 
and don't really want one , 
and i'd just as soon a lot fewer people did . 
uh , but on the other hand , you know , uh , like i say , i kind of against government control in general . 
and i suppose total ban would lead to more illegal weapons . 
and i , you know , 
something about banning is that , you know , that they're not going to disappear anytime soon . 
uh , and they're already , 
i know there's a ready market for them , you know , 
in the s , 
the stolen guns can be sold . 
i mean , the first thing a burglar will pick up if he can is a gun . 
uh , because they , they can be so easily sold 
and , you know , they're , 
i don't know how many millions of guns have been sold in this country , 
but , uh , it's not like they're going to disappear all of a sudden . uh , even if you do do a total ban on them . 
uh , it's a real tough problem . 
i don't know , 
i don't know where i really come down on it . 
i mean , i grew up , 
my father was a hunter , 
and that's sort of almost a separate issue . 
i think we've generally been talking about handguns and that kind of thing , 
but that's true . 
i mean , some people grew up with guns in the house . 
we never had any in the house 
 so , to me , you know , the first time i saw a gun up close was a pretty scary thing . 
and i'm not sure that's good either . 
well you know , we , i grew up with them . 
i never really took to hunting . 
i mean , i did some of it , 
but , uh , you know , we never had any handguns or anything like that . 
we for quail and pheasant hunting and things like that . 
and , you know , it was a whole different thing 
and gun safety was taken very seriously 
and it was , you know , 
i mean , before we go hunting , we took safety courses , uh , you know , 
and it , 
but , you know , that seems to me to be just a whole another issue . 
 uh , you know , the thing , 
i'm not certain that people are terribly concerned about other people . 
do you , uh , have a family budget , 
or , how do you work your budgeting ? 
well , for many , many years , uh , my wife and i did have a budget . 
uh , we were both working at the time and so forth 
and , uh , that , 
we had to do that until we finally got the house paid for and other big bills taken care of . 
uh , we have a budget , 
but not as strict now as we used to because we don't have quite such a tight financial situation . 
so uh , it's helpful . 
i mean , yes , 
and that did get us so that , you know , the house is paid for and , uh , other major things are taken care of 
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before , 
so we don't have to have quite as strict , uh , a budget as we did . 
oh , well , we don't have a real strict budget . 
uh , we have a low budget to work on , 
but we , uh , you know , 
for like groceries , we say about this much per week 
and then 
i don't know of a written figure of expenses that we , you know , keep to or anything , 
but i know that i go to the grocery store that we always stick within , you know , five dollars between here and there . 
a certain amount . 
i think i do that automatically myself . 
i mean , i unconsciously , uh , you know , stay i have enough food already stored here 
all i normally do now is pick up little things here and there . if the salt goes out or we need sugar or something like that . 
that's great . 
we have two freezers , 
and , course , we have a large garden here that we grow a lot of our own stuff 
and we freeze a lot of that , 
so a lot of the vegetables are taken care of in our own 
oh , you guys sound pretty self sufficient .
 well , on a wall . 
if anything is absolutely out , make a note of it 
and then , uh , the next time i go to the store , why , i pick it up and fill it up . 
so it's worked very well that way . 
that way  , you know , if each of us finds something is missing , uh , we put it up . 
uh , the other person might not know about it . 
that way we 
well , that's a good idea . 
let's see , 
all i can think of is if you don't keep a real tight budget , how do you control expenses , 
but , uh , one , 
another thing that we do is we always fly back to california and washington each christmas . 
well , not fly back , 
but somehow we get back there . 
and , uh , this year we did it by train because it was the least expensive 
well , actually , it's more interesting , too , if you've 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , you know , we could go to both places without having to spend so much for 
well , i think we unconsciously do the same thing . 
excuse me , my throat's not as clear today as it should be . 
that's all right . 
uh , we are , uh , going to be traveling to europe with a choral . 
we sing with a so called pennsylvania choral 
 and we make a two weeks tour of , uh , foreign countries 
and , of course , that costs money . 
so we , uh , 
each of us watches the funds that we spend and make sure to make this trip . 
so that is another way of , uh , budgeting 
that's right . 
 and i think we just sort of unconsciously do it . 
we , uh , just live a normal life , 
but we don't throw any money away , particularly . 
we save it for this trip , which is , uh , always very , very nice . 
well , whenever  , 
but whenever i find , you know , a dime or something on the ground , i , i'll probably pick it up .
i do the same thing . 
i have a whole pile of them saved that i have found by parking meters .
i have a special little jar that i keep all the money i found in . 
you know , just 
but , yeah . 
well , let's face it , 
to have a budget  , 
and , uh , i keep track of mine on a more rough basis now by just watching the level of my checking account 
and i have a money market account also . 
and , uh , i keep those levels up above a certain minimum , 
and i'm always trying to , 
well , are you in the market for a new car ? 
uh , well , yeah , 
well , actually i'm looking for another car , 
but , uh , uh , new , 
probably not . 
what sort of requirements to you have for your car ? 
uh , sports car . 
uh , usually either black or red . 
and electric windows , and power locks .
i see .
top of the line . 
i've had so many times when , uh , uh , you know , i'll have a friend next to me or i see uh , guy broken down on the side of the road and try to lean over and roll down the window . 
it is just a real pain , 
or , you know , if i'm driving along and there's somebody next to me and , uh , somebody that i know and you try to talk to them 
just things that , uh , just really help a lot .
what about you ? 
well , i guess i'm , uh , more traditional in that i don't like power windows or power locks ,
i just don't like anything that i can't figure out why it doesn't work .
and then i want , you know , good , uh , gas mileage 
and i want an air bag 
and , uh , i guess , 
have you ever had a car with an air bag ? 
have you ? 
somehow i just think , you know , i like the idea .
well , sure seems to save lives 
 uh , yeah . 
actually , i like the antilock brakes . 
that's a good idea . 
and i have never had a chance to , 
i have been in cars that have had them , 
but i've never tromped on the brakes uh , you know , on ice or water just to see if they didn't lock up . 
well , actually i don't know a lot about different brands . 
i tend to have , you know , my requirements like the last time i bought a car i guess i did sort of prefer american 
and my requirements were basically , you know , good repair record , good mileage , uh , 
 and i needed airconditioning 
and , uh , can't remember what my , oh , 
i wanted uh , stick shift . and , so i didn't have a whole lot of choice .
there was one car in all of the metropolitan area that i could find that , you know , was sort of a medium priced car with a stick shift in it . 
what was that ? 
a chrysler . uh  , lancer . 
stick shift , 
and basically , it was something that a military guy had ordered and hadn't picked up , 
and so it had been on the lot three months 
and they were really eager to sell it . 
so , i guess in this area , at least , you know , if it's not automatic , it doesn't move . 
well , actually , i much prefer a stick shift 
and , what , i'm curious . 
i know why i love a stick shift . 
why did you want one ? 
well , i just wanted it because , again , i had , i guess traditionally always had a car that had one 
and i thought it would be more reliable . 
it's hard to find stick shift cars anymore . 
i found that out . 
 i mean , you know , the people would just sort of look at me like , you must be crazy when i ,
well , i'm not even sure all of them are anymore . at least in this area . 
not that i was looking for sports cars , 
but , now the people i've talked to don't seem to have stick shift . 
and so why do you like stick shift ? 
uh , i guess i grew up on it and it's fun . 
it's an enjoyable part of driving . 
i do feel like i have , uh , more control 
and to me , it gives me more , a lot more control in snow and ice 
uh , it does , uh , 
i don't know , 
it's really more fun than anything 
 as long as you're not stuck in heavy traffic , it's fun .
and actually it's probably safer on , you know , long trips because it keeps you more active . 
uh , of course , i like gadgets and , uh , fun things ,
are we tonight ? 
okay , leslie , 
i'd like to find out a little bit about your hobbies . 
what do you like to do in your spare time ? 
well , and when i have my spare time  ,
actually , it's a cherished commodity now days , huh . 
that's right . 
uh , i do enjoy , uh , sewing , 
i hand , uh , 
i do some needlepoint . 
oh , great . 
and i've been doing a a picture for my fatherinlaw , 
but if i , uh , ever get enough spare time ,
and some other things i like to do are , music and , uh , also reading . 
what kind of music ? 
well i enjoy singing . 
oh , okay . 
well great . 
i enjoy music too 
and i , uh , 
one thing that i like to do , uh , is sit down and play the piano . 
i can't play that well , 
i enjoy that . 
uh , a couple of hobbies that i also have is , uh , 
i really enjoy bike riding 
and the biggest hobbies i have right now are my kids and whatever they are involved in . 
like my , uh , oldest boy is involved in soccer 
so we go out and play kick the soccer ball around or play throw the football 
and , uh , we also like to , uh , ride bicycles . 
so we're riding bicycles 
and so a lot of the hobbies that i have right now are centered around my children and also things that my wife and i like to do 
uh , so personally a lot of the hobbies i had when i was growing up and , uh , going to college and so forth are having to change . 
i really enjoyed , uh , mountain climbing . 
i really enjoyed skiing . uh , and a lot of outdoor activities . 
uh there's not a whole lot of mountains here in texas 
 that's right . 
but hopefully i will be able to get back to the slopes some day 
oh yeah . 
i have not had the opportunity to go skiing 
but , uh , i grew up in arizona which has some mountains around it 
you didn't ? 
and of course , i was at that you know stage of my life where i had to be taken to places . 
i couldn't go by myself . 
that's true . 
that's true . 
and then of course , once i got to the age where i could have done it myself , i had other interests i guess . 
 oh yeah . 
i guess that for me it was very helpful . 
my two oldest brothers were very interested in skiing . 
oh yeah . 
and so we went quite often 
and , uh , in fact my brother still does a lot of skiing . 
when i lived around in that area my brother would fly in from chicago 
and we would go skiing and enjoy that . 
it's a nice thing to have 
and it's good to fall back on those hobbies when you have time to . like you mentioned 
and i am finding out , a lot of the spare time that i had isn't there . 
that's right . 
uh , it's , uh , taken up by activities with , uh , work , with family , with , uh , civic and church responsibilities for me . 
i make i have to make myself realize that it is important to get out there and you know just even to go for a walk is good recreation for me .
 oh yeah . 
and my youngest daughter is going to be starting up soccer 
so she's real excited about doing that . 
well , great . 
we will be busy with that again . 
so you have participated with that in the past ? 
pardon me ? 
 and she was in it for a few years , 
but she has got so many interests herself that ,
and well the first one to go . 
she still likes her piano 
 and she is in band . 
so , she's got lots of hobbies or , uh , activities going on . 
it sounds like her life is full too . 
i imagine your life is full 
very much . 
that's right .
all right . 
well , leslie , it's been very nice talking to you . 
is there anything else that you would like to 
i think we covered it pretty good . 
oh , okay . 
thank you for calling . 
and you have a nice evening . 
you too . 
what kind of fishing do you do ? 
well , it's mostly from the rivers and lakes . 
in california ? 
and , yes , 
i don't like to go out on boats . 
well , what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods ? 
well , it , uh , 
but , i like it all except , uh , really i don't really care that much for the trout . 
i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout .
well , i don't blame you . 
i grew up in nebraska and , uh , grew up cat fishing in the little blue river 
and then , uh , we moved to , uh , south dakota 
and , uh , now that we are down here , i think a lot of people do some , uh , bass fishing and strip bass fishing 
but , uh , uh , i am sort of a catfish man at heart . 
see . well , uh , like in , uh , iowa and nebraska , those little bullheads , they look just like catfish , huh ? 
you know that's what i mean cause i am from iowa . 
and , uh , you know , we use to catch those little bullheads 
and that's , 
they look just like baby catfish . 
you know , uh , did you get to go fishing very often ? 
oh yeah . 
the only problem is i just moved to texas 
so it's been a little over a year now 
but , uh 
and i , really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now 
 and it's driving me crazy 
but , uh , one of these days , i will go over to , uh , lake lewisville or , uh , .
well , uh , you like to eat them after you catch them ? 
well , yeah , 
because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing , 
 well mo , 
most of the time , uh , if we catch something , we'll take it home and eat it . 
uh , and you're right . 
i mean i like to fish for trout 
and they are really , uh , uh , good fighters 
but , uh , if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu . 
i know . 
 well , uh , so , do you just , uh , uh , skin your catfish 
or do you fillet them out , 
how do you , 
we , uh , skin them . 
do you ? 
just cut their heads off and skin them 
and then i just , uh , flour them , salt and pepper them and cook them . 
i don't put that corn meal on them . 
you know , uh , that's the way my mother taught me to fry them 
so  , 
well , that's how we do it too . 
uh , although we , uh , use to set some , uh , trout lines out 
and we've caught , you know , fourteen , fifteen pound catfish 
and sometimes those are good to , uh , do on a barbecue grill 
 and then the skin just basically scrapes right off 
and , uh , wer , 
and it really tastes pretty good . 
well you know , i don't think i've ever tried cooking those , uh , catfish quite that big . 
there , uh , 
uh , most of them are just the small , you know , pan frying ones . 
so , uh , 
well , i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on , uh , a rod and reel 
but , uh 
 wouldn't that be something ? 
and , uh , well up in , uh , south dakota in the missouri river there we've , uh , tied into a few northern pike 
and , uh , they really , uh , 
when the water is cold , they are very slow moving fish , 
but in the summer time , they'll , uh , give you a run for your money . 
so when you were , 
when you did go fishing where did you go ? 
you moved there from where ? 
so , it was just like the rivers and , uh , the 
uh , yeah . 
and a lot of them ended up being close to the river , 
so if the river every , uh , flooded , you know , then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits 
 and so we would do a lot of fishing there too 
but , uh , south dakota didn't really have much for , 
afternoon , doug , 
it certainly is , uh , going to be a pleasure to chat with you . 
me too . 
well , okay . 
all right . 
well , now , what would you say about these everyday invasions of our privacy ? 
what ideas do you have on that , doug ? 
um , see , i'm not sure that , 
i don't think they're necessarily widespread in this country , 
but i think that the opportunity is definitely there for , um , people to invade your privacy when they want to , 
i think it's , um , 
in what manner ? 
well , it's certainly not that difficult to tap a phone . 
it's completely trivial to , for instance , listen in on someone's car phone or walk around phone , since they're just radio signals . 
it's , um , 
and let's see , 
well , what's the first thing that comes to your mind ? 
well , the thing that i thought they were , uh , concerned about was people calling on the phone from all over the country to sell you something 
 and in reality in many cases , they knew , or they had information about you that was purchased from some other organizations . 
and i thought was , uh , beginning to invade the privacy of people , because the things about where you live and maybe what you purchased in past months is then put down and sent to someone else in the same business , 
and they in return , come back and try to sell you something with this additional knowledge . 
to me that's an invasion of privacy . 
i agree with you there , for sure . 
um , and i think that all that information is quite easy for anyone to get . 
it's possible for almost anyone to get information about your credit history , for instance , if they just , um , twist the right arm or claim to be from the right organization when they're calling the credit company . 
it's , you know , possible for a thirteen year old hacker with a modem to find out almost anything about your personal history , not to mention , change it if he wants to . 
well , um . 
well , yes , 
well , for instance , yes , um , 
do you consider these serious , uh , problems ? 
but i think they have the potential of becoming serious problems . 
well , what should we do about it , 
or what could be done about it , do you think 
and there are certainly benefits to its doing so , 
and it's hard to say whether the , um , risks have potential of outweighing the benefits or not , 
and i'm not sure what can be done to ensure that they don't . 
do you see any out for us ? 
i mean , it should be made a , uh , national or a state law to protect people so that , uh , you would then feel more free to deal direct with these companies . 
in other words , if you call the company yourself , directly , uh , and then know that what you tell them will be on their records but will not be available to anyone else , uh , you know , from the outside , so to speak 
 but we have no control of that now 
 and then , uh , you feel that it someday might be used against you . 
 uh , i basically , uh , listen to the news from the t v . 
that's probably the only time i get a chance to , uh , uh , take a look at it is the evening news 
and then if i'm lucky , i might be able to hear something through news wise . 
but , uh , other than that that's probably how i get my source unless something really tragic happens and somebody tells me it about uh , uh , you know , uh , through conversation or whatever 
but , uh , most of the time it is through the news in the evening 
so that's about the , 
you don't get any newspapers ? 
uh , not that i don't enjoy newspapers or anything like that 
but , uh , part of it is because i just don't feel like i need , to have them , uh , with watching the t v or whatever . 
we get our weekly news around the area 
and i might look through it real quick if there's something that catches my interest , uh , in regards to what's going on around the county or little bit of the state .
but the majority of the time now i don't get a daily newspaper where , you know , i get tons of , uh , news coming in that kind of stuff . 
i'm kind of the opposite of you . 
i get all my news from newspapers . 
 oh , you do  ? 
 we have two newspapers . 
you read it in the morning then ? 
and , uh 
so , uh , see what , uh , i'm quoted in . 
oh , sure .
but , uh , how bad the quotes are every day . 
to see if they did it or if they , uh , criticize you or 
 or , uh , sometimes there's , uh , letter to the editor about me 
or there's a , even , uh , editorials 
even if i'm on it . 
 but just , 
 well , that's kind of like you said then . 
we are kind of on the opposite where i get home and , uh , while i'm cooking supper the t v is on and watching the news or trying to catch up with what is going on 
and , uh , very seldom do i catch the ten o'clock 
so , by that time , you know , old news is probably what i hear through the grapevine or whatever . 
but , uh , unless there is a big issue going on like when we were at war then i think everybody was glued to the t v to find out what was going on . 
but , uh , other than that , no . 
 and that's , 
c n n had the , uh , 
everybody was watching c n n , 
that seemed to be the place to be 
well it brought kind of , uh , more of a vivid , uh , look at what was going on when they were dropping the bombs and just a lot of different things . 
but , uh , yeah , 
that's true . 
you know  , you know a lot of people that read the newspapers to get the news of what's going on 
and , uh , other people that , you know , do it differently or don't even watch any news at all 
well , the thing is , i , uh , 
a lot of times uh , what's going on . 
exactly happens . 
 and , uh , that's a problem that i have is not , getting just a little brief , uh , idea of what's happening . 
 oh sure , 
a clip , you know , a sentence or two 
and that's about it of what went on 
and , uh , they have so much other information to cover in such a short period of time . 
makes sense . 
so , i wa , 
i always turn that on   
that's one part i watch because uh , i go surfing down here 
and i always 
so you're right on the coast line . 
you're not , uh , further up . 
i suppose you watch for hurricanes coming in and 
 weather channel's good .
this is what is expected , 
but a lot of times things happen and change here so drastically , uh , so fast 
so i can predict my week and 
so i can be at the beach when the waves start coming in . 
 to take off . 
sounds pretty good 
 so , what is your opinion on drug testing ? 
 well i can see it in certain cases where uh , somebody's in a position that , uh , perhaps a lot of lives are involved , like , maybe , uh , pilots that , uh , you know , fly jets 
and , uh , maybe people that have a lot of responsibility over a large mass of people . 
i could certainly see it being done 
but , in general , uh , you know , 
whether companies want to do this 
and i know that companies do . 
like factory workers that have lots of accidents are now being drug tested . 
i know a couple of corporations that are doing that . 
but there's got to be like a limitation . 
do we drug test everybody that comes in 
or do we kind of say , well you can be drug tested 
and you look okay because you look this way . 
you're very conservative 
and there's just no way that we would think that you would use drugs 
but the guy that doesn't fit the stereotype of , uh , the conservative or whatever could be drug tested . 
uh , you know , whether legal rights of that person , 
i don't know . 
there's certainly a lot of things to really consider , uh , when you get into drug testing people just at the work place unless , of course , like i said , they have a large responsibility over a mass of people 
 uh , that's about it . 
 well , yeah , 
it's just not the com , 
you're talking about company's liability . 
and i think that's what companies are doing , uh , more and more because there are products that are out there . 
and there's also the case about just , uh , uh , health and welfare of the , uh , employees . 
if a company has a healthy work force , their 
 and uh , financial benefits associated 
 the only thing is , 
   that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is going to be more healthy 
i don't think anybody 
the only thing is , uh , 
the one issue that i would take stands with is the fact that the drug testing itself can be done on a person that is actually not on drugs and come out positive . 
if they have had like , uh , medications in the past , let's say , once a month or twice a month or three times a month or maybe that week they take an advil 
and the advil will , apparently , come out positive as if they smoked marijuana . 
uh , and there's poppy seed type things . 
i think that everybody is aware of that 
but , uh , where's the line where you say to somebody , i'm going to drug test you tomorrow 
so please do not take these medications 
or where's , 
 you know 
 well , wel , 
the ques , 
the question becomes what do you do about somebody who tests positive . 
that's where the real sticking point comes in . 
it's not , 
i don't think there's any problem with testing people . 
it's what do you do with the information ? 
and the only thing that i would say on that is it could blacklist an employee later on . 
let's say , uh , you've taken medication of some sort , even though they usually have you , at the time , list what medications you've taken . 
uh , let's say you do come out positive 
and you've taken advil or any of the ibuprofen products out there . 
or you've had a cold 
and you've been on medication or whatever , 
you come out positive . 
is it then the chance that the employer will look at you in more of a negative fashion and say well , you know , this is kind of iffy , you know , 
are they really on drugs 
or they on drugs , 
you know what i'm saying . 
or they may make up their mind that let's get rid of this employee , 
you know what i'm 
well , yeah . 
the employee should not be privy to the information of drug testing . 
that should go to an entirely different , uh , agency within a corporation . 
 and it's a , 
they can that the , 
if it does come out positive the first time , they need to go back and find out what medications did that person take , 
you know what i mean ? 
it's kind of like , uh , 
i think most people are aware , at least now , common knowledge is that  , 
uh , i don't know . 
your camping experience is probably , 
i don't know if they're similar to mine 
but , uh , since i've had children it has changed a little bit , 
but , uh , when my husband and i were , uh , camping , we'd take this domed tent that , uh , is easily collapsible and , uh , go camping and , uh , just kind of roughed it . 
as long as there was a bathroom there and some clean showers and things like that , then it was fine . 
but , uh , we'd get up at three in the morning and start on our little , uh , escapade for the day and , uh , kind of , uh , do a lot of different things and then stop when we wanted to . 
but , uh , that's kind of changed now . 
when you have a small child because they don't want to get up at three in the morning 
and you don't want them up that early . 
would you then go hiking . 
i mean would the camping be part of a long hike ? 
oh yeah , 
we'd stop when we wanted to , that kind of stuff . 
so , we kind of did a little bit of hiking , sure , and a little bit of , uh , sightseeing , uh , different areas . uh , sitting back at different areas and spending hours , 
we never had really a time limit , 
we just kind of did what we wanted 
very comfortable , 
were you up in wisconsin 
or would you go into can , 
where would you camp    ? 
 well , there's , uh , places in wisconsin . 
there's the apostle islands , uh 
and then there's also , uh , what we found , uh , in the state of , uh , south dakota , the black hills . 
oh , yeah . 
that's beautiful . 
 and we just have this , uh , really good time there . 
one thing is they don't have mosquitoes 
and , uh , sorry to say , 
so , that kind of puts a little bit of a hamper on your , uh , you know , 
if you're going to go camping , who wants to deal with bugs 
and , uh 
 we found this one area that doesn't have mosquitoes . 
they just don't have them 
and it's just wonderful not to be bugged all night long with a humming mosquito at your ear , 
oh , yeah . 
well , most of my camping , 
i haven't done much since i was a kid 
 but , uh , we'd , basically , take the tent up in the sierras and , uh , usually just camp near some stream 
and , uh , just , 
it wasn't even a full tent . 
it would be more a tarp , uh 
 and , uh , we just thought it was absolute heaven . 
uh , there was certainly nothing like a bathroom , a shower or anything ,
it was dig your own hole 
and , uh 
that was really called roughing it , 
 but it , uh , uh , 
actually some friends of mine and i are planning to camp this summer , uh , for four days . 
 and i have a idea it's going to be a lot more equipment and a lot more stuff than 
than you , 
than when you were younger , 
with kids they don't care if they take a shower everyday . 
with kids they don't care , you know , uh , about a lot of things . 
i just don't feel right 
so . there's lots of places if you're going to go camping . 
k o a s are wonderful . 
 , it's kind of the , uh , yuppie type of camping because they have showers , 
they have things for kids to do . 
they have swimming pools , things like that . 
if you 
 oh , my . 
we have found state parks , not that they're lacking 
but , uh , they're certainly not up to a standard of a k o a where it's , you know , a little bit cleaner . 
you've got the showers available . 
it's not , you know , in the same category . 
state parks , you know , you get a little bit fearful too , uh , you know , things like that simply because it , they are supposed to be patrolled 
but , uh , you know , it's a little bit different . 
so we've always kind of stayed with a k o a and then , uh , did other things besides just sit at the campground at night . 
that's the only time you really use your campground . 
if you're going to be gone all day long , walking someplace or doing tourism or whatever 
so we never really spent that much time at the campground as much as we did , 
 so interesting political trends or events , huh ? 
well , i guess the , uh , most interesting one that's , uh , going on right now , from my perspective , is this , uh , phenomena of , uh , uh , ross perot . 
uh , caught his interview last night with david frost 
and it was 
i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in . 
but the whole phenomena of him coming out of , uh , literally nowhere and no party . uh , at least , no apparent party support on either side is 
i have not even heard , believe it or not , of that person . 
i'm not kidding . 
when you said it , it was kind of like a surprise . 
like out of nowhere ? 
as far as 
like now , the new house bill that went to minnesota , uh , being that it is their neighboring state and that i lived in minnesota , i'm more familiar with the politics that involved with that , and that being passed . 
but , uh , as far as politics in the grander , uh , part of it as if you want to look at , uh , election type things , i'm not quite sure even if i'm going to vote . 
 well , it seems that the decision , so far , has been filtered 
you know , the , 
a contender within the party is to have done all those things . 
 i mean , and preparing himself for the presidency 
and now it seems like both he and the incumbent president are , you know , pretty seriously threatened by somebody who comes out of a whole nonpolitical arena . 
he might be one of those , 
uh , it's kind of when you think back of the old politics where a dirt farmer , uh , 
when you think of some of the best presidents we've had , in the past , have been people that have struggled to get to the top . 
i mean , they were not rich in 
and it has been kind of , in the past , uh , i don't know , maybe fifty years that in order for a person to get involved with politics , they've had to have money . 
and you had to have the views of the people that were going to be paying your way . 
uh , so it makes the common person , uh , 
not to say that a common person couldn't run for government and do a fabulous job because he's got people that are quite intelligent 
and i don't know if we'll ever see that you know . where a common person could ever get in there that has good moral standings and , uh , has , uh , you know , 
you think of abraham lincoln and , you know , just the background of 
he didn't go to college . 
he didn't , you know , do all the other things that , uh , you know , you would think that was real popular to do and to get politically involved in and have money . 
he didn't come 
 uh , and now it's , 
a consummate politician in the sense that , uh , not only did he , uh , fail in business twice with bankruptcy and failure 
 but he lost some eighteen elections before he finally won one . 
and the first and only election he won was , uh , the presidency .
he had lost every other office that he had , you know , 
he was appointed a couple of times to , like , uh , uh , state legislator . 
so you really know a lot of his background . 
then when he finally , you know , did win an election , uh , you know , it was the presidency . 
it was the big one . 
it's the one that everybody wants . 
whether or not i , you know , 
you look at all these candidates that want to become president . 
i really have to ask them why , you know . 
uh , it's the toughest job in the world to do . 
and not only that , you don't have that much freedom to make choices . 
i mean you 
you have to go the house , the congress , and all of the other things 
and sure you can  , veto it at the last minute 
but then it's not like you have all that power 
and i think long time ago presidents did have a lot of power . 
um , hello , um , 
what is your favorite , um , food for a dinner party ? 
um , i don't know , 
i think i make things , you know , 
i do things kind of simple because you know , i just have close friends over . 
i make like lasagna 
and , uh , oh , we like to have barbecues outside you know , when the weather's nice because in texas you have a lot of nice weather , 
so , we do a lot of , um , things like that . 
um , i'm not really into gourmet cooking , 
so , i don't know how to do that , 
so , i don't have gourmet foods .
do you do texmex ? 
um , yeah , 
oh , fajitas , 
how do you make fajitas ? 
um , it's kind of like made out of  skirt  steak 
and you marinate it . 
you can buy marinating mixes here 
i don't know ,
uh , you can , you know , marinate it in any kind of barbecue sauce you like 
and then not deep frying it 
but you can either barbecue it which is really good ,
and , uh , then you put it on a flour , like , you know , 
you make your meat real , uh , thin , you know , bitesize pieces . 
then you put it on flour tortillas with , you know , guacamole and , uh , sour cream and , you know , all kinds of , you know , 
it's like a texmex type thing . 
oh , it sounds good . 
it's really good . 
you can do it with chicken too . 
chicken fajitas and stuff . 
well , that's nice . 
so , what kind of cooking do you do up there ? 
oh , well , basically , um , because i lived in the middle east for a while i tend to fix middle eastern foods when i have , 
and so , um , some of the dips are like  chick  peas mashed with , um , sesame . 
and , uh , cold foo , um , 
what's it called , 
i forgot ,  , what it's called , 
anyway and my , 
you cook them so often you kind of forget their names . 
it's called    , 
now i remember it . 
and , um , dipping arabic bread , the thin  piece  of bread in that . 
or another dip is very similar but with , um , eggplant which has been actually barbe , 
it ends up with a barbecued taste . 
although we usually bake it in the oven 
or if we have , uh , 
those of us that have gas stoves bake it on top just like putting it in the gas flame and sort of getting it black ,
oh , that's unusual i'd never heard of anything like that , you know . 
here in texas it's all , you know , texmex cooking and barbecue 
but barbecue is it like steaks 
or is it ,
you barbecue s , 
pardon me ? 
oh , yeah , 
but i cook my turkeys inside , you know , 
it b , 
you can buy smoked turkeys . 
uh , but most the stuff that we barbecue is like steak and chicken and hamburgers , hot dogs ,
the simple things like that , 
you know , barbecue beans and baked beans 
i'm sure that the chicken that we barbecue from the middle east has a lemon garlic sauce . 
i wouldn't imagine that a barbecued chicken would . 
depending on the barbe , 
it's like a smokey flavor ,
it's totally different . 
sounds like it would be interesting to eat some of the middle eastern cooking , 
well , it's been fun talking to you . 
it's been nice , 
it's , uh , you know , new to learn what different people eat , 
i come from wyoming 
and it's basically the same type of thing except for you do eat more the texmex down here , 
uh , in wyoming it would be less spicy ? 
you , you know , 
down there it's just like meat and potatoes , you know . 
vegetables once in a while . 
oh , dear . 
well , it's been interesting to talk to you . 
very good . 
thank you for calling . 
why do you think the apathy exists ? 
i blame it to apathy . 
um , that their vote doesn't count anyway . 
i mean , um , if your vote won't make a difference . 
so for instance , in , um , the last presidential election , i'm sure a lot of people thought , oh , bush is going to win either way , 
why bother voting . 
why should i go out of my way when it doesn't matter . 
that's right . 
i think that's , 
so are only the same two caucuses , certainly not going to win , why bother voting for him . 
so . a big reason for it . 
how abou , 
oh , i think so , too . 
and i think the other thing is the news had it predetermined with a half of one percent voting , you know . 
um , that's true . 
actually i never thought about that , 
that's a good rea , 
and you know , you start out in the morning , and all day you hear the news , 
that's true , 
what do you think on the local elections though ? 
i think on the local elections it's actually , um , 
um , i think people vote in the larger elections because they feel like , well , you know , the country's real important , 
and , you know , then the whole country will be saved . 
but they figure local elections don't mean that much , i suspect . 
so people don't really worry about their local mayor or something , you know , and stuff like that . 
so people think that it doesn't matter as much , whereas i think it's probably just the opposite is true . 
i think it's probably the case that people could have more effect on a local level . 
oh , i think so , too . 
uh , i think another thing , 
and uh , i'm making a judgment here that may or may , 
i think it is totally wrong , 
i think that the people that have , um , a lower income , which you automatically equate with lower education 
and they don't register , 
and they don't understand that you can't go and vote and register all at the same time , 
 and i believe in this , 
that's possible . 
i still think that a lot of those people are the ones who really think that their votes don't make a difference , though , as well . 
my vote's not going to count anyway . 
you know , and i think that's probably a portion of the population that massively under represent , 
i would guess that that portion of the population is massively under represented . 
i had an interesting comment one time , a thought that would never have crossed my mind . 
what do they have to do with one another ? 
 i just wandered off from that one . 
i was just so surprised and amazed with the statement that they say only registered voters can be picked for jury selection . 
oh , so they didn't want to wind up being a juror ever . 
so they wor , 
if they don't vote , they don't have to be on a jury . 
oh , i didn't realize that actually . 
there is convoluted logic for you . 
there is . 
there are much easier ways to get out of jury duty . 
i can spot a guilty person a mile away . 
oh , i just , 
there are so many other ways . 
but that one , it just defeated me . 
i didn't have any answer for that one . 
that one was just beyond my imagination . 
well , responsibilities . 
that's a good point , 
you're probably right . 
i don't want to serve on jury duty , 
i don't want to vote , 
i don't want to do this and that . 
well , then they could , you know , put them in the reverse situation , in the place where they don't have the right to be on jury duty 
and they don't have the right to vote 
i suspect their opinions would change very quickly . 
and that was what i was thinking exactly about because in the soviet union they had an election , 
and they had , like a ninetyeight percent turnout . 
a massive turnout . 
at last , someone wants us to vote . 
they were standing in lines to vote . 
they were doing that . 
unfortunately , they had no idea what they were voting on it turns out . 
and their vote didn't count .
that's right . 
but it's the thought , they all got out .
but you wonder , if now the next election they have , if only half of them are going to show up . 
or how many generations it will take until only half of the voters show up in russia . 
or any one shows up . 
that's true . 
total indifference , you know , 
what difference does it make . 
now if things go the way that they are there , i think that they'll keep voting , 
but i think they'll wind up like us at some point , where only half of them will end up voting , and sort of caring enough to really make a statement , 
so . you know , when you've got an underdog candidate who represents something , and even if he doesn't win , a large number of people voting for that particular candidate does , i think , make a statement 
i think 
and i think that's real important . 
oh and i think women turn out to vote for women , too . 
that's probably true . 
i thin , 
well , i know it's true . 
you see a lot of that . you know , rally behind the female . 
she may lose , 
but by golly we're going to make a statement here 
that's good , 
that's actually really good . 
well , act , 
actually the female who i would most rally behind right now , the way she makes speeches is a local person for you , is ann richards . 
oh , okay . 
i don't know her politics . 
i just know that , uh , i saw her speak in the eightyfour democratic convention . 
and right then and there , if they said to me vote for someone for president , i would have slapped down my vote for ann richards . 
was that the time , 
that was eightyfour , 
that's too soon . 
and she did it backwards in high heels . 
that's very good . 
she said that , 
i didn't . 
said , you know , 
don't tell me what women can do . 
that's very good . 
i like that . 
so uh , i would vote for her , 
and i suspect she could get a large voter turnout . 
i think i did vote for her , as a matter of fact . 
i'm pretty sure i did . 
say , that people like that , 
i think inflammatory politicians are , um , 
or , or emotional politicians , certain very vibrant politicians tend to bring crowds out , i think . 
i would hope . 
well , and some of the issues are so emotional . 
you know , some of the really emotional ones . 
have you followed the dallas elections on zoning ? 
but not necessarily the , 
i've heard it's very controversial though . 
everyone has made so many statements . 
i don't live in dallas county . 
but , i've heard so many statements that i've lost track . 
i honestly at this point , 
it's just too blown out of proportion for everyone . 
you really , 
even the news . you cannot follow 
i don't really know if some of the poor judges that are trying to decide how it should be divided . 
i wonder about them at some point . 
um , uhhuh . 
well , they were elected as well , 
that's correct . 
and that's another interesting question . 
should judges be elected or appointed . 
that's true , 
that's true . 
are they politicians , 
and you don't want a judge to be appointed because you don't want someone's friend to be a judge . 
but on the other hand , 
or you want to take the other side of it , you can argue , 
that's one of those you can pick either side 
 and we could spend a lot of time on it 
that's right . 
it's situational , really . 
so , how do you think we can get people to vote ? 
uh , uh , 
i've had one idea that i think is completely undoable , 
but i think , 
but i suspect it would work . 
and the way to do it is to get an absolutely atrocious candidate , who you never expect to win , to go out and make inflammatory and ridiculous and stupid statements , so that a large population of voters will go out and vote against that person for someone else . 
so given a choice between , you know , 
so that , 
so if you have , 
so if , 
imagine a world where you have two real candidates and one idiot who goes out and makes , you know , you know , sort of , um , anti women statements , anti semitic statements , anti black statements , et cetera , et cetera , 
well then i suspect a lot of people would go out and choose a candidate to vote just to spite that person . 
but i don't think 
well , this is true , 
i was worrying along the lines of you get every time someone puts in a ballot in a ballot box 
 that's an interesting notion . 
that might work in some places . 
that would be interesting , 
yeah  . . . 
so , uh , then , do you keep kids ? 
is this two year old yours 
or do you keep children for other people ? 
i have a two year old and a three and a half year old . 
oh , that's exactly what i have . 
that's wild . 
i know . 
my little girl was three and a half in march 
and my son was two in january . 
oh , boy . 
well , mine was two in march 
and the three and a half year old will be four in july . 
that's pretty close . 
but i'm home with the kids all day 
and i have really , uh , tried to make that a priority even though it's financially a big strain on us . 
it is . 
have you been able to do that all along 
uh , i work parttime 
but , uh , my husband's able , you know , mostly to take care of them when i'm working . 
oh , how neat . 
 and that was another reason why i really wanted to be here because , you know , they have had a couple foster homes already . 
how old were they when you adopted ? 
the baby was eleven weeks old 
 and his brother was 
 so he probably doesn't remember . 
definitely needed . 
well , pretty interesting . 
well , i have always wanted to be able to stay home with my kids 
that was always my dream , you know . 
i wasn't necessarily a career person 
 but as long as i was single and had to work , i was going to get a good job and do the best i could . 
and my husband was in the type of business that , you know , 
it's insurance 
so you have to build a clientele 
and by the time we had kids i couldn't quit . 
 oh , boy . 
 and so i haven't been able to quit yet . 
so i've had to deal a lot with child care 
and course , we're hoping within , hopefully , the next two years i'll be able to quit and stay home . 
but , uh , i started out , uh , 
my best friend kept my kids from the time my daughter was born 
 oh , that's neat . 
and it worked out pretty good . 
you know , we had always said from the beginning that if it gets in the way of the friendship then i'll take them somewhere else . 
you know , the friendship is more important . 
 and , uh , it was a wonderful experience for my kids because she really loved them , you know . 
she loved them like they were hers 
and i 
i had good peace of mind . 
i knew that they were taken care of 
that's the hardest thing i think , you know 
i put , uh , my oldest in a preschool program just for him to have the experience of 
and , uh , he was in there for three months when i pulled him out 
and the teacher had eleven kids . 
it was excellent , supposedly . 
the reputation was fantastic for this place . 
was supposed to be an excellent school 
and i had several friends who had recommended it , too . 
but it really gets down to the particular teacher . 
and she was a new teacher at the school 
and she had eleven , you know , three year olds in a room 
and i just think it was way too much . 
the were almost all boys . 
 but she had no help ? 
she was alone with them . 
oh , that is hard . 
and she was just my , uh , 
three year old is real active . 
and she just kept saying how wild he was . 
well , you know , there was kind of a connotation there of you know , it being a problem . 
like he ran back from the bathroom singing and skipping she said . 
well , you know , at three years old 
i don't either .
i mean , it's kind of like there was so much going on that she felt like she needed to control more 
 and it's really hard to con , 
you can't control eleven three year olds with one person , you know . 
you have to let them have some wild time 
yeah , you know . 
so i just finally took him out . plus financial reasons . 
it was expensive . 
but i was real careful and visited and everything ahead of time . 
but i still felt like even after all the checking i did , you know , you really can't know everything 
i felt safe that the kids weren't going to be left alone somewhere in a room where a teacher could do something inappropriate with them , you know , because 
 and i 
that they would would be safe 
well , when my friend decided to go back to work , and whenever we had problems , it worked out okay because she would come and tell me 
and we'd work it out . 
after that , i found another girl that had gone to church with us that , you know , they needed it financially . 
she had a little boy that was the same age as my little boy 
and i though , 
but she came to our house 
and that just did not work . 
uh , i mean , she loved the kids 
and she was good with them . 
but , uh , you know , they were filthy when i'd get home . 
now i understand kids go out and play 
and they get dirty 
 but i mean filthy . 
i'm talking sand in the ears and the eyes and the hair 
and the 
 oh , gosh . 
 and i was , like , gosh . 
and then , you know , my own furniture and stuff was like , you know , 
the kitchen table , i'd find peanut butter and jelly all over the table and the chairs 
and the , 
you had to come home and clean before you could 
and clean , 
and i was like , 
and then , in the end , uh , she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me 
so i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth . 
she told me about five thirty one afternoon , it was a friday , that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of monday morning . 
 oh gosh . 
 well , you know , i work eight to five thirty 
so what am i supposed to do .
so well , i had been sick 
and i , 
it ended up that i didn't go to work monday because i was sick . 
so i stayed home with them 
and we went to some of the kindercares . 
oh , yeah . 
i took the kids there once just to try it . 
they had a free day at kindercare . 
well , that's what they said . 
there were two pretty near our house 
so i lined up someone tuesday . 
they had a mother's day out that my babysitter took them to , you know , which was fine . 
they liked it . 
they had been going to it for years . 
and so i stayed with them monday . 
tuesday they went to that . 
wednesday i took them to one kindercare . 
thursday i took them to another kindercare 
and then friday my husband and i split . 
but on thursday i didn't like the kindercares . 
i didn't either . 
i had 
they didn't give him . 
and the other one was that the younger one got bit 
oh , that's horrible . 
 and doing something with him . 
well , not only was it going to cost me like a hundred and fifty dollars more a month , which i didn't have 
we're a christian family 
and , you know , because they're , you know , like public , they're not private 
they can't talk about god . 
they can't do anything like that 
and i don't want them indoctrinated 
 so you feel like your values aren't getting , 
god loves you . 
 you know , basic things like that . 
so , uh , i talked to another lady at church . 
it was like thursday of that week 
and i've know this girl , 
i went to college with her 
so i value her opinion . 
and she told me about a private one . 
it was associated with one of the churches here . 
it's not the church i go to 
but it was lubbock view christian church 
and it's a private academy . 
and so i went over there 
and i talked to the lady . 
well , they have like a three year waiting list . 
and she has a three year old and a toddler , which mine was at the time . 
and so friday afternoon at five thirty , she called me 
you can bring your kids monday .
oh , what luck . 
i know . 
i was just like , god set this ,
he knew i needed this 
uh , so since october then , they have been going there 
and i , 
i love it . 
i have been at 
 oh , that's great . 
it's just been better than even when they were with my best friend because we don't have the little day to day hassles 
 oh , really ? 
did you hear my printer in the background . 
i'm sorry . 
i hope you can understand what i s , .
that's okay .
i got the dryer going 
i was only about twenty dollars more a month than i was paying because being a private institution they're nonprofit . 
 so , they don't have to charge as much . 
 oh , that's great . 
 and the hours are wonderful 
 and i think it's the best thing . 
i told russ that we should have done this a long time ago 
it's great . 
so i guess as long as i have to work , i feel good that they're there . 
they're getting the love , the care . 
they have a little curriculum . 
they teach them , you know , the alphabet , the numbers , the things which , you know , if they learn , they learn . 
if they don't , they don't . 
i don't feel like i have to indoctrinate them by age three 
 but it's kind of neat when they 
they think it's fun . 
it's not a big , you know 
 oh , and the teachers . 
well , taylor got bit several times 
and taylor bit several times 
and the teachers dealt with that . 
and we keep them apart 
and we scold them 
and we correct them 
and , you know , they mark it all down 
and they let you know 
 and , you know , they get over it real quick 
and he doesn't do it anymore 
i just 
so mu , 
i don't know . 
i just feel like a big burden was lifted .
because sometimes it is a burden having them all day because i can't 
it is . 
i can't even go grocery shopping right now 
and the older brother is you know , running around all over the place 
well , and it , you know , 
but i understa , 
i wish you could find a good mother's day out because that would be good for your 
i need to . 
even for just a couple mornings a week or something 
so i think i'm going to look for that . 
remind me of that now that you mention it .
 and that's not that big a deal , you know . 
for a couple times .
and that's usually like , you know , 
i don't know when mine were going to mother's day out , 
it was like from nine to three 
so that was a pretty good 
my babysitter would take them and then pick them up . 
so , that worked out real good . 
that's sounds good . 
well , i'm tickled to death . 
i hope you find something 
 well , thanks . 
did we cover everything we need to ? 
well , i guess . 
 and i think we both listed an experience .
well , great . 
well , thanks a lot . 
you have a good day . 
 and you too . 
i was thinking about camping and people's ideas about it . 
we've even seen people with these campers 
and they got the big old antennas up so they can watch their t v when they're going . 
right or their 
that's not , 
on top of the recreational vehicles . 
oh , golly! .
that's not the kind we do . 
do you go camping ? 
and we've just gotten one of those little tents  ,
and that's what we camp in . 
so we kind of rough it . 
well , so do we . 
in fact , when we first got married , we would try to take these trips to minnesota to see his family 
 and we didn't have a tent or any camping supplies 
so we'd sleep on those picnic tables at roadside parks . 
 oh no . 
i mean , i know it's dangerous , 
i wouldn't do it now 
but we did .
 and one time we went to yellowstone 
and we were doing the same thing . 
we couldn't find a place to camp 
and so we were on top of a picnic table with our sleeping bags i guess . 
and this ranger comes up with this light , shines it on us and said that we're just bear bait out there . we had our food 
gosh . bear bait .
that would make me nervous .
have you done any camping around here ? 
and we go up there fairly often .
sometimes we get a lot of people together to do it . 
that sounds fun . 
and we've done things like when it's kind of cold . 
we take extension cords 
and we've all got heaters in our tents . 
and in the summer   .
same thing , we get our extension cords running from all these tents 
but we've got the fans going . 
so we're not roughing it too much . 
and we have taken t v s out there for the kids .
and they've got their electrical hookups . 
so it's not so bad . 
do you go on long ? 
i think the longest we've stayed out there is like five days . 
and they had a library at one time out there . 
so that's really not roughing it so much 
that's kind of different . 
and a pool to go to . 
that would be nice . 
and there was nobody else ,
and it was just really nice , that time of year . 
we had taken our electric ,
but we didn't need it .
 well my husband has even camped at lake lavon 
 oh really ? 
he just decided to take the kids out there . 
i mean it's not very many miles from our house at all . 
but they had the time of their lives , you know . 
oh , yeah 
had the boat just pulled up right by the tents . 
it wasn't bad . 
that sounds nice . 
and we've taken ,
and it ended up , when it came time for us to pull in for the night , we'd take a vote . 
and most of the time we decided we wanted to stay in a hotel . 
instead of getting out all that stuff , you know . 
it's a lot of work to set up just for one night . 
then you have to get up the next day and move it on . 
but we're set now . 
we've got cook stoves 
and we've got our bug light 
and everybody's got their sleeping bags , 
we got air mattresses . 
we decided that was easier than cots and more comfortable . 
those are nice , 
we have one of those , too . 
 those double ones ? 
pretty good . 
we're on our third one i think . 
how do you blow yours up ? 
we've got an electric pump that hooks into the cigarette lighter . 
we were looking at those in a magazine . 
last time we went , we took our vacuum cleaner with us .
i didn't know you could do that . 
and , yeah , you can , if you can reverse the ,
 and it blows air out instead of sucking it in 
and you can fill them up that way 
but something that's smaller would be a lot more convenient . 
no joke .
i hope you didn't have a big vacuum cleaner . 
so there's plenty of room to hold things . 
now we've used a hair dryer before . 
but i put it on hot and also melted it . 
oh no .
i found that you don't do that . 
i didn't realize it would melt so easily . 
i don't know . 
we take our dog camping . 
she likes to go out and stay in the woods . 
she sleeps in the tent with us . 
it's fun .
i don't like it when there's mosquitos so bad . 
oh , me either . 
and then one night we were camping 
and it came , just a torrential downpour . 
we had the steaks on the grill . 
these people were with us . 
and    , i mean everything was sopping wet inside the tent . 
it was just that bad , you know .
 oh no . 
and we decided we'd just go across the road to the office and see if we could rent anything . 
so i got a condo with a jacuzzi 
and it was wonderful . 
oh boy .
that was lucky . 
it was . 
we've been lucky . 
we've never really been rained on the few times we've gone . 
it's horrible . 
oh i bet it , 
when i was a kid , we camped in virginia 
and we had one of those little pop up tents , which is really nice because it kind of gets you off the ground . 
but it seemed like it rained every weekend for about the year we were really into camping . 
you mean that you put on a truck or what ? 
and , uh , 
oh yeah , 
the little tent comes up the top 
 and it had two double beds in it . 
so do you work for t i ? 
and what exactly are they going to do ? 
oh , they turn them over to somebody 
and i guess they're going to try to teach computers how to recognize voices and search for specific words and stuff . 
so any voice , no matter what the speech pattern or the dialect 
the computers , 
i don't know . 
i type up the tapes of what people talked about . 
oh , that's kind of neat . 
it's sort of interesting . 
do you put all the uhhuhs in here on everything , too . 
all the little stutters and everything . 
what do you write for stutter ? 
that , uh , 
what size stakes to put in .
you need metal instead of plastic . 
and you make sure that you keep up with them for the next time . 
we got one of those kind that have got the , 
oh what is it ? 
they're plastic 
and they've got the elastic on the inside of the poles 
and you just put them together . 
oh , uhhuh . 
that's what we have , too . 
 and it's a dome tent . 
that's what ours is . 
have you ever camped on sand ? 
 um , no . 
that can be a mess . 
we camped at the beach one time 
and that was sort of miserable . 
you just couldn , 
everywhere you went there was sand . 
you couldn't , 
even when you're eating , 
it was in your bed .
i've done it in a shelter . 
 it was  in padre island and in a 
oh well , that's about all   .
well , it's good talking to you . 
are you at t i austin 
but i signed up for this before i did . 
oh , that's great . 
uh , uh , my daughter has talked to , my daughter up here with us , 
i have another one , 
and she's talked to students , uh , 
so i guess they have , uh , sent this to their customers and people in colleges and things . 
so they're , 
if you're a computer user , 
so my daughter has talked to two students , uh , that were non ,
oh , i think that's a , 
so i guess , 
oh , yeah . 
all right . 
have you retired 
or , uh , 
oh , no , 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , i haven't really accomplished that yet , 
but i'm trying . 
oh , yeah , 
uh , that's , 
the finances , 
it is tough . 
uh , i've been with t i , 
i'm just going to be fifteen years this year 
and that's a tough thing , uh , the salary thing . 
t i doesn't quite always do it right . 
well , you should have a lot of information on a budget , then , if you're , uh , 
you're a person who does things better than , 
i don't have a budget . 
that's one of my goals for this year is to try to get myself in a good , oh , longrange planning budget mode . 
um , i'm a single mom 
and i've been just , uh , trying to get , 
well , you deserve an honor for that , a gold star for that , i guess .
thank you , 
it's nice to have someone understand that . 
how about yourself , 
do you have a budget you live by ? 
i do have a longterm budget bec , 
i got a daughter in college and one going to be in college 
so that , i've been thinking about that for quite a while . 
now monthly , no . 
i'll tell you a funny story about budgeting , 
and i've been married twentysix years 
and i did , you know , that the macho thing , 
the man always did the bills for ,
and i got so sick of it , trying to balance the budget , uh , one , 
one day i gave her the checkbook 
you do it , 
you learn it , 
and i've been happy ever since . 
well , that's great . 
how about your , 
she does it all now for about ten years , 
and i don't even , 
she complains to me about it , 
she threatens me to give it back to me , 
so i know it's a big pain to try to do that . 
it really is . 
you know , that was always a major problem in our marriage . 
what i have always identified is i am basically good with money . 
i don't really need a budget to tell me not to spend it . 
you know , i'm always afraid i'm going to need some and where will it be . 
oh , yeah . 
so , um , no , 
um , i sat down and budgeted 
and i had outgo that was much higher than what i had coming in . 
i think , uh , that that is a tough , uh , 
we all , 
seems to be that way . 
i tried to hang onto a house that was way too expensive for me , 
this is the reality . 
this is how much money i have each month . 
the scary thing is , as far as long term , i don't have anything . 
i don't know if you have an i r a or , uh , you know , 
and i've got two girls , also , 
and i haven't saved anything for their college 
i'll give you a hint . 
i don't know if you're a radio talk , uh , person listener . 
do you listen to radio talk shows ? 
listen to bruce williams , uh , for financial advice . 
he's on , oh , 
i don't know what he's going to be in austin . 
he's on five seventy here . 
inter , oh , 
he's nationally famous . 
he's a college graduate type guy . 
he's been in all , 
he's an entrepreneur 
and he gives very practical financial advice about cars , very , you know , not nothing college level , basic stuff . 
his name is bruce williams , 
he's on national radio . 
uh , i don't know ,
you might want to , 
whatever your radio talk shows are down there , he's on that channel . 
well , i'll check that out . 
and i'd listen to talk shows for everything , for gardening and everything , just when i'm doing chores , 
and , uh , 
you've learned a lot . 
and he will help you avoid a lot of little things , uh , financially . 
well , that's good to know how , 
there's a lot of advice out there for how to get a budget . 
and i'm not expert , again , because ,
well , you must have done something . 
you're , you're helping your children in school 
and you're 
i did start a college fund . 
uh , i have one again at u t down there now ,
and she's almost gone through her whole college fund , you know .
excuse me , jim , 
could you hold on ? 
i have someone at the door . 
sure , go ahead . 
thank you . 
i think we might have just screwed up the computer 
but we'll find out . 
oh , no , 
right   , 
uh , the only advice i give you on college would be , there's a lot of scholarship money out there . 
my daughter got a little bit , not much , only first year 
she got about two thousand dollars worth , 
and you ought to , well , as your daughters approach the college age , uh , start finding out about the scholarship monies because there is a lot of money out there 
and , uh , 
and how did your daughter get scholarship money on ? 
uh , band . 
she got , you know , five hundred dollars at a clip through bands , through leadership . 
uh , there's all kinds of civic organ , organizations that will give you , you know , one shot money . 
uh , you get a president's award if in high school doing cer , 
this up here in arlington . uh , 
there's a lot of , 
and , of course , you score high on the s a t ,
you can get yearly money as long as you keep up your grades . 
she did very well in school 
uh , but she only got first year money . 
she got about two thousand dollars . 
it was only five hundred ,
we called . 
there were two or three people , 
there was some little civic organization in dallas that gave money away 
and only two or three people applied . 
she applied and got five hundred dollars from that . 
oh , i'm definitely going to be 
the year that they graduate , you know , before , though , you know , while  they're graduating   , there's all kinds of little bitty money that little clubs will give away , churches and everything , 
and they  don't  even have a dozen applicants because , uh , uh , the kids are going off after the big money . 
uh , of course , you have to have some sort of record in high school , uh , of , of achievement and everything , 
but sometimes it's just , uh , 
like our band gave money away . 
we're a band booster club . 
we give , uh , two five hundred dollar scholarships just to kids , uh , who we think were worthy , you know 
well , that's great to know . 
that's good . 
go ahead , 
you can talk . 
i want to chew up the whole line here . 
oh , well , you're doing just fine , 
when i talk i usually like to ask a lot of questions . 
i was wondering what you do at t i . 
oh , i'm an engineer . 
uh , in fact , i'm working the night because of the cutbacks and everything . 
uh , my job , 
there were three managers jobs that were just dissolved 
and so they put me on nights . 
i call this my recession job . 
oh , goodness . 
and i'm working nights just kind of covering , uh , shutdown equipment and everything ,
i don't mind . 
uh , it beats being laid off and everything . 
and , uh , you , 
oh , absolutely . 
uh , in my old age i'm trying to just hang in there until i get my kids through school 
and then i'd like to teach , maybe mathematics or something . 
i'm trying to study for that now . 
oh , i hope you can do that . 
right , uh , 
what i did is 
i was approached 
i went to t i just right at the time that , uh , my marriage was ending . 
i had been a stay at home mom 
and i really enjoyed it while i was at t i , 
but , you know , the cutbacks were really getting to be rather frightening 
and i had less than five years 
and , also , i wanted to make a little bit more money . 
so i decided i'd like to go out and try sales . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , i'm out trying to sell telephone systems to businesses . 
and the potential there is fantastic . 
oh , sure . 
the reality of it is it's tough .
well , it's tough right now for everybody . 
up here in the dallas metroplex it's awful . 
hey , i've got another clue for you for college . 
go to work for u t . 
uh , we have a friend who is a secretary for t c u , you know , up here ? 
they give you scholarship , a hundred percent , if you work for t c u . 
they do ? 
i'm going to check that . 
i've got , 
i didn't know that all . 
ask them about it . 
call them . 
definitely , i will . 
and , because it's full scholarship . 
now , it's , uh , not room and board , 
but it's tuition , full tuition paid if your parent works at t c u . 
well , that sounds fantastic . 
and her mother went over there just for that  . . . 
well brent , it's only going to be another year until the youngest is in school . 
and i thought it was a good sacrifice to make ,
i know that when i was in school and getting my degree at the same time he would come home 
and i would leave , 
and then i would come home 
and he would leave , 
and , um , so i think one day one of our kids said , you know , 
someone came home 
it was like that they thought that's the way life was ,
and so i think , um , it's become real important to me that we try to spend time together as a family . 
so there's one or two nights a week , we have a , 
on monday nights we set aside time where it's called , uh , family home evening 
and we stay home that evening , all of us , 
and we do things together . 
you must be a   .
so am i . 
oh , you are ? 
i know what family home evening's all about . 
so you do that 
right , and then we try to do a family activity on saturday ,
and then the family home evening , too . 
and then , you know , sometimes we try to do our lesson on sunday night and then our activity or something on monday 
well , that's good . 
um , how many children do you have ? 
i have two . 
i have a girl and a boy , 
and the boy's five , 
he's in kindergarten , 
and the girl is four . 
she'll be in kindergarten next year . 
i have two daughters . 
my oldest is , uh , four 
and my youngest is about to turn three . 
two girls . 
and they are a handful .
uh , well , when we first got married , my wife worked for a year . 
then we decided to have kids . 
and , uh , she got pregnant 
and then we decided she would stay home with the kids . 
we would make that sacrifice . 
it is a financial sacrifice to make because we go from two incomes down to one . 
and , uh , we made that decision 
and , uh , so after she had the first baby , she stayed home . 
and we had a second baby 
and she's still at home .
and so , uh , you know , at work a lot of people are , you know , 
i think  well  this is not a normal situation anymore in our world we live in . 
most of them , uh , continue to work if they have kids . 
i only have one other person i know in my group here that works where the wife stays home , 
and that's because of religious values as well . 
they're baptists 
and they think that's important . 
but everybody else works 
and they drop their kids off at daycare and leave them 
and , i don't know , i just don't want strangers raising my children . 
well , no , 
and um , it's not as stable for the kids , 
and everybody decided to come over and talk to me right now . 
but , uh , it's , yeah . 
that's how it is at our house when you're on the phone . 
oh , it's open , 
anything goes when mom's on the phone .
 well , it's also important , i think , um , for my husband . 
to plan things that he can do with the kids because ,
so um , you know , it's his job at night . he puts the kids to bed , 
and he reads to them , 
and he spends about an hour doing that , 
and that's pretty good quality time ,
um , but it's hard for him on saturdays . 
he wants , 
with all the yard work and things like that . 
or why don't you 
and if i have something in mind , then he remembers that ,
we feel that , you know , just spending time together . 
you don't necessarily have to be doing anything , you know , that costs money or , you know , that requires you to go a great distance or anything like that . 
it's just the kids like being together as a family . 
like last saturday we went , had some errands to run 
and so we took the kids and , and went by the farmers market down there in garland . 
and they had a blast running around the farmers market looking at all you know , 
and they had a little pen there with animals in they could pet , you know , 
and they liked that . 
and then on the way home we drove by the local high school 
and there happened to be an future farmers of america , f f a 
and they had all kinds of pigs and horses and goats and sheep and everything , you know , all out in this schoolyard there . 
and for them that's wonderful , you know . 
they thought it was the greatest fun , you know , 
and it didn't cost any money . 
and , uh , you don't have quite as much money when the wife doesn't work . 
well , that's right . 
but i do think , um , you know , like the current trends are that , um , the family unit is devaluated . 
it's not 
we find that , you know , back just even fifty years ago when people had financial problems , the first place they went to was their family . 
and families took care of themselves 
they don't 
oh , definitely motherhood is devalued in this society . 
if you're , stay at home and you're a mother , it's like what a waste .
that's right 
and that should be first and , and children second . 
but they don't have what we call an internal perspective of things . 
but that , 
and it's not an easy sacrifice for a person to make ,
and it is hard to make , uh , those interests not be as a major part of my life . 
uh , at this point . 
it's not to say that some day you won't go back to work . 
my mother's a school teacher 
and when we started , uh , having kids , she had to work for a little while , 
but then she just started substituting . 
so she would just substitute once or twice a week , you know , just for that little extra money when we were in school . 
then we would just come home and just you know , go to a neighbor's house for an hour , 
then she'd be home . 
but she wouldn't do that every day . 
but my , uh , youngest sister's at b y u now , 
and so they have no one at home , 
she's back teaching school full time now , again . 
so it's just a temporary thing . 
it is temporary . 
in the middle of it , it seems like a long time , 
but you're right , 
well , i see that we both share the same belief here that 
we're going here , 
and a lot of them decide just not to have children . 
it's amazing , they either have one or none . 
that's true . 
they feel guilty . 
she has this continual guilt trip that she's not doing the right thing , 
and so lots and lots of money . 
basically , i think they really spoil the child ,
she doesn't think she could be a mother at home . 
that's not her bag . 
so she just doesn't think that she could , you know , 
the guilt feelings , she can't deal 
well , it is ,
you know , 
my wife , uh , likes staying home . 
uh , she works at home some , though . 
the place she worked with before , um , worked out an arrangement with her where she can work at home ,
well , that's good . 
and so , uh , it's kind of a seasonal thing . 
three times a year she's really busy doing certain things 
but the rest of the time she's free . 
she likes to sew and do crafts and things like that .
so she enjoys staying at home , 
but , uh , the money part of it is not as rewarding , obviously , 
i think so . 
i think it's an investment in your future , even if it's purely not religious . 
you can at least say that it's important to our country ,
and you really have to make , uh , quite a bit of money . 
the  wife doesn't  make it worth it , with the cost of daycare . 
i know there's , you know , 
when you adjust your income for what you put out for daycare , you know , you're only making like five . 
um , well , i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation . 
i think your generation is , um , 
what do i say , uh , 
uh , they're polite , 
they have more respect for ,
and , um , would be more conservative , some of them i guess . 
we are , uh , somewhat conservative , 
but uh , socially , our crime rate has increased , 
and although it's more publicized as opposed to what it used to be it seems like 
and , um , our prison population has significantly increased i would say . 
um , our economy , too , it's just not what it used to be in the sixties or even fifties from history from what i've read , 
well , it started spiraling down , i suppose , in the seventies , 
and , uh , our recovery , uh , economically has not been like it used to be . 
to me , also , our nuclear family is not the same because more people are living together 
 uh , i don't know if , uh , 
can't make any judgments of that nature , 
but , uh , i don't really want to either  ,
 and , um , kids are , i suppose have been raised by single parents more than they ever used to 
yes , i agree with , 
women are more on the rise too 
and , uh , they don't 
i mean , uh , i've heard different , you know , like , um , like 
i know my mom and like other ladies , they complain because they think that , um , the women now are too busy with their own personal life and career that they really don't have time for their kids . 
that's probably true , 
i mean , they are , a lot of them that have to put their kids into day care 
and , especially if they don't have boy friends or husbands , 
and , uh , i guess that's why you always hear these stories about kids being neglected . 
uh , in fact , uh , there was one lady in this area , 
she was caught going to work and leaving her daughter in her car all day . 
oh my gosh , just a baby . 
not a baby , she was old enough to , uh , 
i would say she was five to eight years old 
oh my gosh . 
but that's just an extreme example . 
i would imagine , you know , the situations are out there . 
well , um , um , well , i think like our education has , um , increased dramatically , 
but then i think also that we're forgetting like basic things , like we should know 
i agree there . 
 like um , values of like per se your generation . 
but i think as we get older , it gets to your , you know what i mean . 
i think the kids now are , i would say , louder now until after they reach like twentyfive , 
and then i think they really have a strong decline and start to settle down and realize things . 
um , i could agree with that , because used to conservatism was inherent at a much younger age , 
because i think we're given more now , whereas you had to work for everything , 
and kids nowadays are just given so much that they really don't have to work , 
they don't have any intent to go working until they have to . 
that's an agreeable topic there .
um , what else considering beside family , economics , um , 
our transportation system has changed for us . 
i mean , we can now travel around the world in no time . 
it's just a hop , skip and a jump to get into a plane to go from the east to the west coast 
 and , uh , well , i think what's happened , too , is just our technology is just advancing so rapidly that , and there's so much information available out there that folks out there just have a hard time keeping up , aside from just going through their daily routine of living to get from day to day 
 and to keep abreast of the knowledge out there , we got to constantly read , go to school , uh , 
t v watching hasn't gone too much out the door because t v is still , well , 
the cable system and the satellite dishes has made it to where a lot of people can just leave regular t v programming and watch a variety of programs out there , as well as use of the v c r 
i don't know , because while i'm up here at school , i don't watch hardly any t v . 
like thursday night i like to sit down and watch a few shows , 
but i , 
do you watch l a law ? 
i used to , 
but i don't any more . 
i like that . 
but , all , 
even though there's a few up here , we call them couch potatoes , 
they love to sit in front of the t v , 
but for the most part , i will , 
well , i live in an all girls dorm , 
but for the most part we're all between the ages of eighteen and like twentyone 
 and there isn't really a lot of t v watching . 
well , that's good , 
i don't know what , 
but , oh , well , i guess , they have their crowds , like during the soap operas , you know , like in between classes or something 
 but i can't say that there's really that many people that like sit in front of the t v all day . 
well , that's a change then , 
oh , of course , going to school , too , it's different from the home environment , 
but , then , um , like i know this girl . 
she's doing her student teaching 
or she's just working like within the school , 
and , um , yesterday she was at the kindergarten , 
and there's this little boy , 
he like didn't want to do anything , 
i don't like it , 
and he sat at his desk with two pencils in his hand , and pretend like he's playing nintendo 
so , uh , i don't know how , 
i mean , i never really watched a lot of t v when i was younger , 
but my parents really didn't allow us to watch that much t v , 
so i don't know . 
i agree with your parents ,
because that's all that we had 
 well , not really , 
but , i mean , it's , uh , for the top medium of entertainment . 
well , i guess we watched a lot of t v in the winter time , 
but in the summer , like right now , my mom , well , like she doesn't let us watch t v until like eight o'clock at night , you know , 
even at your age ? 
like when it starts 
even now when i go home for the summer , she makes us go outside , 
and we're allowed to come in and watch t v until it's dark , because she doesn't like the t v herself 
i see . 
 and if it was up to her , we wouldn't have one . 
so , you know , she feels that kids are too dependent on it also . 
oh . is there anything else ? 
what about in our work ethics ? 
work ethics , oh , .
  it's maybe getting better . um , a little , 
of course , we're having to weather through the savings and loans 
 and , uh , i i think it's going to have to have it's patchwork put on us 
it's going to be really passed on to your generation and maybe a few others 
 well , i really can't think of anything else . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
and , uh , what are majoring in ? 
hi , this is judy , 
i'm from maryland 
and i'm in california visiting right now . 
hi , judy . 
this is norma , 
and i live in virginia .
oh , okay . 
 i know . 
okay . 
well , um , so  , 
let you start  , 
what changes , uh , 
i guess the biggest , 
i don't know your age judy , 
but , uh , in my lifetime the biggest is in more women working ,
well , actually , 
and , um , you know , just to jump ahead a little bit 
but then we can back up . 
is it , perhaps , woman in politics is for the future . 
because i don't see that really yet in positions of power , really . 
i don't see them in positions of power in corporation either 
not many . 
that's true . 
i did work in government . 
and before that i worked in a bank for eight years . 
uhhuh . 
and now i'm retired . 
oh , you , 
 that's the best status . 
that's right . 
yes , um , 
i see , um , 
which do you work in , excuse me ? 
a government . 
a government . 
and i work in academia before . 
and , um , actually there's one , um , woman in our , i don't know what you'd call it , uh , institute who is a manager 
and , i mean , in a since , perhaps , um , she gets protected a lot because it's almost like a token . 
and it's sort of unfortunate because , i think that they don't accept her technically 
but she's a good paper pusher . 
and it's in a technical position really . 
and you know she should be more technical for what she does . 
and i think that's sort of unfortunate ,
but , um , you know , i don't know . 
and teaching i still see that that's where most of the woman are . 
in teaching . 
you know , and it's always been that way . 
but not at the college level . 
not , well , 
we live in a college town 
and i worked at the university for a while . 
and there are woman there 
but they're not the high paid 
not department ,
not the deans and things like that . 
well , they did have one woman dean 
she probably did very well 
but that's the minority . 
uhhuh . 
i think they are extremely well qualified . 
uh , i don't know how , 
they're just not selected somehow . 
i think they're not selected , 
and , of course , at this university , uh , 
it's a big engineering school 
and i don't think there are many women in the engineering college . 
and that's where the high pay is . 
oh , okay . 
but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering . 
but , you know , i say that 
but yet i know too . 
quite an , 
well , i think there are more than there used to be . 
i'm sure there are , yeah . 
but they may not go into teaching , 
i mean , the two that i know obviously are not in teaching 
i don't know why . 
but i don't know that many men that have majored in engineering ,
i mean because i'm in the humanities it's just , 
 oh , uhhuh .
 you know , it's not , 
but , um , yeah , 
it's a , 
well , i met one one day that , uh , had just joined the faculty in agricultural engineering 
and that really surprised me . 
oh , that's interesting , 
i mean , there probably are a limited number of women who are interested in the subject and well qualified . 
and maybe there aren't , you know , .
maybe they don't apply for the job . 
i don't know . 
i don't know how many go on and get a p h d in engineering . 
which could be , you know , partially cultural anyway . 
that could be . 
that's true . 
so that it might be circularly being the same problem of expecting not to get hired for the good jobs anyway , 
 so why spend your time getting qualified . 
that's right . 
it's a rough  , 
um , and i guess amazes me is the number of men who are willing to stay home with the kids 
and , in our case we actually have one father who works parttime , a six ,
that's interesting , 
uh , was she the major wage earner , 
this is , uh , 
 i mean , did she earn more money that he did 
well , see , 
but , yeah , 
because you know , he's a really nice guy 
but he did say that because he was in the humanities and he's now working in more of a technical situation that he had trouble finding a job . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so that you know , maybe she was more qualified . 
but still it's interesting that , you know , he , 
uh , but it's unusual . 
uh , i know one , uh , gal 
she's a c p a , 
and her husband is a house husband . 
and then they had a child 
and he was still the house husband . 
he wasn't ,
 oh , he was , 
oh , now that really is .
she was a little perturbed about it . 
oh , she was . 
she's moved away . i don't know how it is now 
but i know , uh , we all went out one evening 
there was an underlying note she was perturbed about it . 
i mean i think it would strike one as strange if there's no reason for 
i don't think there was a valid reason .
that's true . 
you're a house husband 
that's what you'll always be . 
but yet , you know we have to think about that 
because if she had offered to stay home we wouldn't have thought anything stran , 
she wouldn't have be , 
that's right . 
 so , so we're , 
it wouldn't have been a  doubter  .
that's true . 
oh , gee . 
i guess we can't win .
because if somebody does if and breaks tradition you're surprised . 
but if .
that's right .
oh , dear . 
so , so , 
i think maybe more men would like to be if they 
if they could get away with it .
 oh , dear . 
you know , well , uh , i mean it's an interesting topic 
yet i must say it's not one that i've given a great deal of , 
but , uh , 
i didn't . 
it's , um , one of those things that , you know , seems to happen . 
how do you feel your career has gone ? 
i don't feel for the most part that i've been discriminated against . 
you don't . 
that's good . 
but i don't like administration . 
so then i'm , uh , uh , probably a poor example , although , you know , i was an administrator and could still be i suppose . 
i was discriminated against very definitely in banking . 
it was terrible . 
oh , really . 
you were more ambitious than they would let you be ? 
and the money didn't go with the positions . 
well , i would , 
the promotions came 
but there comparable pay for the responsibility . 
oh , jeez . 
actually in a since i suppose , when i was hired into the government , um , i was taken advantage of 
get higher increments ,
i thi , 
i think we , uh , are programmed to just take it 
that's probably true . 
i hadn't thought about it because i do like what i do 
so uh , nobody must like it . 
it must be a rotten job for everybody .
but i know some people thrive on it .
oh , gee . 
well , since i don't have a whole lot more to say on the topic . 
i don't , 
i guess , nothing is as awful as abortion 
but like gun control and , uh , day care an things like that , 
and there are some very different views , uh , of the people connected with the program which i thought was really interesting , you know . 
well , now you say two different parts of the country 
are you referring to yourself 
maryland a hub of liberalism  ,
you know , in many ways , uh , very liberal 
very somewhat to new england 
though pennsylvania and new york , uh , aren't actually as liberal , 
maryland is a very liberal , uh , state 
so , so , here we have , um , we have gun control laws 
we probably have some of the strictest gun control laws in the nation 
and most people in maryland vote for that , you know . 
so , it really is a different , um , 
uh , well , of course , you talk gun controls down here in texas 
and you're asking to be lynched . 
that's right talk to , 
i had to talk about gun control with somebody 
and i talked with a woman who actually , you know , had just purchased a gun that day ,
and it was very different 
it was a whole ,
um , this has opened my eyes to thinking , you know , 
because i'd really never met people that did , 
and now , i talk to people that do . 
so it's really interesting . 
well , it's very true , 
now i'm a , uh , new yorker by birth . 
although i claim florida as my home now , uh , 
i have two sons living down there 
but i also have two sons living elsewhere ,
but i lived in florida for ten years 
and i kind of like it down there , 
but they had a gun control law which went a little bit too far . 
i think uh , 
isn't it funny . 
i mean if i'm correct i believe they permitted their carrying concealed weapons . 
i think in the next session they uh modified it 
but it's still legal to own or possess weapons in uh uh florida . 
well you can possess 'em here too 
but they're registered 
and uh , like 
you have the seven day waiting period . 
uh huh . 
i'm with the n r a myself . 
and uh , uh really the only objection we have is uh you give a little 
and next thing you know   somebody's trying to take more . 
that's true 
and that's the
the same i know the abortion issue with right to life and right to choose 
and both of them
there's there's always that difficulty 
do you consider yourself a liberal ? 
well let
what is your feeling about uh uh expressing yourself by burning the american flag ? 
well i'll tell you . 
if they didn't give as much coverage to these idiots that burn the flag , it would never happen 
do you know what i mean ? 
it's only because they make a big stink over it . 
but i guess actually i believe that if somebody wants to burn the flag i guess that's their opportunity 
they're right in the sense of freedom of speech 
but i would never 
well now wait a minute there 
you just said it . 
what does speech have to do with
well it's free 
that they 
i think the idea of freedom of speech goes back to 
and the whole aspect
america stands on is that they can do that uh , 
though i would never even consider
i think uh you
but i still 
what the flag stands for i guess to me is
now uh well i still
but i
i guess you feel differently . 
then would you condone the burning of the capitol building ? 
if somebody
but of uh public
uh , then you don't draw a line between public property and uh uh uh a public uh symbol . 
i don't know 
i guess the symbolism 
oh i think what america stands for is the right to be able to disagree with the government . 
uh yeah 
uh i
you can disagree
i guess
 and um i believe that the idea of burning
my understanding of how it was framed is that the thing about this country is that you can disagree with its government 
and you can display
uh , yeah , 
i g 
and so that as a freedom of expression and speech and
um as long as it's your flag your point . i think . 
because , realistically , like you don't think it's right 
and i would never do it . 
i love this country too much , 
and that symbol means a lot to me . 
um . but 
well here again we uh 
even though you agree with me
nevertheless you maintain that of any citizen
uh huh . 
uh , um so long as it's their possession . 
uh huh . 
and i used to know as a boy scout 
but all i remember was the red in the flag represented the blood that was shed to to create this country ,
and , to me that's uh uh black eye to every man that ever uh carried a weapon or killed for his country . 
i agree there too . 
i find it you know personally disgusting 
the same i don't know 
i guess i get uh all
it g when uh it's an emotional issue , 
and you sit 
and you try and think
uh but logically um 
even you know for instance , the pro life pro choice movement , uh you know 
i don't know anybody that actually supports abortion , 
but they
because you know that's just a disgusting thing you know 
an abortion means it's somebody's in trouble and that it's an awful thing ,
see , mo 
but realistically when you think of it it just sounds like such an awful thing , 
and it evokes an emotional response . 
i think that's the hardest thing , 
i don't know if i could ever be a judge , because
i think the um 
sometimes i guess 
what did i read recently 
the uh christian uh point
but then um a friend of mine's a doctor and argues with others that conception is a biblical term . 
and there's no concept of conception in medicine or biology . 
 so that throws out that idea makes it a religious discussion then . 
so it's 
it's a topsyturvy world 
and it's really something how um political
within the own uh society ,
how it'll sway from one extreme to another . 
 uh i think that uh you know i just read something i think in time magazine uh about um protest 
um , i think that in this day and age everyone needs to have some sort of exposure to community service 
because it seems like 
and of people that are in jail now , 
i think that maybe if some of those people had gotten exposed to the community , gotten exposed to working with other people that some of the things that they did they would not have done 
because they understand people more , 
they understand helping people more , 
they understand the plight of people . 
that's true . 
uhhuh . 
i agree with you in the sense that , uh , i think that it's important for people to , uh , also share , give something of themselves 
 and , uh , i think that there's too much in a way of selfgratification today , 
and there's not enough sharing . 
i would think that for , like people that are just filthy , filthy rich , 
i think that they would benefit also in doing community service so that they can see 
and i'm speaking about people that are like born rich , 
and that's all they know , 
and i'm thinking that community service would help them , uh , just get a feel of what else is out there , how other people are living , you know , 
if they were to work i don't know , a soup kitchen or something ,
and i think the peace corps is great too ,
and you see , 
uh , in fact i saw an interview on t v the other night with , uh , patrick swayze , 
and he's making a movie in , i think it's , uh , calcutta or either india ,
and he said that people in the west , 
he said since being there and i guess he's been there about six months , 
he said that his whole idea of what's important has changed , 
and he said that people have no idea , he said , of what human sacrifice is , you know , 
since being there what it is to be poor and have nothing 
and yet those people have , uh , such , uh , a happy ,
on what they don't have . 
they dwell on what they do have 
and they're happy with each other type of thing . 
that's great . 
completely changed his life . 
and i think that that , you know , 
this , on the same note being 
he was exposed to that 
and maybe he wasn't before , 
and now he sees , 
and i think that anybody that works in some kind of service or for the community or something ,
you can't know what you don't see ,
exactly right . 
and you have to experience some things . 
you know a lot of people know that other people are poor 
but you , 
uhhuh . 
well that must be true especially if you do something along the lines of , uh , you know , helping them learn how to survive , how to plant ,
and i've seen so many ,
it's like one person can make a difference , 
and i really believe that they can in something like that . 
there's something i've really be skeptical of , you know , 
you watch television 
you'll see the service announcement for children in other countries 
and you can help a child . 
i don't know , i guess it's just me 
but i don't know whether to trust that or not , 
i mean there are so many scams ,
i know 
and how do yo , 
i would love to help somebody , you know , 
but i can't bring myself to trust this , 
i don't know , just today people are just so money hungry ,
i know . 
it's true , 
it really is . 
 and so you don't know what they , 
it's the sad life i think today . 
in the years of my growing up . 
i mean i'm fiftythree years old , 
and i have seen a town change from a town to a city and its ,
and you would think that more people would be better , you know share more ,
but if they just get more , uh , unto themselves kind of , 
more selfcentered , uhhuh . 
and it's not the sharing of ,
 and we would go out and not even lock our doors 
but you can't do that today . 
but today , i mean , you know , it's like you wouldn't even think of doing that . 
if you don't have bars on the window you're not even safe you know ? 
even when i first moved to dallas from new york , it seemed like dallas was so open , you know , 
everybody left their ,
you just run ,
you leave your car running ,
and this was only , uh , 
well i guess it has been awhile , 
it's been almost ten years since i moved here . 
and it's amazing now how much it's changed . 
i mean i don't go , 
in dallas i , 
i was going to say 
cause in fact i was talking to someone from dallas , uh , just last week 
and they was saying that , uh , 
in fact it was this one girl particularly that worked for t i , 
and she had gone overseas to tokyo , 
and she asked them there if there was anywhere that she shouldn't go because she was alone ,
and she said they thought for a few seconds 
there's nowhere that you can go that you would have to be afraid . 
they said to her that even if she left her purse on the subway okay , 
this is a foreign country 
 and you would think , you know , uh , being , uh , an american or whatever ,
oh god , 
that would be the exact opposite of here . 
i mean if you leave something anywhere you might as well forget it . 
 and she said she could tell them for fifteen minutes places not to go in , 
and that's where she was from . 
that is sad . 
she said even choosing her apartment she had to be so careful because of being a woman alone , 
you know she had , 
there are certain . 
i live in a one bedroom , 
i'm single , 
and i could live in an apartment , 
i live in waco , okay , 
oh yeah . 
and you either live in really low priced housing or you live on the other side of town in the high price apartments . 
and i live , 
i don't make a lot of money 
but i live in the high price apartments simply because i feel safe here 
 and i'm paying probably the hundred or hundred fifty dollars more than i would be paying somewhere else 
but i wouldn't be able to sleep at night 
and that to me is worth the extra money 
i feel very safe where i am , you know , 
instead of , 
and that's why i think if people were more exposed to , uh , 
especially , uh , young kids getting out of high school . 
i mean at one time they would go into the service ,
it was like they said , 
join the navy to see the world type of thing , you know , 
but nowadays , they don't do that anymore . 
it's not a thing a , 
a lot of young men don't even , uh , have the desire to go into the service . 
they don't even consider it . 
and i don't know 
i attributed i think , a lot of that to women working .
i was talking to someone yesterday about that . 
the bonding process , 
and we were saying that is disrupted these days , 
it very definitely is . 
and so , i think , you know , before the father would work 
and the mother , you know , would stay home 
and having that mother there , that base , i think ,
that's right . 
and the thing is , 
like i think a man can afford to support a woman , 
but the woman affords the luxuries . 
in other words like anyone can live ,
you have to ,
it's what's important to you . 
now a family , 
i think that like girls today , have children , 
and six weeks later they're back to work . 
they don't even have a bonding with that child , 
it's the most beautiful thing that happens between a mother and a child .
so much , 
when i call , 
and i mean once the child's in school if you had a job from say nine to three ,
i mean they're in school , 
you're at work . 
that's great . 
but it's kids that come home and don't have a mother there 
that's what this was 
well , basically i like comedy shows .
yeah 
what do you like ? 
i mean we have two t v s 
but neither one of them work , 
 oh , okay . 
 so for the last year , 
i mean we just got married 
and we decided well , for the first year we won't get a t v 
so i mean i'm totally out of it as far ,
that's okay 
we'll been married eleven years 
and , um , we went through that after about five years of marriage , 
my old t v that i had from college when we got married finally went out 
and we made it almost about eighteen months without a television . 
and then you get to remote control the stereo phonic ,
v c r , and everything else . 
 oh , yeah , 
and then you never use the v c r , 
and now we have two of them 
and now it's like we're just glad we never went out and bought a compact disk player cause we wouldn't use it .
you're working , 
you're at school . 
well , i don't know t v shows , 
what can i tell you , um , 
basically junk that's on television .
that's my opinion 
um , i like things like i just mentioned , 
have you ever seen murphy brown , or anything like that ? 
you don't think so , 
oh , that's the one with candice bergen in it , um , 
well , see another thing was i worked on second shift for like a year and a half , 
that would do it . 
and then before that i was in college for four years 
and i never watched t v then because i didn't have time . 
nobody does yeah , then , 
i know . 
i mean i did watch t v 
it was soaps and m t v cause the girls i lived with never changed the channels   .
and the , uh , 
well i don't , 
you're probably at least ten years younger then i am 
but i could tell you in school that , uh , the only thing that ever saw in the dorm was , uh , the one soap opera , all my children . 
and until then i never paid attention to soap operas . 
me too . 
and to this day twenty years later i'm in my thirties , 
i'm not that old , 
i know , 
i mean i almost got hooked on it cause everybody would took about it at dinner and everything else 
you know , it was like . 
they , you know , 
about the only other kinds of things i like , um , 
i like to watch a lot of news , um , 
don't you miss that with not having a television so far ? 
how long has it been since you've had one ? 
well , almost a year . 
oh my god .
yeah , 
you've got about another six months 
and then you'll get one .
by then , 
but i thought , you know , my husband would really like miss it because he was an only child 
and he's seen a lot of t v . 
it will never last 
my husband is an only child too 
and he did miss it 
that's kind of why we got back after eighteen months , 
 that's funny . 
 and i'm trying to think about the only other show i watch . 
i've seen cheers probably five times 
and i've seen cosby show probably ten times . 
i like cosby , 
l a law is probably , 
i've seen cheers 
more then that i hate to admit 
but , uh , 
it's pretty cool 
i like that whenever i watch it . 
i thought it was good , 
i've actually been to that bar in boston 
you know , it's a pretty funny show . 
oh , you have ? 
yeah , 
i've heard it's pretty cool . 
it's just a , you know , over priced downtown ,
i'm trying to think what else is on television , 
i know it's like . 
 i watched a lot of t v when the war was on . 
who didn't ? 
isn't that sad ? 
and then , uh , i like watching a lot of like college basketball and , 
i mean that sounds kind of stupid 
 oh no , 
  i watch pro football 
but i like the n b a playoffs ,
and now , 
where are you calling from ? 
uh , sherman , texas . 
sherman , texas , oh , 
where are you from ? 
i'm in dallas 
i was just saying where am i calling you from , you know , 
they haven't been that good this year . 
let's see  , 
you don't have a t v . 
so , are you really from texas though ? 
well , sounds like you're from up north . 
my voice you mean ? 
oh , no , 
that's just because i've moved around 
and , uh , 
i was going to say . 
cause i wondered you know , if had any teams you like watching from up north or something . 
real big 
and , uh , um , i always watch them no matter who's on , 
do you ? 
well , i'm from indiana . 
oh , okay . 
so i like the bears . 
there you go , 
and then  , 
i like , 
i watch , uh , huh . 
so i mean i haven't played in years 
but , um , i just like to watch , you know , 
it gets boring after a while 
but i don't , 
go ahead . 
i used to watch oprah a lot in the afternoons ,
and i see her every once in awhile like if i go workout at t i , 
 you know , they have those t v s right ,
is sh , 
i don't know 
she's not as good as she use to be 
maybe cause she got chubby again or something , 
 her disposition's gone downhill . 
was her show big when you where in school since you haven't been out that long ? 
 oh , yeah . 
it's pretty cool , 
was it ? 
 i mean back then 
and did you see the show where she lost all of that fat ? 
she wheeled it out on a  cart  .
i saw tapes of her  , 
that was so cool , 
and then man she's really porked out again i guess 
gee , i know 
isn't that terrible . 
i know 
i guess with that money who cares .
i'd eat too . 
let's see what else is on television . 
oh , if you don't have a v c r we just got one after nine years don't even spend your money on it . 
and then , you know , you see it when it first comes out if you really want to see it 
and then it usually comes on television within two years .
we got , 
so we usually see like firstrate movies ,
really , that's television 
i don't know 
so i mean , 
i'm sorry . 
that's okay , 
  i mean , i always   .
it's like me talking about taxes or something , 
i feel bad cause i mean , 
 oh , that's okay . 
i had one lady one time 
and she was from boston , 
and she was very snooty 
and , uh , her kids were going to places like amherst and b u 
and i said i didn't know what that was 
so i know , 
 i mean it's like don't worry about it 
you know , everybody's ,
uh , what was his name wolf blitzer ? 
what was that ? 
that guy that was a reporter for c n n . 
his name is wolf blitzer . 
did you see him when he was doing the coverage of the gulf ? 
um , i might of . 
i forget . 
was he the guy that got captured ? 
uh , no , 
i can't remember his name . 
but what about this wolf guy ? 
 but just th   , 
they made jokes about him like on the carson show and all of that , 
jay leno . 
you know , what my absolutely favorite show is ? 
david letterman . 
i love that guy . 
he's funny . 
and saturday night live , 
i use to watch that 
like i'd come home from second shift and watch him like for an hour and a half , 
he's great . 
saturday night live has changed a lot if you haven't seen it in about a year . 
i mean i haven't seen it in a couple of months 
has it gotten better ? 
 uh , yeah , 
i mean they finally like   
and some of those people 
they really have funny characters on there . 
they just call it pat 
and you don't know if it's a man or a woman .
 and they say well , they're trying to deduce what he or she is , 
i carry a fanny pack .
so you still don't know because a fanny pack is man , 
or now days , you know . 
yeah 
it's weird .
 that's funny . 
yeah it is pretty funny 
i mean they do some crazy things . 
like when wayne's world , 
i love that . 
and what's that other one where they do the , um , skits , 
well , you've must have seen it recently ? 
well , i don't know , 
i've seen it off and on , i think . 
you probably have some friends that have television  ? 
because i've seen it off and on probably . 
you know , i mean you're not totally out of the loop . 
i mean , yeah . 
we , you know , 
one friend of ours got rid of his because we , you know , cause we were getting along out ours 
so he sold his . 
but the rest of our friends we go and watch them . 
i mean you can do without one 
but after awhile it will start , um , you know , 
i mean you just kind of all of sudden 
you hear about something that somebody else talked about , 
 and you just end up doing it 
but if you haven't been married that long , you know , 
 is that on tape ? 
is that on tape , 
there you go , 
that's funny . 
oh , my 
what else is on 
i don't know 
what did they watch in college when you where in , 
where did you go to school ? 
oh , purdue . 
oh , that's a good school . 
yeah , 
i know about that . 
they don't have a southern accent up there though . 
you must be native texan ? 
do i , 
are you serious ? 
i've been here three years . 
deep one , you have a deep one , 
oh , wow , 
that's scary . 
it is , um , 
at purdue 
i went to high school in chicago , i'm trying to think what purdue kids watch . 
we watch , uh , m t v twenty four hours a day 
and then every now and then they taped days , you know , 
that's the girls i lived with 
and , you know , other then that i'm sure they watched , 
i think other then accept on a commercial or on news coverage or something ,
you aren't missing anything .
that's kind of what i've heard .
it's pretty bad . 
i mean that's , 
especially if you have kids . 
don't let them watch it . 
we don't 
and i mean i don't even have cable 
i don't think it's worth ten to thirty bucks a month to pay ,
i mean my neighbor her husband sits in front of the television all of time 
and they've only been married five years have a cute one year old kids 
i swear to god he works from eight , 
well , i heard dallas is pretty bad with the crime . 
well , you know , you know last night i was listening to the , uh , ten o'clock news . 
and for the first five to seven minutes of a news broadcast all they were talking about was the number of shootings , the number of drug deals that were going on , and crime 
and it's so depressing just to even listen to the news anymore . 
the same way here in dennison . 
i mean , uh , back a couple weeks ago they found , uh , some people i don't remember at some fast food restaurant . 
i can't remember if they had been shot or if they had just been thrown in the freezer 
but i'm pretty sure they'd been shot and put the freezer at the fast ,
and i've worked in fast food restaurants . 
they don't have that much money on hand , 
they really don't . 
i did too . 
i remember i used to work at , uh , kentucky fried chicken . 
and i just couldn't believe , um , you know , that 
now i would hate to work at a fast food restaurant or even have my children work in one . 
and , uh , because of , uh , the crime 
that they would , um , kill people just for the few couple hundred dollars that they would have in there ,
my husband worked at a gas station when he was a teenager . 
and well i don't know , he decided not to work one night or something 
and one of the guys that was working was shot , 
and , kenny quit the next day . 
he couldn't deal with it . 
oh , i understand what your talking about . 
so , yeah , 
i have , uh , uh , you know , a real problem , uh , 
even though i live further out in the suburbs ,
if you live in a small town or if you live in a large city like this . 
um , all the different ways that we have to protect ourselves from , 
it just seems like a lot of people are attracted to the bigger cities though , 
the worst part of it . 
um , i lived in louisville , kentucky for a while , 
but , i lived on the outskirts too , 
but louisville was pretty bad especially during like the , uh , kentucky derby . 
at this time of the year it's horrible to live in louisville . 
but , uh . 
so , i don't know , um , you know , 
i know i have , uh , um , home security system . 
plus , i have on the outside . 
and i have , 
the ones that blink off and on . 
that , uh , 
by themselves i mean . 
if there's some kind of movement ,
but , i mean it's just i'm constantly think about keeping us safe and protected ,
how many kids do you have ? 
a boy or ? 
one of each . 
oh , that's what i've got , 
it is scary , 
are they babies or , 
oh , well good .  that  they're a comfort to you . 
i've still got babies . 
i've got a four year old . he'll be four . and a three month old . 
oh , wow . 
and it's scary  ,
that's a problem . 
i'm used to living in , uh , 
we don't live in the city , 
but we just . 
it's still more crowded than what i'm used to , 
i'm used to having , you know , eight or ten houses on one street 
and this one's got houses on either side and , you know , 
and just , 
it's different , 
living down here . 
now the nice thing , uh , 
i feel a little bit more comfort since we're so close together like this . um , 
i feel like that there's going to be , uh , less crime 
or your neighbors going to be watching out for you , um , 
oh , oh well , 
we think our neighbors are stealing from us , actually my husband . 
one of them's a teenager that lives next door 
and her friends are pretty wild . 
they've stolen gas out of our vehicles . 
oh goodness . 
and so he went and got a locking gas cap for his . 
they weren't stealing it out of mine so much , because the gas thing is kind of weird where it's hard to ,
so he went and got a locking cap 
and they tried to break that off . 
oh my goodness . 
and  , excuse me . 
and they stole our tailgate off his truck .
oh goodness . 
well , we can't say they did 
someone did , 
we're pretty , 
yeah . 
it had to be somebody that , you know , could do it in the middle of the night 
and , you know , they'd seen it earlier . 
it doesn't matter where you are anymore . 
it's , uh , more of a matter of the steps that you do to keep yourself safe , 
that's why i try and , uh , do , 
well , the only thing that we can do as citizens is , you know , like , uh , watch groups that they'll have . 
but they can be dangerous too . 
i've thought about it . 
you know , that this isn't like walking around and looking for somebody 
you can get yourself into trouble . 
you know , i was going home the other day 
and i saw , um , a guy who looked like he was breaking into a window , 
and i thought , gee whiz , you know , i don't know if he's really doing that or not or if he's the person who lives there . uh , 
you know , and i was thinking well , i need to call the police when i get back home 
because it was about oh about four or five blocks from where we live 
uh , and i thought no , you know , because i wouldn't know if that was really a robber or not because it was in broad daylight . 
but anymore , you know , the crime happens in daylight ,
well , i watched it on t v , oh , i guess last year sometime . 
they'll break in in the daytime , 
and , i hear that , you know , if you lock yourself out of your house 
and you try to get in your house 
it will 
you give 
that half the time it takes you to break in . 
uh , a professional could break in , in ,
half that time , 
i mean that's so scary . 
it is . 
so scary you think you've got yourself all locked in and safe , 
and , uh , somebody could break in , uh , 
oh i have a dog , 
that's the one thing that i like . 
uh , i want a german shepherd . 
um , i don't want any of those ones that will   up the kids , 
but i do want a german shepherd . 
because my husband will leave every once in a while ,
he works on the railroad . 
and i'm scared here by myself . 
oh yeah . 
so that's ano , uh , 
we have a little dog now 
but he is just as vicious you know , if you , bu , 
and loud . 
but we doesn't need a big dog . 
we got this little bitty dog that , uh , 
part dachshunds and part cocker spaniel . 
and um , ease very protective , 
the cocker spaniels are loud .
well that's , 
very protective , 
that's a deterrent . 
because they know that that dog's going to bark . 
that's right . 
but it's easy to fool a dog too . 
you know , throw them meat or 
 um , a real intense burglar can just get another dog that's in heat . 
from what i've he , 
you know , saw it on t v . 
oh , wow , gosh . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
it was . 
 and maybe we'll meet up again . 
all righty . 
there's one , uh , 
i meant living in texas , 
where you at ? 
i'm in rome , new york . 
rome , new york , 
okay , well , texas , 
they do .
he's reminding me of where i live , 
yeah , 
new york does not 
 but , uh , they're trying to reinstate it 
and the governor's opposed to it being uh , the democrat that he is ,
 but the state legislatures are more and more coming to supporting it . 
uh , i ethically don't like the idea 
or i should say morally i don't like the idea , 
but , uh , socially and ethically i think it's a good idea , in certain crimes . 
even more , 
i don't know if this is cold and too pragmatically 
but i'm really offended ,
any    , 
i know . 
and texas is having a problem right now 
and molestations to murders of children , just , you know , really bad things 
and these people are getting out like three to five years before they're even suppose to be considered , 
 and now , they can't find them 
and they're finding bodies in di , you know , 
i mean , you it's over crowded , 
or is the world really that rotten .
i don't know , 
i know . 
it's a hard question , 
you look at the united states , 
we have the largest murder rate of any developed , uh , 
 and then , 
 or , uh , 
i don't know how  americans are about  handguns 
but , uh , yesterday a lady i work with just told me today that , uh , in the state capitol here in austin , texas , they had been , uh , looking at a bill , uh , making it easier to accept the bill to access handguns 
and they passed it , which basically means without an f b i check any person here in this state over twentyone can get a gun .
here in new york it's a lot harder than that , uh 
is it , 
that's good . 
 uh , it takes almost six months to get , uh , handgun permit , in this state . 
 say , that good , 
i think that's , like the state of virginia , 
that's great . 
now , the , 
and that's with , uh , 
you have to have , uh , oh , a police investigation , 
you have to ,
and i know , because a friend of mine wanted to get one and listed me as a reference 
and i know it , 
it's very easy to get , uh , uh , you know , 
there's no restrictions , whatsoever , on hunting rifles and shotguns and things like that ,
they're no , 
the  cattiness  behind , 
uh , so , 
i mean i don't like guns in general 
but when i think about , uh , this topic like capital punishment i mean , i just remember when i was in college in a dorm 
and i think if he'd been around one of my family members probably would have killed him 
but in florida , in the state of washington when they had the ted bundy case 
 and how they just exe , 
well , it hasn't been just 
but it was in the , i think the second or third quarter of last year , nineteen ninety 
you di , you know , 
this is nothing , 
but i might be too cold too , but they flip a switch , 
i don't know , 
i mean , 
and then 
so many times . 
yeah . 
and did it again 
and , uh , 
i mean , and that's just maybe because of the little more , they said celebrated that , uh , 
he's not the only one ,
you see somebody's mini series 
and you hear about somebody's crime , 
there was something on , 
and this gets back to capital punishment , 
but the man had stolen , uh , not stolen but kidnapped , uh , some wealthy exathlete's daughter somewhere in florida 
and they changed all the facts that they said it was true 
 and they buried her alive 
oh , god . 
 and peter strauss had played the lead role 
you know how they have these mini dramas , at the end they said , this set person was paroled like six months ago 
i mean , you know , i'm not sure that capital punishment serves as a deterrence 
but it does serve as a uh , definite ,
in that particular instance , uh , 
but i know it's on a 
and be all , 
that's the problem i have with it , 
in texas they think it's 
and be all , 
they think that if they electrocute or slip , or do something , or gas somebody , uh , that they're not going to have the crimes that they do have 
and we happen to live in dallas which is extremely crime ,
 and we just moved here , uh , 
we've been here before , lived in minneapolis , saint paul , uh , which has an exceedingly low crime rate , 
and then we were transferred back here , 
and when you're gone from some place for about six years as we were , you really begin to see , uh , just how problematic just living is ,
and how , 
you're in ,
rome , new york , 
it's up state 
is that 
and , is that like near albany or syracuse , 
it's about , uh , 
well , i actually live in a village of sylvan beach , 
i work in rome , uh , 
what type of area is that , 
it's more rural , 
is that in term , 
 but it's kind of , uh , 
all the industry has gone south , 
 and , uh , now the air force is the largest employer in the , uh , area 
uh , uh , 
you know , 
not too bad . 
 but i don't know that there's a real , uh , 
not the harsh criminality , 
now , dallas is a 
i'm being very sarcastic , 
it's just a great ,
on some days , uh , it's , uh , i don't know 
the good ole boy network here is , uh , very strange , like i said 
they believe that , if they kill somebody , you know , tit for tat and ,
but yet they want spend the money to build the new jails that , 
i mean , they really are over ,
 i mean , that's just not a cop out , uh , 
and you know , i'm originally from pennsylvania which i think is basically like new york these days , 
i don't think they have capital punishment there . 
pennsylvania may have just reenacted it 
because i'm uh , 
and i'm from pittsburgh 
uh , because they use to be very , very conservative when i was growing up 
i haven't lived there in twenty ,
 but , uh , 
the west part of the state is 
and then the east part of the state has got all the bleeding hearts and all the welfare cases 
there you go .
i don't know 
that's a different subject , 
 but , uh , i don't know 
i think everybody would feel it is same way if they were touched by crime . 
i think everyone would , 
 you and i think are  honest and candid because we could do it in this ,
if your friends or family uh , had that happen to them i think everyone would , 
i just , 
i mean i just don't , uh , oh , 
i did a paper back in college a long time ago for criminal justice class , 
and i just , 
the subject , 
i remember we drew things out of a hat 
and uh , it was basically the essence was does the crime fit the punishment 
and when you see how many repeat offenders there are , uh , rapist getting their hand ,
and you're thinking , oh , not only would you not want to be a victim 
you wouldn't want to be a criminal either 
 but , i don't know , 
methods of capital punishment i have no opinions on that either 
i just  , 
well , uh , uh , yeah , 
i don't know 
i think the old gas chamber seems to be about the most painless 
because i guess it's a pretty , 
is it , uh , 
how about the injection , 
 oh , yeah , 
an injection , 
is that suppose to be . 
that would be even , 
i'm not even sure , in the split among the fifty states , 
do you know which way it is the ratio , 
it's more than , 
aren't , uh , 
it's more that don't have it , 
isn't that correct . 
but amazingly it's like , uh , massachusetts went back ,
i don't know if they've used it since they've reinstated it 
but , uh , it's on the books . 
 i don't know if they did something about  
i'm not sure if texas , 
they were again , 
well , did they have it , 
they were against it , uh , 
texas , as i said , has it 
but i haven't been back here long enough to realize whether or not , 
well , i guess it depends on what age . 
i am in the thirty something , 
so i know , 
i mean i lived through it . 
uh , are you old enough to know about the war ? 
i am , uh , twentynine . 
so , uh , 
well , yeah , 
you are old enough . 
but it was on the fringe . 
just , uh , yeah , 
had some friends that were in it . 
it ended , uh , when i was in , uh , college . uh , when i turned nineteen in nineteen seventy , 
i cannot even remember at this point . uh , 
when i turned nineteen it was the year that , uh , the draft was still going on . 
if i had been a male or in israel , i would have been number two . 
so i learned a lesson in gender .
uh , in terms of the war , i do not know . uh , 
actually i do not really know that much about it . 
i just know socially the impact it had here and what you hear in the media , you know . uh , 
i guess i think it was , uh , uh , not that great that we were in there , uh , in terms of for how long it lasted . 
you know . 
what do you think ? 
well , i think it is , uh , basically the same way . 
it certainly has affected , uh , u s policy though . 
there is , 
because , uh , the whole thing that was bad about vietnam , it was no different from iraq . 
i mean it was , uh , one country picking on a smaller , weaker one . 
the devastation , 
yeah . 
if we were going to support this smaller country , then we are going to support it a hundred percent . 
and we are going to consider ourselves against , in war ,
and in full 
which , uh , 
which really was not the attitude with vietnam . 
it was sort of a president's war 
it just kind of 
uh , i do not know how you were historically . 
but i was a little bit older before i realized just how long it had been going on since 
 i mean , i pa , 
it really , well , 
in fact , because in terms of when your , 
there is at least ten years between us , 
so in terms of when you were in school , i am sure that it was , you know , the majority of your high school and junior high years . 
uh , one of the things i did not like was systems that they used . 
uh , it just did not seem that , uh , i do not know , technically we knew what we were doing either . 
and then you heard about the things like agent orange , et cetera , 
of course uh , now everyone's more , uh , you know , environmentally 
i mean back then it was not commonly known that saccharin was bad for you and all these other things 
that is true , uh , 
uh , monetarily too , i just do not think we have done enough for the , uh , vietnamese people as a whole . uh , in south vietnam , in general , in helping them restore themselves . 
you know , and i don't know if it is because there are not any oil fields there .
uh , i do not know if they have that resource or not . 
i mean i do not think they do . 
but i just think it is kind of a shame that , uh , you still hear things about the children that are orphans there 
uh , so on a whole , i do not know , war is not good . 
and that one i probably , 
uh , my main opinion would be we should not have done it . 
unless you , 
well , you know uh , a little bit more than i do , 
explain it . 
i did not , uh , get to live through it . 
the people that i know that it did ,
most of , 
i work for a government contractor . 
so uh , oh , at least some of the guys i work with rather are veterans . 
oh , vietnam ? 
and , i have not talked to any of them or rather thought that the reason they went was a good one . 
you know , 
and that , 
they just felt that the way america backed them up was not at all right . 
in terms of the personal . 
the bitterness is more on a personal 
personal level 
and the finances , how they started . you know , 
like air attacks and stuff like that dropped off like crazy . 
because the congress would not approve , you know . 
the money is 
i mean , i think it started actually like , like in the late fifties . i mean like in fiftyeight , fiftynine . 
so it really , 
i mean , because i know , in nineteen sixtythree , i mean i was nine years old ,
so , i mean i remember , uh , right around then that's when i first started hearing about vietnam . 
but then as i got older and studied in school , i realized it was even going on before that . 
that sounds ancient , 
and i know , you know , a lot of the vietnam vets that are my age in their later thirties , uh , guys that i know , that , they are just kind of bitter , you know . 
they , you know , 
i hate to quo , that movie born on the fourth of july , 
but it is that kind of idea . 
you know , they just do not feel that socially they were given , 
like a friend of mine called it the yellow ribbon syndrome . 
they were not given the , 
the ticker tape parade and all that . 
so , well , i won't keep you any more . 
that is probably about as much as we both know .
but thanks for talking to me . 
uh , were you calling from texas ? 
uh , yes , 
is that where you are at ? 
i am in falls church , virginia . 
oh , i know where that is . 
that is beautiful where you are at . 
right near d c . 
d c , 
are you a native of there ? 
uh , pretty much , 
uh , dallas , it is , uh , ninetytwo degrees here today , 
but at least the humidity is , uh , below forty percent , which makes it kind of like phoenix . 
it is about the same weather here . 
little bit cooler , like eightynine . 
well , you , 
but , basically the same thing . 
well you are not missing too much then .
well , take it easy . 
well , i think for me , 
i'm from alabama . 
south alabama , 
and so i grew up in the midst of civil rights movement .
and so i was very much a part of uh  , you know , what was going on there . 
uh , my parents are pretty active 
and , uh , it was very scary 
but now we've seen , you know , uh , black people have a lot more civil rights in that area and i guess all over than they did , you know , twenty years ago . 
oh , definitely . 
there's still a lot  , you know , to be accomplished , 
because i can remember , you know , separate public restrooms and separate water fountains and 
you can relate to that . 
now see , we don't have any of that because , well , like , we live in the country 
and , uh , we really didn't have things like that going on 
so we kind of , uh , 
i guess when i think of social changes , i think more of , uh  , uh , visiting habits of families 
well , that's true . 
that's a good one right there . 
that there's less visiting done , i think , on a whole than there used to be . 
used to be that you took the family whether the kids wanted to go or not , 
you went visiting .
and , uh , today , you know , people , they do visit , 
but it's not quite the same as , uh , what it was , say , twenty years ago , thirty years ago . 
and i grew up out in the country , too , basically , in a rural area 
and so we were always at family in different 
but even now , you know , they don't even do that . 
well , they're so spread out , 
i think has a lot to do with it . 
well , and they're so busy . 
people's personal schedules are so busy . 
a lot of it has to do , i think with more women working 
in our family , you know , twenty years ago , not that many of the women worked . 
that's right , 
and now , uh , almost all the women work . 
the majority , 
and , so that means , you know ,  , a lot of the social visiting and all was , i think , probably instigated by women 
because when you work 
and now , 
that's right . 
and , uh , 
and now , uh , 
i mean my mother does not work 
finds herself pretty alone a lot 
but even just social visits , people don't do that anymore . 
you're right . 
and people don't feel comfortable just to drop in on people 
there's a real , 
you have to make arrangements or have 
you know , you don't want to , 
i guess we don't not to invade people's privacy or whatever . 
well , that could be part of it . 
i don't know for sure what it is . 
i know our children mostly are scattered out at a distance , so we really don't have that even . 
we don't , 
well , out of fifteen grandchildren in my family , only two of us don't live within fifty miles . 
oh , really ? 
and most live within ten 
oh , that's pretty good . 
it's a rural family 
i'm just one of the two 
well , apparently there must be work available , for those 
because around here , there's really nothing for the young people , 
i mean there's jobs . 
there's minimum wage jobs , 
but , uh , to make a good living , there really , around here , there just isn't too much . 
and i guess , you know , that would greatly affect social i . e . , social change . 
probably the job market the economy 
so , well , there's the main things i can think of . 
i really tried to think of some other things 
and i couldn't really , 
well , i think just , also , you know , the women's movement , too , has affected a lot of social change . 
uh , people 
some good 
people marry later . 
i mean basically , i think , 
now , again , where i'm from in alabama that's not necessarily true 
but now out here in texas where i am now , that's very unusual . 
they'd rather get their life started first before , 
most people go to college or at least get a job 
and even , you know , a lot of people seem to be engaged for a long time before they get married 
well , even to get school finished , i think , 
a lot of times it's better if they do finish their schooling before they settle in . 
because a marriage takes a lot of effort and concentration 
and if you're busy with school i think it's really difficult for a family . 
but probably , uh , you know , more women being in the work force also greatly , greatly affects social change . 
because it affects child care 
uh  , 
i know my daughter that lives in pittsburgh , she has two little boys 
and they've been in day care since , you know , 
one's four 
and one's one 
 and they've done well .
now , i wouldn't want to do it that way , 
but , uh , she's quite happy 
and the children seem quite adjusted . 
well , and we just now are seeing the effects of day care on 
that's right , 
they are the first generation that basically grew up with day care . 
that's right , 
and so , you know , it remained to be seen exactly what that does . 
now , i'm going to babysit my granddaughter . 
she's just eight weeks old , 
so this will be new for me .
uh , but the others i'm too far away to help them out at all . 
where do they live ? 
uh , well , i have a son and daughter that live in pittsburgh . one in maryland and one in connecticut . 
a son in connecticut . 
well , they're not too far , though . 
but like connecticut takes eight hours to drive home 
and , uh , it's too far to , you know , really go too often . 
pittsburgh's not quite so bad . 
it's just a couple hours . 
maryland , maybe five hour drive . 
well , i live like fourteen hours from home . 
that's worse yet . 
in fact i'm , 
oh , are you really ? 
to go be there for the fourth of july . 
do you , uh , stay overnight on the way , 
or you , 
it's just me , 
you're young . 
so i can make it . 
how old are you ? 
i'm thirtyfive . 
well you're young enough yet to  , 
although it is pretty , 
i don't know , 
i don't enjoy it that much . 
it's pretty much like get there 
it's work to get there . 
it's just not that pleasant . 
even with other people , i basically just don't like to drive that far . 
now my son , 
they , flew , 
he rebuilt a aranca chief , airplane , 
and they flew down last weekend . 
they came down in it . 
and it still took a long time because it's not a highspeed airplane . 
but they enjoyed in thoroughly . 
i'm not sure , 
wondering how you keep up on the news . 
primarily with our local newspaper and t v . 
i listen to the radio but um , not like i did when i was working . 
i am recently retired 
to that means i have a lot of time to watch the news on t v . 
how do you gain your news ? 
i get the washington post 
 and that is a pretty big newspaper 
and i think that's almost exclusive ly my  first of the  news . 
though i have the radio on when i go to work , i don't think the news usually hits , 
 because i'm not going right on the hour . 
oh , i see . 
you know . 
well , and radio . 
if you're not available on the hour or half hour , then you lose out on an awful lot . 
well , what is your newspaper ? 
that is the washington post 
is that correct ? 
i have read that when we were in that area , 
and it is a splendid newspaper . 
so , what more do we need to discuss  ,
well , i can discuss a lot of the news that we have , 
so thank you for calling . 
oh , okay . 
well , thanks for discussing it . 
all right . 
well , carolyn , knowing about the environment of a nursing home before you would send someone there to live and so forth . 
what do you think would be required , and so forth ? 
uh , i'll tell you , 
that talked about nursing homes , 
and actually they specifically talked about some in the area where i am , here in texas , 
oh , you knew of the homes , then . 
well , i , 
 but , um , they were in the area where i live 
oh , okay . 
and it was really revealing to see some of you know , the things that go on , i guess , in some of these homes , 
so i would definitely , go , 
i guess that the big thing would be once you got someone in a home like that , to make sure that you went daily , you know 
well , from your point of view , that's , you know , means something to you to one of those homes . 
i realize that you indicated you wanted to check out as much as you can about it 
but how do you think they would feel , i should say , about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new home situation ? 
and she's 
oh , okay . 
so i know how she feels about it . 
you know , uh 
i think that would be the , 
well , how do you find that your personal relationship is with her , know that you're both together all the time and you are having to do a lot more for her than normal ? 
does that cause any problems between the two of you ? 
is she , 
i think it's very hard for her , um , to be waited upon , so to speak , 
i mean , i think it's hard for her to have that role of not being able to do as much as she used to . 
it's hard to accept the fact that you're unable to pursue life , at the level that you did before , 
isn't it ? 
i think that's very true . 
um , on the other hand , it takes on almost a switch of a mother child relationship . 
it is different . 
i had that almost similar situation . 
my mother lives in an apartment with my sister 
 uh , so i , except for the three or four months this summer , 
that's the only time i ever spent with my mother , 
and , of course , since i see her only once or twice a year , i was just thrilled 
and i spent every minute i could to be with her and , uh , cooking foods for her , you know , just to make her life as though she were on vacation . 
but somehow another , that doesn't work between my mom and my sister , 
and they are , 
in speaking they , 
i don't know , 
my mother feels uncomfortable around my sister , 
and my sister's uncomfortable because her mother's there 
 and i guess it's just because they're there all the time . 
so has put pressure on both of them from that point of view . 
so that's kind of bad news . 
and by the same token , my wife's mother is now moved into a nursing home , 
and after all she has been a farmer's wife for sixty years 
 and now all of a sudden she's had to move off of her farm , into another home where the environment is totally different . 
she's relatively happy , 
but she doesn't like the food . 
and when she complains about the food 
so , that's another one of those things you have to solve . 
well , that's got to be a big adjustment for someone that's , as you say , lived on a farm for sixty years , 
and then go to something like that . 
after all , their life is so totally different 
because in those early days , the food , they had to make it from scratch , so to speak . 
i mean , you raised your own chickens , 
and you killed your own hogs , i suppose , 
and then they 
i don't want to say barns , 
but they had regular little places they would hang it , you know 
and now , all of a sudden , it , uh , comes in differently , 
it tastes differently . 
that's right . 
do you have any , uh , major preferences as far as television ? 
t v , uh , 
trying to think . 
i like friday , 
what is it , 
is it friday or saturday night shows .
i think it's friday night . 
uh , the one with the two little girls in it , what's it called . 
uh , oh , 
or three little girls . 
the youngest girl . 
oh , yeah . 
i really like that . 
what's it called ? 
uh , i don't know , 
all i can think of is the name of all in the family 
but that's not it . 
full house . 
there you go . 
yeah , 
i really like that show . 
that is good . 
i like , uh , 
we have cable . 
i really like watching the old nick at nite shows , you know . 
and , uh , we can watch those all night sometimes if , 
oh , really ? 
uh , lately i've been getting into talk shows 
and  , 
oh , yeah ? 
just really whatever . 
just as long , 
it depends on the subject actually . 
where it's more interesting . 
some of them get pretty boring 
uh , there's that guy , 
i think it's out of dallas , 
his name is , uh , oh , 
i wish i could remember his name . 
is he one of the talk show guys ? 
maury povich ? 
and has a bald head 
and his first name starts with an m . 
huh , let's see . 
oh , it's like , 
his first name's like marlo or marlin , 
i can't remember his name . 
anyway , he always has like really strange shows like , uh , just 
see , i don't like those , 
i like 
i don't either . 
but , i mean , yeah .
do you watch cartoons a lot ? 
no . 
it seems like , uh , 
i'm going to school right now 
oh , yeah , 
where do you go to school ? 
b y u . 
oh , really ? 
i'm going to u t d here in dallas . 
oh , really ? 
my dad taught there 
oh , really ? 
what did he teach ? 
uh , speech pathology . 
oh , that's what i'm majoring in . 
i'm a graduate student in speech . 
oh , wow! 
no way . 
how long have you been there ? 
uh , this is my first semester . 
oh , okay , 
so you wouldn't know him . 
he used to work at , uh , uh , university of texas at d , 
i can't remember what it's even called now , 
but , uh , he worked there for like fifteen years and then part time u t d at night . 
oh , yeah . 
and then they stopped funding the program there .
and so now he's at texas women's university . 
oh , really ? 
oh , is he teaching speech pathology there ? 
what's his name ? 
allen bird . 
b i r d ? 
he published a paper , uh , couple of years ago , i think , didn't he , well , one that i read . 
does he publish quite a bit ? 
and he has some like different programs out , 
like i don't know what they're called , 
but they're like , 
and he has like little stuffed animals with them and 
i don't know that , 
a testing battery . 
he uses real , 
i remember . 
well , that's interesting . 
uh , what are you studying ? 
uh , i am studying nursing 
but i'm thinking about changing right now .
i don't know , 
and it's really tough to get into the program down here 
so if i decide to stay in nursing i'll probably come and go to t w u . 
oh , yeah ? 
yeah , 
i'm living in the t w u dorm across from collier , uh , 
oh , really ? 
and , uh , 
my dad used to teach at collier , too . 
that's where the speech program is . uh , 
i'm living in that dorm 
and there , all those nursing majors . 
i tell you what , 
that's a tough , uh , field , though . 
nursing is . 
i have a lot of respect for those people . 
i mean , they've spent a lot of hours studying .
so , you're at baylor ? 
oh , okay . 
brigham young . 
i see , 
all right . 
on the nineteenth 
and i'm so excited .
oh , really ? 
i'm so homesick . 
do you like s , 
oh , is it ? 
but yeah , 
do you ? 
but , i've been away too long . 
i'm from colorado , 
so i've been away from there too long .
uh , how , 
all set . 
good morning .
let's see , 
music , um , 
well , i play a couple of instruments . 
i try to . 
what do you play ? 
um , clarinet is my primary instrument , 
and i also play a little bit of saxophone , flute and piano 
that's too bad .
how about yourself ? 
i play , uh , the violin 
 and i run a municipal band 
and i sometimes conduct . 
oh , wow . 
so , i'm pretty busy too . 
i play in three different symphony orchestras . 
we have a 
that's great . 
i play in the altoona symphony , 
was about fortyfive miles away 
 and i play in a slightly smaller one called the lockhaven 
so are you a professional musician ? 
only should have been . 
i spend about half my time playing music or preparing for it somewhere . 
but , uh , i've been working at , uh , penn state 
i understand , 
i'm in one community band here , 
and that's just , 
well , we rehearse once a week . 
we generally have a concert every other week 
you have one that often . 
that's amazing because 
that's a lot . 
well , one thing is , we have a summer series , 
and every single sunday night we play at the library to have a little 
 and so we do that every sunday night 
you are busy . 
and then , i don't know . we just have an awful lot of engagements , 
and we're just having to turn a lot of people down , um , because , you know , uh , we don't want to do things like have a concert back to back or even two days in a row . 
where do you get all this music , 
i mean , you must back up and play some of the music twice . 
oh yes , 
you know , you get your little sousa book 
and you just flip through it , and that sort of thing . 
oh , okay . 
so you don't play pretty well a full concert band music most of the time then . 
it really depends on who shows up . 
um , and it's always a mystery , 
because it actually doesn't matter who shows up , 
it matters what instruments they brought , 
because so many 
but , um , yeah , 
in the winter we do more concert stuff 
how many people in your band ? 
um , i think there's about seventy . 
seventy . 
there's a lot . 
holy mackerel , 
but , on any given night there's not seventy 
it alternates quite a lot . 
that is a huge organization , 
that's great . 
it really is . 
because about the best i can normally hope for is about fifty 
but that fills a stage and keeps us busy , 
but uh , a lot of them are from , uh , faculty at penn state here . 
oh , okay . 
and so they want to play things that , uh , push them to do . 
so that's why we have to work real hard when we get a concert together . 
we have about four concerts per year indoors 
and the last one we did was in a large , uh , mall close here , 
we played christmas about an hour out in this mall . 
so that worked out very nicely . 
that's fun . 
well , let's see . 
well , there's another band around here . 
someone at work is trying to get me to join that one , because they need clarinet players 
 and their concert schedule isn't as heavy , 
but they have more in the summer , 
i think they have ten in the summer , you know , one week after the other . 
i think they're like monday nights 
are you just saying you sight read every concert ? 
some of them are . 
and where does this happen , laurie , 
is this in dallas ? 
we're real close to dallas . 
well , i declare . 
that's amazing . 
well , i think it's very much more of a social group than anything else , you know . 
and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and 
do any of you , in your group get paid for any of this ? 
we do get some money from the city 
um , i think he's the only one that gets paid . 
and you do have to buy your music . 
who sponsors you basically , the city ? 
yeah , uh , 
my band is sponsored through what they call parks and recreation . 
it's a similar thing . 
i can't remember what they call it , 
but the same type of thing . 
um , but we do get an awful lot of music , you know , 
we can borrow music from any of the area colleges 
 or , you know , if some group just isn't going to play any more , they'll just give us their music , and that type of thing . 
and we do an awful lot of , you know , 
we don't charge for any of our performances , 
but we get a lot of donations . 
well , i work the same way .
well , i'll be darned . 
it's amazing . 
well , what do you think ? 
well , providing universal health care insurance for the whole country is a pretty big task 
and uh , personally , i don't approve of it for two reasons . 
number one is that i think that , uh , the federal government has a problem with the deficit right now , 
and if they were to administer this , they would , uh , get us more and more into debt , further than we can ever get out ourselves . 
number two i think that the quality of health care would go down because the competition would be dried up 
and really no one bureaucratic mess . 
and , uh , i've seen what it has done in other countries 
and so uh , i don't think we should head in that direction . 
although that we have problems right now 
and i do agree that they exist 
because health care insurance for everyone is skyrocketing 
and it's become to a point where basically no one can afford it anymore . 
how do you feel about the whole ordeal ? 
well , i agree that it's a big task , 
but i think that the u s should move toward some kind of national health care plan . at least as a long term kind of goal . 
and possibly , just starting with more regulation of health insurance and that sort of thing , 
but i think that ultimately it would be a good idea to , uh , 
and not have a completely socialized ,
uh , just because it seems that , uh , health insurance costs are sky rocketing , well , as fast as the national deficit 
oh , yeah . 
and so that , 
what you're think , 
so what you're 
is that 
or do you think that , 
i don't think that that would necessarily be such a bad idea . 
and ,  , 
well , with the costs as they are right now , do you think that the government , uh , 
because what that would require is for us to pay , uh , more taxes 
and to pay for health insurance for everyone , whereas right now 
and they provide their own health insurance . 
well , as it is now , the middle and upper classes are paying more than their share for the health care of the whole country because they're the only people that can afford health insurance 
and so that the other people have no health insurance 
and , you know , they'll get medical care anyway at least in emergencies 
and basically the people paying for it are the people who are buying health insurance 
so i don't see that this situation would get any worse . 
that way it might get better . 
i kind of disagree .
the reason being is , uh , we have , 
i don't know , 
i guess it's my fear of the national government and also because the bureaucratic 
and , uh , and , uh , don't allow cases where they might throw them out of business , whereas the federal government if they took over everything , they wouldn't care because they'll never go out of business . 
people would still have to pay taxes , 
the money would have to come from somewhere 
and so you'd s , 
i feel that the cost would increase dramatically also . 
but in the same sense would diminish . 
well , i think , 
first off ,
um , i'm not sure what contributes to air pollution exactly . 
i find it hard to believe that a lot of the hair sprays and things that we use cause the air pollution . 
it doesn't seem like , 
but i guess when you think of it everybody has some sort of aerosol in their home 
and it's kind of dangerous . 
that's true . 
uh , i don't know . 
um , well , i'm close to salt lake 
 and there's mountains , uh , you know , all around . 
but sometimes i think tend to hold a little bit of it in , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
really , it's fairly clean , um , 
i think it's a fairly clean city compared to some , 
but , you know how quite a , 
but you think the mountains are kind of a barrier ? 
oh   .
that's an interesting thought . 
i know there's a lot of plants here , 
when i drive down 
here in texas i know pretty much every place here is relatively flat , 
and so i would think that that would probably contribute to us not having that big of like a smog problem or 
oh , uhhuh . 
we have a real fog problem . um . 
the last few years just and seems to just , um , 
it's kind of like it just stays for a month 
but , uh , gee , 
i don't know what else . 
i gue , 
i know 
i gue , 
i guess i've never really , uh , thought about the fact , like in california they have a lot of smog problems . 
and it's real hilly there . 
so that is probably something that plays a 
i think probably just , uh , a lot of factories , um , you know , they have the smoke stacks , i guess you call them 
that's what i see burning a lot . 
i'm not exactly sure what they're burning . 
i know , uhhuh , there are some oil companies , 
and i'm sure that that contributes a lot 
just the burning of the che , 
aren't they supposed to be coming out with some sort of , uh , special gas or something that doesn't emit certain chemicals or something ? 
oh , i don't know . 
i haven't heard that . 
i know , uh , 
i don't know how your emissions test is on your cars or anything , 
but they differ from state to state . 
oh , okay . 
but , um , you know , that's been a new thing in the last 
and i guess some cars are a lot worse than others . 
i think those , uh , 
what are they , 
i know , 
a rabbit's one , diesel 
the diesel . 
the diesel cars . 
oh , yeah . 
they seem to put out quite a bit .
i know a lot of people with diesels 
   truck , you know . 
but , um . 
well , um , are you working for t i ? 
oh , okay . 
i work in waco at a t v station . 
my mother works at t i . 
oh , uhhuh . 
that's why , 
and that's how you got involved . 
yeah . 
you work at t i ? 
oh , okay . 
we have , um , 
and they kind of got us involved that way . 
oh , okay . 
that's interesting . 
 but . well , i don't know . 
 what else causes air pollution ? um , 
noise causes air pollution   .
i've got , 
speaking of noise , you can probably hear my little . 
he is quite noisy . 
i don't know . 
i know that , um , 
don't dumps , you know , where you dump all your 
i'm sure that does . 
i know they're always churning that up 
we just . 
 and i think they burn a lot there , too . 
we just had a big , uh , thing here in waco . 
they're needing to open a new landfill , or to expand onto the old landfill . 
and , uh , it's really been a big fight because a lot of the people that live by the landfill don't want it expanded , because they're thinking that they're water is going to be contaminated somehow . 
and so they , 
well , i don't think i'd like that . 
you know , we , um 
when we've taken things to the dump , just the dump , uh , that is , uh , you know , closest to us , 
and i know that on windy days , you know 
oh , yeah . 
and they've got those big bulldozers , 
and you can see the dust 
and i'm sure that their homes are really quite 
oh , is there . 
worried about their 
they've been fighting over it for the last year , 
and they just now approved it . 
so they're going to try an appeal or something . 
what do you like to cook ? 
uh , i don't cook a lot actually . 
i have just started baking , 
so , uh , i am kind of interested in cakes and , uh , muffins and stuff like that , 
but i can't seem to get them exactly right . 
so , i am just trying to perfect some things . 
i tried to make an applesauce cake . which i will never ever try to make again . 
it was horrible .
 oh dear . 
i don't know if the cake was horrible or if i made it horrible . 
 oh , probably not . 
i , uh , have , uh , a bread recipe that is real easy that everyone always really does like .
and , it is wonderful . 
it is , 
and what is funny is that you use , uh , bran , all bran 
 and it looks like it is a wheat bread . 
but , it is actually all bran flour 
 and , uh , you know , it is just regular 
the type that , you know , yeast and that sort of thing 
 and you let it rise 
and you can let it rise in the refrigerator and then punch it down , and then , uh , make your rolls . 
they really are good 
 and they are so easy to do . 
that is 
seems like every time that we have a dinner party , or that we are going some place where everybody is suppose to bring something and they have had my rolls before .
they request it . 
i have not gotten any requests yet . 
last year , i had a christmas party , at , uh , my office , 
and i , uh , made the tuna fish sandwiches . 
and uh , i mean , i think , everyone knows how to make tuna fish , 
so i thought that would be easy for me to make 
and i can not go wrong with that , 
and so i made it 
and , uh , i used celery seed in my , 
do you use celery seed in your tuna fish ? 
and i just thought it was so strange , 
because i thought that that was what celery seed was for . 
was for tuna fish . 
oh , how funny . 
but everyone really , really loved the tuna fish 
and they just couldn't get over the fact that i used celery in it 
and it just surprised me . 
celery and onion and , 
 well , see i mean , i have used celery before . 
but i never used the celery seed in it . 
well , what else do you put in it besides the celery seed . 
just like , uh , really fine onions and green pepper and the celery seed 
and i use like , uh , miracle whip salad dressing instead of the actual mayonnaise 
but if you use salad dressing with uh , you know , kind of , i guess a tart taste .
but , nobody else used celery seed . 
i feel so silly 
see , i have never put bell pepper in tuna fish either . 
isn't that funny ? 
i was brought up with tuna fish , you know , where you put in , uh , oh , chopped hard boiled eggs which is 
the standard old tuna fish . 
i would put that too . 
i just did not have those things . 
like i don't think i had eggs that night or something , 
but i would have put eggs . 
i would have put eggs in there also . 
but isn't that interesting ? 
so you , 
uh , strange . 
celery seed . 
i will have to try that . 
sometimes i do 
and sometimes i use the miracle whip . 
it depends on what i have . 
 and sometimes , if i am using , like , regular mayonnaise , to spice it up a little bit 
i do that also . 
just to put a little zing in it . 
but not a bunch . 
but enough to , make it have a little bit more flavor . 
  i love barbecue . 
anything barbecued i will eat . 
i like , uh , to barbecue baby back ribs . 
and , they are so easy to do if you , uh , have a good barbecue sauce 
 and you , uh , just cook them very , very slowly in the oven . 
and it is not hard to cook , like some meals are . 
and of course , it is messy to eat . 
that is the disadvantage . 
and , uh , i make lasagna from scratch 
and people really like my lasagna 
i like to make that too . 
i make that once in a while . 
 and so , uh , sometimes , i am requested to make that . 
and that is not too hard to do because you can do it in advanced and just bake it . 
it is not really , once you have all the ingredients 
it is just the layering really .
that is the hardest part probably . 
but , uh , 
then , i have a wonderful recipe for strawberry pie . 
it just takes forever 
 but , it is , uh , when the strawberries are nice , and big and fresh and yummy . 
do you make cheesecake ? 
uh , uhhuh . 
but it is like a normal pie crust . 
but then you use this sort of , uh , 
it is a cream cheese , uh , uh , layering , 
but you , uh , thin it out a little bit .
and you uh , line the whole pie crust with that 
 and so , it is sort of like in a way . uh , using cheese 
 and it is not a real cheese cake 
and then you , 
 and just put the strawberries , 
ok , 
i was watching the soap opera awards . 
and , uh , it is really making me want to exercise 
because every single woman in the audience is , uh , about ten pounds . 
so . uh , i started uh , 
and , i was really motivated and going , 
and , uh , i went , uh , for a little while , uh . 
i went pretty regular , 
but it is hard to go regularly for a long time . 
and where i live in waco , uh , they do not have anywhere here that is affiliated with president's 
so now i do not have a club 
and uh , i do not have any motivation to just go out and jog aimlessly or something like that , 
so i am not exercising at the moment . 
so , i wish i could . 
i wish i did have the motivation to get out and do that , 
but i just do not like just running with no where to go .
i just cannot do that . 
 well , i understand that . 
i have been trying to get myself motivated . 
i had gotten up regularly for awhile with a neighbor . uh , 
she had injured her back and needed a walking partner 
and i thought that would be the time to get going . 
and so , we walked pretty steadily for about three weeks 
and , uh , then she had to get back to work which was traveling to new york 
and so she is not around . 
and i just don't like walking by myself at night or in the dark of the morning 
i don't seem to find time in the day time . 
and of course , it is motivation that is keeping me from really looking for that opportunity . 
i think a lot of the times , if you have someone to , uh , work out with , or walk with , or something , it does give you that motivation . 
oh , yeah . 
and i mean you can , you know , pretty much do it privately if you had your own private , uh , sort of contest . you know 
and that would keep you going . 
well , more than weight , 
of course , i could uh , lose certainly 
 but i think more than that , 
i also notice i just feel better when i exercise . 
oh , yeah . 
and that is something that i am motivated about now because i do need to get myself feeling better 
but , uh , all the same it is connected to my attitude , 
because i am not feeling as perky and good . 
i am also , 
it is hard to get my attitude uh , to get myself up there . 
that is very true . 
it seems like you walk quicker . 
you just , 
perky is a good word for it 
and i understand that walking is suppose to be like , the best exercise . 
better than running . 
things like that 
cause it works everything 
and you have 
 and it gets your breathing up 
 and it doesn't 
it doesn't hurt you . 
like , i understand running hurt your shins or knees or something like that . 
last time i tried running with my daughter cause she is supposed to be jogging in p e 
and it felt good , 
but then i had pulled a muscle in my knee . 
actually , i hyper extended it or something , 
and , uh 
i was suffering for about three weeks later . 
and i have never had that problem before 
 but i guess that age just starts to catch up to me .
uh , oh .
it is showing up in the weirdest places . 
i guess uh , in the gym , is the bikes . 
oh , is it ? 
to go , 
and if you watch television , they usually have television in there or something , or if you listen to a walkman , it is pretty okay . 
again , that is sort of weird , because you , are not going anywhere 
and , uh , i use to play racquetball 
 and i really liked that , because , you know , to me it had a point . 
you know , uh , there were points you would make 
and there was a point to it , 
but running and jogging and just not going anywhere is just , 
i don't like that , 
i just can't understand that . 
so , i don't do , 
well , i have got a dog now 
and , of course , she needs walking 
uh , yeah . 
 and that is a little less uh , burdensome or boring to be walking at least with her . 
and i can put on the earphones to have something to listen to 
i know a lot of people just to be safe , 
like you were talking about , walking at night and in the morning 
you see a lot of , uh , mostly older people though that , uh , walk in the malls . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , like early in the mornings and things like that . 
i have never tried that . 
i don't know . 
you know , i have never even thought about it really . 
that is kind of an idea . 
we have , uh , over here in plano , a little recreation center that has got , uh , a walking track , 
it is also for security as well as the convenience of doing it any time of the year . 
but , i find it very tedious because i am watching the clock constantly , 
and it 
and i actually get more tired doing that , than 
i could walk for three or four miles out in the neighborhood here and feel real good . 
there i could barely make a couple of miles .
and that is a little less , 
well , what kind of music do you like ? 
well , seeing as how i'm a musician  , i like all kinds of music . 
all very very kinds . 
me too . 
i mostly like classical and jazz . 
well , i like everything from hard core country to you know wagner , and mahler 
and i like new age stuff . 
i basically have a wide range of musical likes . 
uh , are you musical , uh , 
are you a musician at all ? 
do you  ? 
 baroque and romantic . 
there is , uh , things written for doc severenson and , uh , a few other people . 
but , uh , they are just , uh , 
as far as solos and concertos are concerned , 
but the rest of them are just parts .
and , uh , 
well , i love baroque music , 
so , it is one of my favorite periods . 
in fact i sing with a texas baroque ensemble . 
who are the trumpet players ? 
well , we used to have , uh , ralph dutchen . 
but now he is in massachusetts . 
he has come back a couple of times . 
then there is a trumpet player at north texas , the main teacher . 
leonard   .
and he has played . 
and the two of them have played natural trumpets .
and occasionally , when she can't get those people , we use you know , just uh , e flat trumpets , with valves 
and like glen bell plays . 
uh , rick , uh , bogarts played 
 , but actually , i like trumpet and organ together . 
it is a nice combination . 
richard jung julio recorded an album at the same time as    , 
didn't he ? 
with paul . 
he is wonderful . 
both of them are . 
so do you like romantic music ? 
well , mostly the rest of good trumpet marks are romantic music , mahler and ruckner and strauss .
do you like opera ? 
getting use to it .
they are uh , mostly mozart . 
i mean there is not any kind of trumpet parts , 
but , uh , you know , i just like the melodies more 
you don't like puccini ? 
uh , yeah . 
i like more comic licks . 
are you going to go see the elixir of love ? 
do you ever go to the dallas opera ? 
uh , no 
only the fort worth opera .
and my trumpet teacher used to play in the fort worth opera . 
who was your trumpet teacher ? 
john nelson . 
i know him , 
i kind of know him . 
is he still around here ? 
because i have not seen him playing anywhere lately , 
but maybe it is cause he is playing in fort worth .
well , i am basically a church musician . 
i do a church in plano . 
and we do all kinds of music at my church 
and we hire lots of instrumentalists off and on for , uh , different things . 
so , i am always making music of one kind or another . 
which church is it ? 
the christ united methodist church in plano .
it seems like a lot of churches are hiring more musicians now than they use to . 
most churches have the , 
well there are some of the few organizations that have the funds to , uh , you know , do like big big works . h , 
but you know , we hire an orchestra at least twice a year and then different instrumentalists off and on through out the year . 
in fact , we have , 
do you know john qumenato ? 
he plays at our church a lot . 
in fact he is playing this sunday at our church . 
but he plays pretty regularly . 
he is still teaching at brookhaven , 
isn't he ? 
he teaches a lot in plano at high schools 
 uh , yeah . 
 and , i think he teaches at brookhaven . 
because i heard glen bell taught at plano as well . 
glen teaches here too . 
they have cornered the market on trumpet . 
why don't you tell me about your choir . 
well , we , uh , are a group of , uh , musicians that just kind of have , you know , formed out of a desire to sing 
and many of the people in the group are or just real talented i should say . 
lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching . uh , 
others have , 
there's one gal that's in the , uh , plano community orchestra . uh , 
just , you know , different backgrounds . 
it's been really kind of interesting . 
uh , i play the piano 
 and , uh , i have a four year old who has started to play the piano . 
he does that , uh , musically , listens 
and then he can play , which is kind of interesting . 
oh , yeah . 
i think it's because he's always heard music in our home since he was a baby . 
uh , my husband and my other son , who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here , in the community at music man . 
oh , they did ? 
how did , 
uh , basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions . 
it was the plano repertory theatre . 
and so they went and tried out 
and my husband played harold hill from the music man 
and my son played one of the children in a band . 
oh , how fun . 
so , yeah , 
it was really fun , 
and , uh , my son plays the clarinet in his band at school , 
and my daughter takes piano lessons , too . 
but , uh , we just really like music . 
i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off , 
um , uhhuh , 
that's nice . 
you say have your four year old taking lessons already ? 
and , uh , who do you have her , or him , take it from ? 
uh , i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki .
you listen to the music and then learn to play it by hearing the intervals and things like that . 
i teach , uh , like what is traditionally taught , you know , 
you look at the note on the page 
and you play what's on the piano , 
but he can't learn like that . 
he's a delayed child . 
i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things . 
uh , so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it , uh , with his right hand , 
we better have him s , do something . 
so that was really fun . 
 well , because my , 
my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown , though . 
pardon me ? 
 so , my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town 
well , i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five 
 because you know , she just seemed to enjoy it so much 
and now is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play 
and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally . 
she just , 
oh , i think that's great . 
so i wasn't sure when to start her . 
i didn't want to push her too early , either , but , uh , kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene . 
that's really hard i think , especially if you start them 
and then they get pretty good 
and then they get close , ten , you know , eleven or something , 
you know . 
so sometimes it's hard to know exactly when , 
but , i don't know , 
if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it . 
i think she'd like to , 
i just don't know if it's really , 
knowing from what my daughter has gone through , she learned a lot 
and , of course , it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it . 
it was something easily forgotten . 
so , uh , i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight 
or should i say seven . 
i mean , she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally . 
she does have to really work at it , 
uh , so , 
that's like me . 
so i'm kind of , you know , just playing with it , 
but at this point we're going to kind of wait , i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway 
well , it can get expensive 
that's for sure . 
in letting us have my children , uh , do the suzuki method 
oh , that's good . 
so it's been good for our family . 
well , as a piano teacher , do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method , 
have you had any former suzuki students ? 
i was wondering how , 
something happening to me at christmas time that verified to me that i will al , 
well , i don't have an elderly person that i could send to a nursing home or anything . 
both of my parents are dead , 
but i did have a friend that was in a convalescent home , uh , like a nursing home 
and i went there very often to visit her and , uh , made me feel really sad . 
if i did have a mother living , i don't think i could do that . 
i think they would be better off being at home with their family , you know . 
i agree , although , we're in that situation right now . 
we have an eighty seven year old mother in law living with me right now 
 and because of her circumstances she can no longer live independently . 
and even moving from her house to our house 
and we have several young children 
 and they about drive her crazy . 
oh , i can believe that . 
because most elderly people can't take having a lot of noise and kids running around and things like that . 
in a situation like that maybe it would be better . 
well , you know , we've struggled a lot with it because , again , most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me . 
and she's still alert enough that i think she would really know that we were putting her there 
oh , yeah . 
 and i think she would really resent it , 
and i think that would make it very hard . 
but , on the other hand , i see my wife with , 
i guess our youngest one now is five 
and her trying to struggle because her mother really cannot take care of herself . 
she needs to be 
see , now that's really a sad situation . 
and so the drain on the family . 
really , you know . 
why can't they send them home , 
it's too noisy 
so it's a hard situation , either way , i think . 
in a case like that , you know , you more or less think it would be better if she were in a nursing home because you have your family growing up where , 
i think that's one of the things we're really wrestling with . 
when does it become detrimental to our family to the point that you have to consider that 
but the cost of these nursing homes are so ,
oh , prohibitive . 
a lot of people can't afford that . 
you know , so you really have no choice that way you know . 
uh , i know this lady you know , that was a friend of mine , 
now her husband was still alive at the time when she was in there , you know , 
and it was costing him a small fortune to keep her in there . 
i think we need to develop some alternatives like adult day care 
i think if we could send her someplace for the day 
then bring her back home at night . 
you know , just come home for dinner 
and then usually they want to go to bed fairly early anyhow . 
you know , so that would probably be nice if we could ever get something like that 
but there's not many of those available right now 
 and they're very hard to get them into 
but they're really not prepared to cope with her because she's somewhat senile . 
and so a lot of the activities that they're engaged in , she can't participate in . 
but i think it's an issue that , you know , 
with the graying of america , we're really going to have to , as a country figure out how we're going to deal with this . 
because it is a difficult situation 
and , you know , you hate seeing them just , sort of send off and not well cared for . 
and yet , 
but if they have their wits about them and everything , why , it's kind of hard .
and then i think it depends on their physical ability , too , you know , 
if they could be up and doing some things 
well , uh , my mother always said she hopes she never had to be like that 
and , uh , luckily , i mean , she lived by herself 
and then , you know , one day she had a heart attack 
and she was gone , 
so she never did have to go into a nursing home or anything like that , 
but there's , so many of us kids , there was like seven of us that , we wouldn't have probably allowed that to happen anyhow . 
you know , she could have taken turns living with each one of us , you know , for nor the same state 
do you live at all close to each other ? 
uh , i have a couple more that live out here in california , 
but then i have a broth , 
uh , short term , uh , it works out pretty well because we have just enough to cover expenses with a little left over 
so budgeting in the short term isn't too much of an issue because there's not that much , uh 
uh , long term is gee , 
she's eight now 
so i guess about ten years . 
so we're starting to think about long term considerations . college and retirement . 
but with not a whole lot of discretionary money , it's kind of hard to figure out how to do it . 
how about you ? 
that's kind of , uh , 
to what we're doing is budgeting , you know . 
month to month is , uh , kind of taking into consideration what the bills are and what's extra 
so that's kind of how we do it , uh , from month to month depending on what insurance is due or whatever . 
uh , long term , that's a little bit easier for us because , uh , with our jobs we can take out extra money towards savings , four oh one k plans 
so we can kind of put aside some money that actually is better for us not to see 
and you have to try and take out some of that money . 
you always find something a little extra that you'd like to get that month 
so , uh , long term probably is a little bit better than short term simply because , uh , it's automatically taken out . 
so , uh , that works out much better for us , 
so that's kind of how we do it anyway 
and the old , uh , if you can't see it , then you can't spend it , uh , idea .
 and if you can't touch it , you can't spend it either . 
so that kind of works out where you get into , uh , some plans that , you know , you touch it you're going to get a penalty , that kind of thing , 
i'm going to keep it and , uh ,  , 
let's hope anyway , 
so that's kind of how we do it . 
but ours is more like month to month too , uh , 
short term is , to get things going 
so . anyway , other than that , uh , is kind of how we do it 
uh , they'll , uh  , 
we actually do have some money in a four oh one k . 
i just 
oh , definitely , 
and , uh , it grows , uh , 
it seems like at first you're not going to see a big return 
but as the years go on , if you're with the company for any length of time then it gets much better 
and there's other savings plans or other things that you can do . 
automatic , you know , deposit from checks to where you don't see it . 
and , uh , you know , exactly whatever is in our checking account is basically just about what gets spent . 
it's put into our savings account 
and we don't see it , 
then it works out to where , you know , you don't look at it , 
and that's it , 
checking account's a very dangerous place for money to be i'm convinced . 
it's easy because you do spend it , 
that's for sure . 
like i said , you know , you kind of look at it , uh , 
you better have some other way of , uh , savings , 
otherwise , uh , checking accounts aren't the best for , you know , long term type of planning , 
and you don't get a good return on it anyway , 
so , other , 
i guess other than things like the stock market or mutual funds , there's really not much of a return on anything these days . 
right now . 
it's a bad time , you know . 
the interest is so low . 
i mean it's nice for people buying homes 
you know , we have some inlaws , uh , that , uh , had theirs in some money market certificates and other things and , uh , kind of took them out of that because they got so low 
but , uh , 
it drops 
so your better bet is to , uh , try to get in with something with your corporation if they have some kind of , uh , savings plans or something like that to where they kind of match the percentage or whatever or some kind of profit sharing 
i'm with a small company now 
and i hope uh , if we're successful that they'll go in for some sort of profit sharing 
that'll be very nice . 
that's great , 
well , uh , just briefly . 
uh , i worked in a nursing home 
so i kind of know , from way back , uh , how things used to be run 
and i think there has been definite changes of nursing homes 
but i think , uh , if i had to personally put one of my parents in a nursing home , they would have to be pretty bad off to where i couldn't take care of them at all . 
it would be something that , 
if they're forgetting things or whatever , i'd prefer to have them at home or have them in what they call now home care 
and they cook meals 
and they clean their house for them , 
that kind of thing , 
so they still have their own independence 
and not reliable , you know , 
they don't have to be in a nursing home situation . 
but , uh , i don't think 
the nursing homes , when i was working in them , were very much understaffed , very much , uh , in need of good personnel . uh , 
i think the patients weren't given the quality of care that 
i wouldn't have , you know , 
i got out of that kind of situation . 
and they were not given the money , basically , to staff , appropriately , people to help . 
and i can remember lifting a patient all by myself , simply because there was not another person to help . 
it's either leave the patient in bed all day long or get them up 
and i would have preferred to get them up than to leave them in bed all day . 
have changed . 
i'm not quite sure , 
but hopefully , they have . 
i guess i haven't had that much experience . 
i've only seen like my great grandparents in a nursing home 
 and then she got sick 
and she ended up in nursing home 
 and my parents went to visit her 
and it got to the point where it seemed like the nursing home didn't want to deal wi , her anymore 
 and so they gave her drugs to keep her asleep . 
that can happen 
and i think in the nursing home that i worked for , 
i wasn't quite sure of it , 
but i'm sure that some of the patients were , uh , given medication to keep them uh , quiet 
nice sedative state . 
and they would just lay all day long 
and , uh , the ones tha , 
they also put mentally ill patients in the same , 
they were not on the same , you know , ward , 
but they were in the same nursing home 
so these mentally ill patients could walk into where the other , uh , older people that were in there for reasons of , uh , you know age , uh , 
the mentally ill patients could walk right into the rooms or do whatever they wanted to basically . 
because if you weren't there to watch them and keep them in their own wing , they had freedom to just walk around 
and i think there was a couple that were schizophrenic 
and i remember one time watching one of the , uh , schizophrenic patients actually go out on , i don't know what they call it , a binge or whatever you want to say it 
she grabbed a hold of this , 
and it was kind of funny when i looked back at it , 
but , i mean , i remember the patient getting very upset . 
that woman actually pulled , uh , the other person's hair . 
i mean she just came up right behind him and pulled his hair , you know , 
and it was a guy that was just really upset . 
and i laughed at it then 
if i had to put my parents in that nursing home , i wouldn't want them there . 
even though they're aging mentally ill , they are still mentally ill 
and a lot of these older people you know , they're not insane or anything like that . 
they don't have these tendencies to lash out . 
to be violent . 
but seeing that kind of made me think twice about , 
i wouldn't put my mother , father in that nursing home at all . 
a small town . 
oh , really ? 
  because  it seems like the small town nursing homes , there's a 
i kind of look at it this way . 
i think if you have a big city area , i think there's more people to keep watch on it . 
you have 
and you have more competition . 
and i think nursing homes have to be better than when there's one nursing home for a whole community . 
and this is back in nineteen seventyseven that i worked there 
it would have to be awfully bad for me to put my parents in there . 
but my grandmother , uh , later on got cancer and , uh , could no longer , 
well actually she , 
do you want to go ahead ? 
we pay far too much in taxes . 
well , far too much for what we get . 
i mean 
i agree . 
well i think , uh , you know , when i look at , uh , all the things that are coming out now about over spending and spending money that's not there and buying things that are extremely expensive where they could buy it at a better discount , uh , 
you mean like those , you know , twenty thousand dollar toilets  ? 
that's exactly , uh , the whole thing . 
when you take a look at all those issues of where our money is going 
and it's just , 
as long as the person that's spending the money , uh , doesn't think about 
oh , i can go out and spend anything that i want to 
it's just unlimited , 
it's real easy to spend other people's money . 
an unlimited source 
and i could have went to kmart and bought it for , you know , ten or fifteen .
i mean , that kind of thing 
and , uh , 
i don't mind them getting what they need . 
it's just when they pay so much for it . 
  it takes  you know , very little to just shop around and , 
and i know a lot of , uh , corporations now are looking at their amount of money that's being spent 
and they're looking 
that's true .
it used to be if you had a company you had to go through certain people 
and you didn't care what you paid . 
i mean you just got it done . 
now people are putting in bids for things and are looking at things . 
going to actually shop at best buy best buy is one of our electronic stores 
and you can go to another shop and get it for maybe sixty cents or ninety cents 
that kind of thing 
i'm also wondering why our taxes are still so high considering like the world's probably in better shape now than it has been in the last fifty years .
except for everything keeps going up , you know . 
and i know as a middle class , uh , you know , 
and also i have one dependent has 
and i keep looking at well where's the socalled tax , uh , relief 
i know . 
i mean , there is none .
i mean , i think i paid just as much as when 
 oh , i know , 
i mean i don't even , 
between four oh one k and the thirtyfour percent they're taking out for taxes . 
that's the whole thing . 
now they have gotten this wonderful idea of not taking out as much taxes , 
but you're still going to owe the government as much money 
 so by the end of this coming year , what's going to happen is all these people are going to find out that they owe the government 
and it certainly isn't going to be in their savings , uh , account . 
they won't be able to pay . 
and there'll be a lot of problems because of that , you know . 
put people into , you know , january or february which is always suppose to be , 
the month after christmas is supposed to be high spending because everything is on sale . 
nobody's going to have the money to spend . 
 none  .
they're going to be paying on their taxes 
so they're going to have to just cut back 
so , i don't know where the answer is 
 and  , 
i don't , 
 in the first place , you know , there's also like taxation without representation . 
well i don't feel represented anymore in our government . 
i mean , it 
it doesn't take care of my needs .
 well , that's the whole thing . 
i think people are getting so fed up with it . 
now , we go through another election and listen to all these lies about the , 
 and people don't care anymore either . 
people don't want to go out to vote . 
 well , i don't think people think they can make a difference . 
and when you've got candidates as you do . 
it's candidates that have money 
 and it's backed by big business . 
and , uh , you know , you're not going to get anymore abe lincolns 
 well who knows , uh , 
just like the communist government of , uh , the old u s s r . 
we're fed up . 
maybe it'll have to be just individual state tax . 
and each state take care of itself and no government type of , uh , you know , 
where you have to pay out to federal or whatever . 
i don't know . 
who knows 
i'm not .
i don't know , 
i can't think of any easy answers to it 
but something has to happen , 
i mean 
everybody is , 
in fact , i'm not sending in my check  , 
 so what do you think ? 
uh , should young americans be forced to do a year of service ? 
i don't think they should be forced , 
but i think they should be , i guess , encouraged just to get them , i guess involved with community maybe , you know , 
just community activity . 
if nothing else , see how the city works , stuff like that . 
i think something like the peace corps is a bit harsh . 
no kids , 
i think so , too . 
i think that's a bit dramatic , 
it's a good idea to get them involved in city and community activities and , you know , like the , uh , shelters and , uh ,  , that kind of , thing ,
i think it's a little harsh to say that they should have to spend a year or two . 
i'd force them . 
i think a lot of kids actually do a lot of work 
and no one just realizes it . 
your right , 
i do , too , 
i think they start out young , like in , uh , girl scouts and boy scouts 
i was a boy scout . 
as part of being a boy scout , you had to do , you know , projects all throughout 
and then to become 
see that's what we did in girl scouts 
and that got you involved real good 
and i think it starts kids out on the right track 
and then it lets them decide if that's what they enjoy doing . 
now i think people generally volunteer . 
that there's no problem with getting them to ,
i do , too . 
uh , and the shelters and stuff like that . 
and even if it is a couple times a year like at the holidays , i mean at least they're getting out and doing it and you know , helping out . 
i think that's good 
well , we have a funny commercial around here . 
force kids to serve for , uh , parents , i guess . 
there you go . 
my kid will do four or five hours this week for me . 
no problem . 
it sounds pretty good .
that sounds good . 
i've noticed a lot of , uh ,  , different organizations in our community , uh , pick up , like on the highway and stuff , 
and i think that's pretty neat . 
they , uh , go along and have so many miles i guess of highway to take over 
 and they clean it up . 
i've seen that . 
and keep it clean . 
i think that's i pretty good idea . 
and i think , you know , again 
i've seen a lot of young kids doing that 
and i think it gets them prepared to learn how to volunteer as they get older . 
i know i did , you know , in girl scouts and everything 
and after that in high school i would volunteer at a nursing home and stuff .
you don't sound like you're in the north . 
you sound like you're in the south somewhere . 
where are you at ? 
yeah , uh , 
i'm in , uh , new york . 
upstate new york , 
oh , gosh . 
and , uh , 
long way , uh , 
and we just had a really big ice storm . 
and , basically , i'm in rochester which is , uh 
 oh , no . 
 that's how bad it was . 
 everything is just down everywhere . 
you know , we had three hundred thousand people without power . 
 you know , it was , 
 and we didn't have power for a week 
and there are still people who don't have power . 
are you serious ? .
oh , yeah , 
and there are still something like ten thousand people without power . 
oh my god , 
how do they live ? 
and we're officially in a state of emergency . 
funny thing is the national news how they covered it . uh , 
i haven't heard a thing . 
i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something 
you know . 
we just got our phone back today , uh , 
and , they're you know , putting out ads now for people to come volunteer ,
well , that's good . 
that's great . 
 because we have , you know , 
everywhere that a tree is down people need help 
and they , 
and we go along 
and , i'm really not sure how we find the individuals , 
but we find older people that cannot afford to fix up their homes that desperately need it , 
and , uh , we go along with all the material and in one day , more or less , go in and say , roof , paint , fix whatever we can . 
oh , that's great . 
and spend a day doing , 
that's really neat . 
i mean , it's not a lot because you're just doing a house at a time , 
but you know , every little bit helps . 
and is that supported by all donations to the church and so forth 
uh , yeah . 
oh , so he , 
so he donates a lot , not everything , but a lot of the material . 
then what he doesn't donate we just go out and buy . 
that's real nice . 
and you know , we don't promote it a lot outside the community because we don't want recognition for it , you know 
so it's real neat . 
and i bet it gives you a real good feeling 
it's not a lot , 
but it helps people . 
like this last couple we helped , you know , they were in their eighties 
and she was bedridden 
and , you know , just tears your heart out to 
and you know , if you can do any a little bit , it helps , 
so  , 
uh , that's real good . 
 uh , we had organizations like that in college , you know . 
we had a community service group in college that had all sorts of different groups 
and some did elderly visits , 
 uh , some did , you know , big brother , big sister , stuff like that . 
and i'm convinced some sort of group . you know , 
that's great . 
that's a lot . 
you know . twentyfive , i don't know . twentyfive percent ? .
my wife was big in that .
that's a lot of kids , though . 
 and she thinks , yeah , 
twentyfive percent . 
it was a small school .
oh , well , 
but , uh , 
but , i mean , a lot of people would get involved 
you know , because there were all different ,
there was big brother , big sister , 
they had a yearly auction , 
they had a dance marathon for charity or , to support that ,
that's neat . 
such that , you know , lots of people got involved that way . 
that's great . 
that's great . 
but , uh , like , i'll agree with you , though , 
i don't think they should have to do a year .
neither do i . 
i think it should be completely optional 
some people i don't think have , uh , a year in them to volunteer if you know what i mean . 
they're not worth it .
they're not worth a year . 
or some people just can't even afford it ,
i mean , 
oh , yeah , 
that's true , 
people get shipped off 
and then their parents , 
i have or daughter is in the peace corps in guatemala right now . 
and , you know , he and his wife just went off to visit her 
and , you know , i know i could never afford to go visit a kid in guatemala . 
i couldn't either . 
you know , so  , 
so i think , you know , 
and the kid's certainly not making much money . 
 so i can see where that , 
i just know one person that's in the peace corps 
and , i mean , she's a teacher and just wanted to do it . 
she'd been a teacher for a while . 
just decided she wanted to do it , 
so . i mean , i'm grateful for people like that , 
just take off a year . 
i don't , 
i wish i could do something like that , 
but i can't , 
so  , 
well neither can i , 
so , i , 
and i'll do my little community service throughout , but never 
that's the way i am . 
i know the feeling . 
so i guess our vote is no .
we're against it .
well , it's been nice talking to you again . 
you , too , 
and i hope everything works out up there . 
well , yeah , 
we're slowly getting everything back together again . 
you know , it's taking time , 
we got lucky . 
we had no damage to our house or anything 
that's great . 
well , good luck . 
all right , uh , 
i guess i don't have a real technical knowledge for what happened 
i gather that there where large numbers of situations where loans were made that appeared to be a good loan but in a speculative since 
and with little regulation going on because of deregulation during the reagan eight years , uh , more and more s and l simply began to take riskier and riskier loans 
and then when they began to collapse one after the other i think almost like an avalanche of property values devalued . 
kind of like a domino's effect . 
i don't have a field for whether or not this is the equivalent of what was called the teapot dome .
oh ,   .
are you familiar with that ,
uh , i vaguely recall 
but i've never gone and done any study on it since the s and l thing 
that teapot dome scandal is was sold at really inflated prices on the theory that there were natural gas beneath it , 
and that appeared to be corruption within the hoover administration . 
i don't have a real since of like corruption that caused s and l all though i have a feeling that people look the other way when things began to go sourer maybe . 
i don't think it was really corruption that caused it , 
or within 
i think people just started , you know , you know , whenever they gave them out . 
i think maybe they didn't check into them enough 
or maybe because everyone else was doing they figured they would just go ahead and approve it also 
yeah . 
it seems like there were on awful a lot of people making loans and business decisions on a 
get rich quick is the wrong phrase 
i'll move on to this other company , 
and i don't know whether that's because they had other opportunities to which they could move , you know , that it was that easy for them to find new work that they weren't stuck to where they were 
and things begin to collapse 
they just moved on . 
i'm not sure . 
i'm rather puzzled about the ,
uh , i know a little bit about it 
but i don't as much as i should know about it 
i'm a finance major here at clarion . 
and , um , i do know that one of the reasons that caused it is the fact that the federal reserved backed any loan that the savings and l made with a hundred thousand dollars . 
so they were kind of insured with that hundred thousand dollars 
and i think that's kind of why they were making the riskier loans , 
well , they didn't have a since of risk . 
oh , okay . 
almost any type of loan 
and like some banks , you know , they're limited to the types of loans that they're allowed to make . 
and i think the s and l s were more open with the types of loans that they were allowed to make . 
and i think if they would be more bound to certain loans and not as high of insurance by the reserve , then i don't think this would have happened . 
well do you think there's a final accounting , yet not , in the since of pennies an nickels , 
for awhile it seemed like every time i opened the paper up it was escalating in terms of damage , uh , 
is your since that we now understand how bad it is , *[[listen
or is there more to be heard yet . 
um , i think that people just basically got tired of hearing it 
and it was wasn't as good news as it was . 
i think it's still , you know , adding up , 
and i think it will be for awhile . 
so you don't think necessarily they don't have a complete grasp yet , 
or whether   .
i don't think they do . 
how much was really lost or how much they were going to lose , because there still are some s and ls still open . 
and it's very possible for them to go down in the future because of this . 
to be caught in the   .
do you think that it will help with the regular banks ? 
i don't know . 
i think it would be harder 
but i think there are some regular banks that will go down with it . 
it seems that i recall reading relative to the loaning funds to third world countries like mexico , venezuela .
and then the price of oil had gone south resulting in those loans being very risky , 
and i guess i read articles of various banks that have done the right thing to contain their risks given that they had made multiple billion dollar loans . 
i have this vague since that , that could happen that there are still monies loaned out to third world countries that could end up being totally lost . 
oh , yeah , um , 
in some of my classes now i was just  reading  
i think it was in venezuela 
i can't remember what company it was , 
but they just wrote off like millions of dollars because they know they will never get it back . 
you know , and they just wrote it right off . 
i think we've lost a lot of money 
and , you know , like we never going to get it back 
it's impossible to get it back . 
and so you think that it's just gone . 
cause you know , we're talking about some peens that have just like even gave up on like getting it back and trying any more . 
they just totally wrote it off their book . 
do you think it is necessary to have the federal guaranty program 
like my since is it was there to try to protect small investors 
but it ended up protecting big investors .
so i guess i feel like as long as we have the possibility for this large numbers of people to be protected the possibility exist for these sorts of problems . 
um , yeah , 
it's just for , you know , safe purposes , you know , in case something would happen . um , 
i ne , 
as long as there's enough little companies we're going to have to have something . 
um , so your since is really were accounts guaranties ,
and given that the s and ls have had disasters then their money is still being protected . 
and it's million of people with anywhere from thousands to tens of thousands i guess of , 
it seems like , um , there was a lot of money being protected in multiple accounts , uh , 
billion dollars 
and we're taking about monies way in access of that now 
so it's obvious that we've protected large accounts . 
and perhaps multiple people in multiple s and ls 
you know that the , for , 
i guess i'm content with the need to have protection on accounts 
but i feel likes it's on an individual basis . 
someone whose got accounts in thirtyfive different s and ls or thirty or forty thousand dollars 
and they're all protected by the government . 
seems to me like they've gotten around what was  ,
i guess i don't have a personal since of v on it since i ,
and let alone any of them that went bankrupt . 
and i guess that means that from my perspective it could happen again , 
i think it could happen , 
because that means ,
it's kind of thing where maybe we'll survive 
then it will happen again because we don't pay attention to those kinds of things . 
i think it'll happen again 
but i think it will be a long time in the future before it does happen again . 
because i think like the bank people in any kind of people like that are going to be worry enough not to let it happen again in the near future . 
but i think later on they're going to start and forget about and start making the riskier loans 
because i mean , you're going to have to take some risk 
and as long as their backed i think they're still going , you know , start taking on riskier loans , 
and i think there is a chance of it possibly happen again but not until , you know , late , you know , in the future . 
well , perhaps if there are regulatory , uh , constraints put back in place .
maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation , uh . 
well , my family moved to texas about eight years ago . 
my husband was raised here , by 
i have never lived here , 
so , um , when we came back to texas , i was really kind of excited . 
there wasn't a state income tax 
and there wasn't a tax on food that we purchased at the grocery store and things . 
and all of that was new to me , 
because i'm sort of feeling like we're getting a better deal here  , than what i was accustomed to . 
did you move from the northeast ? 
and um , both places had pretty good state income tax . 
and , um , we've always paid tax , you know , on everything we purchased , even food at the grocery store . 
so , i thought it was really , you know , kind of a pretty good deal not to have to pay tax on your groceries 
i mean , i don't enjoy paying taxes . 
and it's hard , 
but , um , i think that is what we have to and have the services that we need 
and we have to pay for them and pay for the employment of the people that run them and things like that 
and i think , i guess , what i feel is that most people , um , they don't like to pay taxes because they feel like there's some people that aren't paying their fair share . 
i think , 
and , um , that makes you feel bad . 
people that can really influence the government have all the money to throw . 
and you know , um , when last year the elections were going , on the governors election and state and , you know . 
i didn't have anything against clayton williams personally or anything , 
but , um , it was kind of hard for me to think , here's someone as wealthy as he is , 
didn't have to pay any income tax . 
that he said that year , 
he claimed , he didn't have to pay income tax 
and he thought , you know , 
there's some people are living pretty good life styles , 
but they're not paying income tax . 
and that's not fair ,
and there's , you know , some people , you know , who are abusing the systems that we pay taxes to support 
and all that makes us feel bad . 
but i think , all in all , how i feel , is that , um , i'm willing to pay the taxes because i think i like our country compared to the other countries i've studied and visited . 
and i'm willing to pay extra to live here and to enjoy the services that i enjoy . 
how do you feel ? 
well , yeah . 
i agree that you have to pay taxes for the services you get 
so , i guess , in texas with , 
we live here also , 
and that it's mostly sales tax , 
so really the people that have money to buy things are paying the more because they're paying the sales tax on the larger items that they buy and stuff . 
i've lived in texas most of my life . 
we , um , lived in kansas city for a couple of years , 
and we were kind of in for a rude awakening . 
they had personal property taxes on like cars 
and , the first year we were there it was kind of like , eight hundred dollars , 
oh , no . 
and we're like   .
my husband says i used to complain to pay sixty dollars to get licensed in texas 
and now ,
so , i mean , that was kind of different 
and then to file a state income tax , was also kind of tough , too . 
i guess , since we've been married , we've moved a lot , 
so it always seems like , you know , we're always paying taxes for something . 
and it was kind of nice this year to finally be able to get a little money back . 
so i then , have also done tax returns in the past for other people when i worked for an accounting firm . 
and , uh , you know , it is kind of sad to see how the people that have the resources to hire somebody and have the money to spend to put there money in places , they don't have to pay taxes . 
or to buy something that loses money so that they can offset the income that they get or whatever . 
so , you know , i can understand why the rich people don't want to pay ,
because , you know , that's not really fair , either . 
if they've earned money by themselves , well , you know , people just kind of  given  the money , 
it's kind of depressing sometimes , i think . 
well , it is , 
and sometimes , i think , um , well , for myself , that income that we have , we pay a certain salary , 
but , i think the employer keeps in mind this will be deducted , you know , 
so many taxes will be deducted from it 
and so , i think , you know , our salaries are a little bit higher because we have to pay taxes on it . 
and so , i think , you know , in that way , we're compensated , um , just by our society . um , 
yet , you know , they don't pay you , um , just what it would take , 
and if you pay taxes on it , you wouldn't have any money left over . 
i guess , because i'm not one of them  , 
well , yeah , 
that's true .
they couldn't live that kind of life style anywhere else . 
in that , 
even if they made that kind of money , there's some countries that have like , fifty percent income tax , you know , that have ,
um , they wouldn't be able to enjoy the   in that . 
so you know , they need to be willing to pay a little bit more for it . 
they've earned it . 
and yes , 
they have such great fortune here , 
but they need to pay for it , too , because they couldn't do it somewhere else . 
um , i like texas , um , not having the state income tax 
and i hope that 
because , um , we've had enough industry here , that , i guess it , 
is that why we don't have 
industry here is able to fund the state because we have oil here and things , 
i mean , that's what i've always heard . 
is that , um , 
big boom . 
there's something about , um , the industry in the state ,
there's enough . 
i know , we moved here from houston 
and the city had enough money . 
it was really nice that they had , um , that 
they began to cut back because of the oil problems , 
but , um , they would have , um , so many community outdoor theaters and , 
that the , 
it was such nice services to offer the residents in the city 
and i really liked that . 
don't you have to , 
why people decided to expect certain services , 
then , they don't really think they should pay for them , maybe . 
i don't know . 
that's true . 
and i , you know , like 
the property tax that we pay is so much higher than my parents pay in missouri . 
but , um , with , 
we have some good schools . 
the school thing might be changing 
and i'm willing to sacrifice , i guess . 
i'm not going to be the type of person that's going to grumble about the taxes , even though we're paying a pretty high percentage . 
i feel like you get what you pay for 
and i want to be here 
and i enjoy living here in this country 
and having seen other countries , i'd much rather live here and pay taxes ,
anyway , well , i guess , i better let you go . 
 well , it was nice talking to you . 
it was nice . 
i see . 
anyway , well , good luck to you . 
you , too . 
my name's ken , 
hi ken , 
my name's diane . 
and , um , you're in texas , 
everybody's in texas . 
i'm in rochester , new york . 
everybody else but one has been in texas . 
okay , um , 
do you think that the soviet union represents a threat to us ? 
i think they'll always represent a threat whether or not there's an active cold war or not . uh , 
and , uh , different priorities , 
and , uh , given the , uh , military powers on both sides , i think it's always a threat . 
that's interesting . 
i don't , 
i suspect they're not our biggest threat anymore . 
probably not , 
i suspect it's probably some crazy man like saddam hussein 
but , um , i wonder how much of a threat they are . 
i agree with you it's just so big , 
and there's just so much military machine there . 
and it's recognized that the two great powers 
and the great powers are always pitted against each other . 
but i wonder how much longer they're going to be them . 
i don't know .
they're going downhill pretty steady . 
but i agree right now they're not , 
i don't believe they're a large threat right now . 
i think there's always some threat . 
oh , i agree . 
i mean , of unity against us or something 
actually i feel kind of sorry for them right now , because the people are , uh , wanting things that we have that they're not allow , 
i mean , just some basic freedoms , 
and their government is not allowing it , 
and gorbachev seems to be going back on some of the things that he's been trying to push . 
so , he's actually , 
he , i think , is becoming very dangerous 
and i think he's also making , um , the military angry at him . 
i mean , i've heard stories now um , the military is running around , 
and they're sort of getting restless , 
and a restless military is the kind of thing that happens , you know 
like with the baltic states when they just go in there 
divvy the people up . 
see , i'm concerned that since he's banned demonstrations altogether , that he's going to do the type of thing that happened in tiananmen square , 
and he's going to wipe out , no telling how many of his 
and , uh , it's going to cause more civil war than is already occurring . 
that's interesting . 
i wonder , 
i don't know if he's , 
he seems , 
the thing about gorbachev strikes that he wouldn't be that dumb .
i don't know though . 
i mean , and it might be something that he wouldn't be able to control . 
that's something that really true 
  sort of a military thing i was speaking of before . 
that's certainly true . 
gorbachev said you can't do it , 
and we're to not let you do it , you know . 
yeah , 
that's real scary , actually . 
i mean , i would expect their own problems would keep them away from us for a while , 
but it could be real dangerous . 
we've got our own worries at the moment . 
we don't need to worry about them . 
i guess as long as , uh , they're fighting each other , we don't have to worry about them wasting their time with us . 
but wouldn't it be nice if no one had to fight anybody else . 
that's an impossibility , i think 
and people are just too different . 
well , i don't know . 
i think that as different as everybody thinks . 
but unfortunately , people aren't that insightful . 
well , that's certainly true of it . 
they just see that this guy prays differently and to someone else than i do . 
so , therefore , he's wrong 
and he's bad , 
and we have to wipe him out . 
that's true . 
this poem , everything i wanted to know i learned in kindergarten , or something . 
you've read that one before . 
i've heard all about it , though . 
is , what i think we should all revert to . 
the idea that , um , 
and in kindergarten we learned to share , 
and we learned to , um , play with each other , 
we learned to take nap , and to take naps , 
and whenever we'd start a fight we'd all apologize and hug each other 
and that would be all . 
if we could just do the same thing sort of , we'd be fine . 
but people grow up , 
and they forget . 
because i often sort of wonder how , having never been to the soviet union , um , how different the people there really are , you know . 
how much    , 
that's one of the places i would most like to go . 
not right now , of course 
 but at some point i would like to go to moscow just to see all these things that you can see on television now and can read about 
ten years ago we didn't have this kind of information 
 and we didn't know what things were like . 
what this is like , 
i mean , this is an example of an entirely different culture that wants to be like us . 
so it would be interesting to watch . 
the people . 
i just feel so sorry for the people in the country , that they can't do any , 
they can't change it . 
they try 
there's nothing that they can do . 
and the ones i even feel somewhat worse for , even , um , 
the ones in like the baltic states 
at least russia has some sort of strong leader . 
i mean they have yeltsin who may yet sort of help russia . 
but , um , i mean , the baltic states , i think , are just sort of trapped . 
you're part of our country . 
you be this way . 
i think it's a sad state of affairs , 
i'm trying to think of the name of the , the    , something like that in northern iraq 
oh , yeah , 
i mean , some of them were split off into israel , i believe , 
and some of them are in turkey 
and they were split up into three different countries . 
and that . 
and they're very dissatisfied , 
and they're causing wars right now , 
and i don't think it's that different from what the baltic states are going through . 
um , um , um , uh , actually it sounds i mean , very similar . 
they were sort of forced , 
we want our piece . 
and they have like a problem , 
they have   muslims to deal with 
i mean i think their big problem up there is , you know , unfortunately , 
not only are they vic , 
there's more than one group fighting for the same place . 
they all want the , you know , 
we just want this little tiny piece of land . 
the one that i think , 
one of the women that i work for is married to an iranian , 
and so she has a lot of insight , because she knows a lot of the history 
and within five or six countries there are probably ten cultures of people , 
and they don't all have their own country , 
and some of them are mad about it .
um , actually , my wife is syrian , 
so also i know some of the history   .
and actually the other funny thing is that i'm jewish . 
we're sort of like the middle east peace talks ourselves . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so i know , 
i've been to israel , 
and i know , 
and i sort of toured the area , 
and i know that it really is lots of different cultures in one place , i mean 
 and out in the soviet union right now . 
you know , there are , 
you can't take a whole bunch of people who just aren't the same people and don't want to be together and put them together forcibly . 
i mean , we did it couple of hundred years ago here , 
but they wanted to do it . 
and i don't think the people here two hundred years ago were that different , 
i really don't . 
that's certainly true . 
i mean , they had the same ideals and the same basic beliefs . 
right , uh , 
i wonder if now the people in the soviet union don't have ideas very different from that . 
the baltic states might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here  . . . 
good morning . 
uh , okay , 
go ahead . 
   , no , 
go ahead . 
so , uh , as you indicated you don't have too much input into the area 
it just so happens that , uh , our daughterinlaw is panamanian , 
and , uh , we have been in panama 
and i have worked in el salvador 
and , uh , we visit mexico occasionally , 
so ,  , yeah , 
we do have a little information on it here , 
but , uh , 
oh , very good , 
because actually , um , when i was in college i visited mexico several times , 
i was in the peace corps and , um , 
oh , uhhuh 
but recently i have been following the middle east rather than ,
it does seem to have quieted down there just a little bit 
that's for sure . 
the u s policy , uh , towards central america as far as , uh , 
well , i kind of go back a plant down there for a while , 
and i worked in there for a little while , 
and at that particular time , 
let's see , 
that was seventythree , seventyfour kind of before the , uh , the civil war really picked up down there , 
and u s policy at that particular time there was , of course , military assistance uh , to the government itself , you know , 
anything that's anticommunist , you know , we kind of had a tendency to be pro .
it don't matter what their excesses were , 
and i believe at the time that i was down there , that , uh , uh , the salvadorian government   you know , really gotten out of hand yet , 
the , uh ,  right wing death squad  type situation 
i believe that , that was beginning to form 
but that i was down there , 
i think that really kind of developed a little bit later on , 
but , uh , our policies seem to be pretty much one of , uh , you know , trying to setup businesses down there and use the one resource , anyway , that salvador had ,  , 
and that was people . 
we didn't seem to be going in and taking anything out of the country other than just it's labor , 
because everything that t i did anyway we shipped in 
and it was worked on down there , assembled , and then sent back here , 
did that have , 
i didn't feel that we really exploiting them any . 
um , so , that we were , um , exploiting in the sense of we were benefiting 
and they weren't . 
no , uh , 
in the particular incidence that i was aware of ,  now  t i wasn't the only ones in there , 
playtex was in , 
there was , uh , several other companies , 
and , uh , of course , we kind of concentrate on    , 
there wasn't much to take out of the country 
  i felt like we're going in and taken all um , their gold or oil ,
because , uh , it just , 
the only thing that they had a great abundance of was , uh , you know , human beings 
and , uh , 
like sometimes when americans go into foreign countries they tend to flaunt american things , americanism , um , consumer products , t v , the whole works . 
i understand what you say . 
there was a , uh , 
the time that i was down there , i stayed quite uh , uh , one of the big hotels  san  salvador . 
and at the time i thought there ought to be a law against american tourists . because they , for the most part , tend to be the most obnoxious as a group , 
and i saw this in panama also , 
uh , oh , you know , uh , the almost stereotype , you know , 
flowery shirt , shorts , camera hanging around their neck , you know , demanding  this , that and the other  thing , you know , 
we're here , 
and we want this , 
and we want that , 
and that sort of thing , 
that's the stereotype that's very strong down there , you know , 
you know , that sort of thing , 
i believe those of us who were working down there , got a little bit more appreciation for , you know , the local , uh , culture   
i really don't believe that we were quite that bad , 
but yet they were having to deal directly uh , the local people . 
uh , uh , you know , the old brash or ugly americantype ,
those are not americans 
they can't be . 
but there are 
and , uh , of course , now i remember one case where we had some canadians in there who were every bit as bad , 
but i mean , i think it's just kind of the north american situation   .
in panama they've been used to americans down there for so darn long 
but i didn't see quite as much of that sort of thing , as panamanians are just about uh , as   as americans , as far as , uh , creature comforts , you know , 
they're every bit , uh , 
my son was in the air force 
and he was stationed in panama , 
and he married a panamanian girl , 
and when she came up here , uh , you know , 
except for the language situation , some of the  cultures  she's just about an american ,
matter of fact if anything , she's worse . 
 but , uh , uh , there's little  enclaves  down there where , you know , americans  have  a lot of influence 
and the local population kind of , um , you know , sort of accepts that , 
but i've also seen the other side of it , too . 
well , you were in peru ? 
but , um , or at least i wasn't aware of that many americans there except for a very heavy concentration of peace corps volunteers , 
this was when the peace corps first are started , 
and it was one of the big targets 
and , um , that we were very controlled regarding number of days off 
and i was working actually in the savings and loan program , 
so , that was quite specialized , 
although i was living in the slums , i was really working with the middle class . 
uh , what area  did  you live in ? 
i was up in  arequipa  .
 oh , okay  
and , um  , 
i've heard of it . 
well , is peace corps still active down in there ? 
i don't have any idea , um , 
i mean , peru thirteen , which meant there were twelve groups before mine ,
and some of them were quite big in the sense they were community development , 
and they were building schools and doing coops and things like that , 
health , um , inoculation and things . 
oh , has those influences lasted   
do you know whether did those live on 
or were they reabsorbed 
or how , 
because , um , the peace corps , uh , that i knew of , did marry peruvians ,
and every now and then some news filters in that they went to see some of the old things , 
and of course , the savings and loan program , um , that just continued to grow . 
in fact , after my group , 
i mean , we were just a very small specialized group , too , to get that going and spread 
and then , of course , peace corps bowed out of that because that's , uh , uh , something that nationalized very quickly . 
and the same with the coops . 
well , the aim wasn't it , to get it started and then have it ,
oh , okay , 
 so , you know , well , that's , 
i had wondered sometimes , 
i knew that there was a lot of effort 
and a lot of work went into a lot of that , 
and i just wondered if it lasted , and if it took , you know , 
you know , some of the programs i would have concern about like , um , the language teaching , you know , 
i mean , why should we push english , 
and a lot of people were down there teaching english 
and when they talked about hungary or someplace , one of the eastern  law  countries requesting peace corps to teach language , you know , to me that's a little bit marginal . 
i did teach economics at the university one night a week , 
and the textbook was in english , 
but basically i taught it in spanish ,
my brotherinlaw teaches at , uh , northern illinois university 
and they were in china , here a couple of years ago , 
and he was over there at , uh , the university of  shah  and teaching  . . . 
so , uh , describe your family budget . 
well , i've pretty much flied without one , 
and , uh , just recently , uh , we set up a budget , 
and we're trying to stick to it . 
we just bought a new house . 
so uh , our fixed expenses are per month , 
and then we've got some ones that are variable , that pretty much stay within a certain range , 
uh , then there's the ones that you never know anything about , 
and that's the food 
well , yeah , 
and to some extent , utilities , i imagine . 
well , the utilities are pretty much , 
you can pretty much figure what they're going to be , 
and one of the nice things here is the electric company has a plan where they'll average them out for you . 
they have that to some extent here , 
but it's not quite as good . 
and , uh , transportation expenses , 
i guess you own a car . 
and you know how much you're going to drive every week ? 
well , i lived , uh , nine tenths of a mile from work . 
so , it was , you know , two miles a day to and from work . 
so it kind of cut my transportation costs a lot . 
but now i've just bought a new house , 
and i'm a half hour , 
and so my transportation costs have gone up by , uh , five times .
i understand that . 
we have a real similar situation . 
ours , uh , have quintupled , at least . 
so there is a real family budget . 
pretty much , um . 
the problem is there never seems to be enough money . 
i have three children , 
and it seems like the more money you make , the more money you have , the more things that they seem to need , 
and , uh , of course , nothing ever goes down , 
i mean , uh , i remember , 
i have five children total . 
i have three left in the house . 
and i can remember years ago , when school would start , 
and i'd go buy all five kids , you know , shoes , 
and i could get out of the shoe store without spending more than thirtyfive dollars . 
nowadays , thirtyfive dollars buys about one pair of shoes 
if you're lucky . 
so i mean things have just really gone out of sight in uh , i guess about the last ten years . 
i'm exempt . 
must be nice . 
part of the high price spread . uh , 
well , we do , 
but we don't have a family budget . 
we have the fixed things we have to pay . 
and we have the things that are extras . 
but it seems that by and large the extras just don't exist . 
and , well , you know , the auto budget , 
car payment sucks a hell of a lot of it dry . 
and insurance , 
is insurance bad there ? 
um , i've got , uh , two older cars . 
there both , 
one's a seventyseven 
and one's a seventyeight . 
well , we've got one eightynine . 
and my insurance it was running about four hundred dollars a year . 
but when i moved to the new town i live in , 
because it's a different county , which has less crime , and , uh , you know , less highways 
and so it's a cheaper place to live , as far as the insurance company's concerned , 
so i think my insurance dropped about sixty dollars a year . 
that's not bad , 
four hundred and something a year . 
it's actually three hundred and forty for each one of the cars . 
that's cheaper than we pay . 
i was down in texas for two years , 
and i was paying unbelievable rates for both car insurance and for home insurance . um , 
well , here in colorado it's even worse because we have no fault . 
do you have that there ? 
they have no fault in maryland also . 
well , no fault's rather funny in colorado , because it seems that everyone pays all the time 
it's kind of strange here the way things go . uh , 
here if you have an accident and no one's injured , the police won't even show up . 
you're kidding . 
well , if you , 
i don't know how familiar you are with maryland , 
but , uh , 
not at all . 
especially , the center part of maryland where i ninetyfive runs through it is really heavily populated . 
there's just so many people and so many accidents every single day that it'd take a whole another police force just to answer the traffic . 
they don't even try to keep up with it . 
so you lived in texas for a while . 
i spent , uh , couple of years down there . 
moved down there in eightyseven 
and moved out in eightynine . 
where you from originally . 
uh , right here in maryland . 
so you just basically went home when you had a chance . 
my family , uh , didn't like texas , 
and i had a chance to , uh , transfer up . 
t i bought a company about seven months after i moved to texas , right here in   .
that's nice . 
so i got an opportunity to transfer back , 
and i took it . 
that's great . 
uh , i'm a native texan . 
west texan . 
there is a difference . 
believe me , 
i know there is . 
i lived in plano , 
and i don't know if you're familiar with plano 
 but maybe five percent of the plano actually were from texas . 
everybody else was an import . 
well , i'm a west texan . 
lubbock , midland odessa 
a different world from down there . 
so , uh , colorado's been fun . 
but they have a real problem . 
next to every window the state seems to have put up a turnstile . 
and every time you look at the mountains 
or so it seems . 
i may just be paranoid , 
but that state income tax is just eating me alive . 
they have a state income tax in maryland . 
but i noticed when i was in texas , they didn't have a state income tax , 
but they sure nailed you on those darn county taxes and ,
oh my god , 
ate you alive . 
well , colorado , you know they have the state income tax , 
but then they also have property taxes , 
and they also have sales taxes , 
and they just get you every direction they can . 
and i just don't know , sir , 
but it seems like they trying to get you every which way . 
it sure does . um , 
there's , uh , some good books that i've read , um , that you might be interested in . uh 
oh yeah ? 
charles d . gibbons is the guy who runs some ads on light night t v 
and he's got seminars you can go to , 
and they try to hook you into his organization , which costs about four hundred bucks . 
but he's got a couple of books out . 
one of them is called , uh , wealth without risk . 
i've heard of the book . 
it's a very good book . 
it's tells you how to cut money on your taxes and on your insurance and then 
legally ,
legally cut money on your taxes , and on your insurance , 
and then he tells you how to invest that money in order to , uh , you know , be wealthier . uh , 
he also has a new book out that i purchased right before i moved and haven't had a chance to crack it open yet . um , 
financial self defense is the name of it . uh , 
the man , uh , has a lot of good ideas , 
some of them i already knew about , 
some of them i had already practiced . 
but i suggest it to anyone who wants to be better off financially to read it because , uh , 
and that includes everyone at t i . 
well , even , you know , the nonexempts , technically yet we haven't had our salary frozen yet . 
yet . 
but when you're only at living wage it doesn't matter . 
you know , survival is a funny state . 
i know what you mean . 
uh , when i was in dallas i was supervisor , 
and i had four non exempts , um , under me . 
and , uh , i was appalled at how they were paying them . 
i just couldn't believe it . 
 well , i've been with the company for sixteen years now . 
i was a w f for several years , 
and it just never seems to improve . 
and it doesn't seem to get much better for the exempts either , unless you're twentyeight or above . 
it's really a shame . 
well , this company that they bought , they ended up buying a very high payroll . 
and , uh , you know , i thought i was making a good wage , 
so , how do you feel about the metric system ? 
 oh , i like it . 
actually i have more than one foreign automobile . 
and the nondecimal system with all the halves and quarters , 
i was trying to build a shed 
and they give you these measurements like fortytwo and three eighths inches 
and we had to go a little less and trying to figure what's less than three eighths , uh  . . . 
and it's , 
i forget how many millimeters . 
so you used the metric ? 
well , no . 
and you just go down 
so many inches 
and we just marked a little bit less than that , uh , which is somewhat awkward 
but had it been millimeters , you could have done . 
i think what's interesting , 
the way engineering people do is they , 
they , in essence , have gotten around it by listing , uh , decimal inches . 
uh , yeah , 
are you involved in any engineering drawing stuff that ? .
uh , yeah , 
and tenths of inches are normal . 
and , you know , in tenths , hundredths , thousandths , ten thousandths , of an inch . 
well , are you involved in any other , uh , metric type things like  . . . 
i have a suzuki motorcycle 
and i've had motorcycles , japanese motorcycles for years and years 
and the metric system comes easy to me . 
 but my  . . . 
i think it's interesting you go out there 
and you're looking for a wrench 
and you want the next size larger . 
some stuff like fifteen thirty seconds . 
well , now that one's fairly easy , because that's probably slightly under half an inch . 
but some of them , like , twentyseven 
that , uh , don't translate . 
to go from eighths to sixteenths to , uh , thirty seconds and remember where it falls , it  . . . 
and you've got to go over there and try it 
i need a smaller one . 
i think the other thing that's interesting is that a lot of our stuff is already changed that we haven't , 
i don't know , 
do you drink adult beverages ? 
um , a lot of  . . . 
whiskey is in liters . 
and the next , 
point seven five liters and then liters and then one point seven five liters , 
 like fifths of whiskey i thought was always kind of strange . 
what's a fifth of whiskey ? .
i always wondered about that myself . 
it was a marketing ploy . 
and they had quarts at the same time though . 
but the idea was , is that uh , they could sell five 
to get people , you know 
uh , i find that interesting . 
it's  . . . 
but it's like , you know , the soda and this kind of things coming in 
and , um , i think it's kind of generational . 
 like i say , i work in a machine shop 
and , uh , everything's still inches . 
everything's still fractions of inches , or tenths 
it's hard to think 
it is a mental thing . 
it is a conversion thing . 
it's like a mill , you know . 
bond wire on 
and well , what's a mill 
and  . . . 
but what really annoys me is the way we , in the united states , have been converting to metric . 
we have a eightynine chevy blazer . 
and before that we had a horizon . uh , you know , plymouth horizon ? 
and both of them were a mismatch of both american and metric . 
don't you find that interesting ? uh , that they're doing that , uh , in any field , 
why pieces , 
could you get any connection on which was metric and which wasn't . 
uh , okay . 
the engine itself was mostly metric because it came from canada . 
oh , okay . 
and the starter was bosch american , 
the bolts were english then . 
it was annoying . 
you know , three bolts on the starter 
and two of them were american 
and one of them was metric . 
now that's strange . 
and , uh , you go from the , uh , water pump up to the radiator 
and on the water pump , it was all metric . 
and on , you know , the factory fittings , you know , the factory , uh 
essentially they do that though 
because if you look at general motors , the size 
and of course , ford and chrysler . 
if they all went metric , 
but in a sense , um , you know , it's like when you're milling something , uh 
or you got your calipers there 
and you measure , you know , 
you mic it to see if it's accurate 
it's not a problem either way . 
like i said , my only complaint is where they mixed them on the same car . 
and you go to look at it 
and you don't know which set to reach in , american or metric . 
and , you're never quite sure , 
well , is that a metric bolt . 
and you beat on it 
and a metric hammer .
it can be annoying 
and my other is the american government going to force us to go . 
oh , i don't think so . 
if it , 
because uh , um , like sports , you know . 
it's a hundred meter . 
oh , absolutely . 
uh , uh , but automobile races 
if it , 
i don't think they'd ever , 
it's still going to be the indianapolis five hundred . 
they're not going to  . . . 
it will always be . 
i don't think it's particularly bothersome because in reality , uh , 
it's like troy ounces in ounces of gold . 
how many ounces of gold , you know . 
i was trying to figure up gold content on something . 
it has , uh , gold plated , uh , header . 
and they're trying to think of what's a troy ounce . 
there's twelve troy ounces to the pound . 
now that makes , you know . 
and is that going to change too ? 
well , i mean , and then there's a metric ton 
and then there's a ton . 
but what's a metric ton ? 
uh , se , 
i don't know . 
i don't remember . 
i read it . 
and are we still going to maintain drams for perfume ? 
and some of these other things 
and the chemistry in those kinds of areas , 
it's all metric all ready . 
and what will a shot be ? 
will a shot be an ounce ? 
i don't know . 
and this one's , uh , uh , three pounds , um , 
 and you  . . . 
 and the other one's two point one kis , 
you're lost . 
that's right . 
and i don't know . 
i think the federal government is going to , more or less , leave it alone . 
i think there are more pressing problems . 
oh , yeah . 
the economy . 
uh , what i was thinking about is an economical issue concerning it . uh , 
a machinist has a huge number of dollars invested in tooling . 
personal tools to be able to do his job . 
are the tools that , uh , 
if you're cutting , 
uh , tools for set up and for measurement . 
uh , you got to have a one tenth indicator , 
it's a hundred dollars . uh , 
uh , usually two one tenth indicators 
five tenths indicator at about a hundred dollars . 
you got to have , uh , six inch set of calipers at anywhere from sixty to a hundred twenty dollars . 
you got to have a zero to one for sixty dollars . uh , 
one to two inch micrometer for sixty dollars . 
a two to three for eighty dollars . 
a three to four for eighty dollars . 
so you've got thousands of dollars or so . 
i mean you get a thousand dollars worth of tools . 
real fast . 
real , real fast . 
edge finders and  . . . 
but i was thinking about though that when you actually get to the milling equipment though , when it starts turning  . . . 
well , i know , 
because , okay . 
your end mills will be measured in inches or fractions of inches . 
you know . 
i need a hole there . 
what size hole ? 
as in metric size hole or an american sized hole ? 
but the thing is then you've got to with screws 
and that's the other issue . uh , 
the pitch and  . . . 
well and thread , 
uh , i don't go to the movies a whole lot , 
but , uh , i went two or three weeks ago for the first time in a long time and saw dances with wolves , which turned out to be an extremely good movie . 
i haven't seen that yet . 
i hear , 
a whole bunch of us were going to go see it . 
it's playing at school actually in about two weeks , i guess . 
so we're going to go see that . 
but you enjoyed that ? 
my brother lives over in fort worth , 
and i was telling him about a couple of weeks ago , 
this is not one that you want to do that with . 
that's what i heard , 
uh , the scenery and the landscape and the country that they're in needs a big screen . 
it's just beautiful country with the hills and the trees and the buffalo and the whole thing , 
it's uh , just amazing , amazing picture . 
i've heard it's not one for the videos . 
it's one i think , 
this is my favorite movie . 
well , this is the one for me this time . 
what have you been to lately ? 
um , let's see . 
well , uh , this is almost , sort of funny . 
i was just sit , um , 
friend and i went to see out for justice 
oh , yeah . 
so we wanted to see what this is like . 
and , uh ,   impressed with actually . 
is that right ? 
and i just think he's pretty good . 
but , uh , this movie , 
i'm convinced now he can act . 
how's his karate ? 
oh , his karate is pretty good . 
i think in this one it wasn't so good . 
i generally , um , 
movies like that scare me , though . 
i'd be just fine without them , because , you know , kids come running out wanting to beat each other up . 
well they do , 
they get 
 well i remember when grand prix came out when i was a kid , and some other movies like that . 
we wanted to jump in the cars and race . 
and i suspect today what they see is bound to be what they want to do when they get out of it . 
well , that was number one for the week actually , too , 
 so it was a little bit , uh , 
people must be into crime movies again . 
um , an interesting point . 
last year's number one movie for the year was ghosts . 
is that right ? 
i don't know if you saw ghosts or not . 
at least , if everyone's running around seeing karate movies and stuff like that , at least they're still going to see the real good movies , you know . 
i think that ghosts was one of those that a lot of people didn't think was going to be any good . 
and it turned out to be an excellent movie . 
i was absolutely enthralled by it . 
i've forgotten the guy's name who was in it , who had the lead role . 
oh , patrick swayze ? 
he's very good . 
he's a really good guy . 
other than that , dances with wolves seems like to be the only thing i've seen in the past several months to have any , 
i'm trying to think what else i've seen recently . 
what else have we seen recently . 
oh , you know , what's pretty cute actually . um , 
defending your life . 
is that right . 
have you heard of it ? 
but i'm not real sure what it's about . 
yeah , um , 
i actually hadn't heard anything about it , 
and they said it starred , um , meryl streep and mel brooks , 
at first they told me . 
mel brooks and meryl streep . 
that is a strange combination . 
well , actually , it's actually albert brooks , 
so it's lot better . 
mel brooks you probably know . 
i know , 
so it was a strange combination . 
but it turned out to be a very cute movie . 
i mean , the whole premise is that they go out 
and they die 
oh , yeah . 
 and they have to , 
both of them . 
both of them are dead , 
and they happen to meet in this sort of city where you're set up . 
you know , they go 
and they decide if you can move up to the next level . 
i don't know if you've ever read jonathan livingston seagull , 
they sort of move up to levels , 
and they have to decide whether or not they're good enough , 
and as it turns out , you know , they meet there and fall in love and stuff like that . 
so you can guess the rest of the plot . 
you know , what they have them do is sit down and see scenes of their lives . 
oh , yeah . 
and then defend it . 
and that's pretty good actually . 
well , i guess that's where the title comes from then . 
you actually have to go up there 
and you know , attorney for you and attorney , 
a defense and a prosecution , 
and you know , the prosecutor's job is to make sure you don't move up a level , 
and the defense's job is to make sure that you do , you know . 
uh , it's a neat little story actually . 
it is . 
it's funny , 
we've got a couple of movies out recently , ghosts and defending your life , that have to do with , uh , after life , i guess . 
and it kind of makes you wonder , 
besides working at t i , i'm a graduate student at north texas and working on master's in communication . 
it's the behavioral science part of communication , 
and i think about these things and people trying to define their own world view , 
and , uh 
or why are we so fascinated with the other world . 
is it supposed to be better ? 
the other world , 
sometimes i think we think it is . 
we like those things that way . 
um , i'm sure that it seems like , 
it certainly would explain the preoccupation with    , 
but i suspect it's always been a preoccupation with that sort of things . 
well , it has . 
all the way through history , there's , i guess , 
if you want to call its mysticism or the occult or whatever . it's always fascinated . 
i guess because we don't know , 
and there's no real way of finding out . 
there's only one way of finding it . 
well did you ever see , um , flatliners . 
the girl next to me saw it , 
and she really liked it . 
that's probably one of those ones that , you know , 
it's on video now , i think . 
it is . 
probably worth seeing on video . 
actually we really enjoyed it , 
but it was also right along the same lines . 
i mean 
she said that this was almost believable 
that could really happen . 
you know , you get the medical profession doing these kinds of things , 
and you never know . 
it's a little far fetched to ,
and they didn't just sort of make it silly . 
you know , it was done fairly well , i think . 
so . actually , i actually enjoyed that as well . 
i like it when they will do something and not get too silly . 
i've been disappointed in some movies that , they don't know how to end it , it seems like , 
so then they get crazy 
and it doesn't end like the story has been going . 
the story sort of keeps going and going . 
well , it was , nice talking to you . 
um , i think that there is something definitely wrong with our school system just because of the results that you see coming out of the school system ,
you know something must be wrong as far as , uh , not just the teaching techniques but just motivation ,
excuse me just a minute ,
i'm on the other line karen . 
i'm sorry . 
oh , it's okay . 
okay . 
uh , she , uh , 
well the results , 
you're saying about the results . 
 and , uh , the big thing . 
my wife teaches school here in plano . 
and , i know that , uh , the results that they get out of the system sometime is certainly not  , you know , up to what the effort they put into it , you know , 
i've seen that for years , 
and , i know , uh , 
i work around , you know a lot of teachers 
and i understand how , uh , supportive they are of their students and how excited they are , 
but some how , i don't think the students are getting excited . 
i've often wondered if it doesn't come back to the home environment . 
oh , yes 
and , uh , the classroom , if they go home at night and , you know , it's all totally undone , uh . 
has run into so often is that you run into a group of kids that are going to succeed no matter what , no matter how bad their teachers are ,
these people somehow manage to , uh , you know , 
it's , uh , unfortunately probably maybe twentyfive or thirty percent of them do that . 
not even that much probably . 
well , be at the absolute most . 
and , uh , you know , are real trouble , 
uh , uh , a part of the system , you know , 
you know , in a democracy where , you know , people have kind of , uh , a freedom to sort of do what they want ,
and you've got to let you know , those , 
and speaking of doing what you want , uh , just in society today being that it's nineteen ninetyone ,
oh , oh yeah . 
you start dating too early , you know , 
just little things like that , that do start in the home , 
that plays a big part because you spend eight hours of your day , or more in school 
and so any other part of your life , that's going to definitely affect your school life ,
and sometimes in some systems they make everything so competitive , you know , 
your competing against somebody else 
or your competing against , uh , a system or something ,
and then , a lot of the , 
there is a personality type i believe that is really noncompetitive . 
they're cooperative rather than competitive , 
i talked to , a guy the other day 
and he is now he fell back several years ago 
and he will have gone to school five years . 
um , and the reason that he was doing so badly a couple of years ago was because his mother died , 
and he was having to , uh , support his entire family , take care of his brothers and sisters , you know , 
and all that had an adverse affect on his school life . 
i would think so , 
and , yeah , 
and that's a perfect example of how your home life , you know , plays a definite part . 
and , you know , 
now , that he's in this program and , you know , he's , i guess okay , 
he's making straight a s , 
and , you know , i guess school was not a number one priority for him at that time . 
it , uh , 
survival becomes more of a priority than education , 
and unfortunately , you know , uh , there's and old joke about , uh , you know , 
education's wasted on the youth anyway . 
you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway . 
and i've got better things to be doing than sitting here listening to this stuff over and over again . 
i guess today uh , some how or other there would be a program of some sort that would take care of that sort of thing , 
that sort of make sense , 
uh , most teachers after they have taught for a very long , especially at the lower grades can spot a problem almost immediately . 
and , uh , it's kind of these intervention programs . 
and that's , you know , 
and then it gets political . 
but , uh , boy . 
when people start talking about programs that help , for me , i don't care if it's socialist , 
or i don't care ,
i mean , that's the point i'm at now . 
i mean that's the point we all should be at , is like finding some solution , 
um , yeah . 
i mean , you know , nothing totally radical , 
but if it's something that , you know , might help , you know , 
because there's not a lot being done . 
well , you know , the radical programs in some cases are just totally unacceptable . 
there are kids , families , that should just simply be taken out of the homes , you know . 
or they're never going to get anywhere . 
but yet , politically that is not a very popular view . 
take them out . 
you know how far you're going to get with that . 
not very far at all . 
uh , but unfortunately are spotted fairly early on , 
and , uh , you know , well that's get to be a problem in texas , you know , 
i mean it's almost like , 
you got counselors and all that . 
but you know , you can counsel a kid eight hours a day 
and then he goes home 
or something like that , 
or they don't care . 
an a lot of the parents now are so young . 
you know , they still don't know what's going on 
and how are they supposed to , you know , teach their kids that are coming up , you know , what's going on . 
i mean it's a vicious cycle ,
and we have to try to swim out . 
you know , kind of like the bermuda triangle , 
we're just sinking 
and it's almost impossible to swim back up . 
but , um , yeah , 
there's definitely problems , 
its just the solutions you know , they're going to be in our political system , 
they're going to be on everyone's mind for quite a while , too long . 
i don't know if you've ever had too much to do with , uh , oh , especially asian , japanese families coming , 
here in plano we've got , uh , quite a few . 
uh , engineering types , people who have come from japan , 
and they put their kids in the u s schools 
and they're appalled . 
you know , not so much at what the schools are teaching , but what they let the kids get away with . 
um , uhhuh . 
you know , they see most , uh , 
uh , the disruptive influence of school . 
and in japan they would be , you know . 
 but , uh , here again , you get back into a political thing , where , uh , 
 there's definitely too much leeway as far as , 
i mean , i've been out of college only two years , 
and you were saying that you don't appreciate education until you get out 
and i really don't see myself going back to school or anything , 
but , i appreciate more what i had . 
and i had all these classes and all this knowledge and this big library across the street from my dorm , 
were you at baylor ? 
and i just didn't take as much advantage of it as i should have . 
did you go to baylor ? 
oh , oh , okay . 
i'm , uh , 
so , i mean all kinds of resources and , you know , just there , 
and i'd give anything to have that right now in my regular li , 
i mean you have everything given to you . 
i don't see why people wouldn't want that . 
i don't know , 
but then , if i was young , i wouldn't see it . 
well that's it 
 but you know , now that it's gone , i , 
i graduated from texas tech ,
and , you know , i kind of look back at it sometimes , 
well that was a lot of fun , 
but , we , 
i did a lot 
and i experienced a lot 
and i feel like i got a good college education 
but just when i got out i feel like i should have spent more time in the library , 
i should have taken those continuing educations classes or whatever they were , you know , 
the informal classes that you don't get credit for , you know  . . . 
i guess we're in the process of a home repair right at this point 
because we're painting the outside of our house . 
i don't know , 
i guess you would consider that a home repair . 
certainly , uh , uh , 
and interesting enough , this time we're changing the color which makes it an addition . 
what is your most recent , 
we just   did that , too . 
does it make a big difference ? 
oh , yes 
and the colors that we painted changed the entire look of the house . 
it was fun . 
i was really , really tired of the color . 
it's helping . 
we're not quite through , 
but it really is looking good . 
uh , we went through a process on a rental house we had , 
probably the most extensive and , uh , the interesting part of it was how much we learned about what we could do . 
um , we didn't have very much money 
and so we had to do it ourselves in kind of a slow process , 
but we learned how to uh , retile bathtubs and , uh , oh , just all kinds of things that are unusual . 
so the other thing that we did was the roof of our house . 
and , uh , we did that a different color also . 
of course , uh , being a woman most of these things were done by the men . 
uh , so i wasn't directly involved 
but , uh , they really were helpful , i know , to our house . 
that's awful . 
um ,  howard  and i were talking about home repair the other night uh , in connection with scouting . 
we've got a scout coming up 
and , uh , uh , i think it's neat for young people to learn how to , uh , take care dripping faucets , 
as a matter of fact , i have a young son 
and one thing we did , was we had paneling on uh , front of our house , or the hall way of our house , rather , 
and we were repainting the front room in the hall there , 
and we took down that paneling 
and he helped me 
it was fun to work with him .
how does the paneling , 
it looks lots better than , 
do you like it better ? 
it makes it so much lighter . 
you know , it really does . 
you know , and people that have been to my house before and then now really have liked ,
that's nice . 
it's been fun . 
nice to have it come out positive and look , 
well , we have a lot that needs be done . 
we have , uh , uh , carpeting , 
and we did have a new , uh , floor put in our kitchen . 
and , um , i have my mother living with us 
and so she was in a room with a carpet 
and , of course , she's quite aged , 
she's ninetythree now , 
so that meant she had problems now and then 
and it was really good to get the carpet out of there and put a linoleum down . 
so it was easier to clean and see where the dirt was 
and  ,
it was fairly expensive though . 
i was impressed , 
i think , that , uh , 
we had somebody do it 
and it seems to me like it's probably more expensive to put down linoleum almost than it is to put down carpet . 
kind of depends on the quality of carpet , i suppose , 
 but , uh , in the case of the linoleum they have to rip up everything and fix the floor 
so it's , uh , 
i don't know , 
what ever , 
but they have to put stuff on the floor 
and it's , uh , kind of a process . 
well , it sounds like you have some pretty good experiences uh , with , uh , uh , home repair . 
we have . 
it's been really fun . 
all right . 
happy home repairing . 
you too .
what do you do with your credit cards ? 
well , my husband and i have gotten into some problems with credit cards . 
we don't handle them very well .
we tend to run them up to the maximum and then ask for more . 
oh , jeez . 
they're really bad for us . 
um , matter of fact , we've gotten rid of all of our credit cards except for a mastercard and a visa , 
and we pretty much keep those maxed out . 
oh , i was going to say that , that sounds like pretty many . 
but i see what you meant , 
you had them for each of the individual stores . 
i had probably twenty credit cards 
i had an american express , american express gold , an optima , all the different department stores , um , two visas , two mastercards .
oh , gee . 
i mean , i had , 
any time anybody would , you know , send me an application , you know , preapproved or whatever , i took it , 
and it really ended up getting us in some real serious trouble . 
oh , sure . 
um , because , see , the more credit cards you have , the more people offer them to you . 
and the more you use them , the more they send them to you . 
the american express was probably the worst , um , because with the gold card , 
i can't remember how much it was because i didn't even have it very long before i gave it up 
 but i know the green card was like thirtyfive , forty five dollars a year . 
forty five . 
right , uh , 
which was a lot , 
because i mean , you had to pay it in full every month . 
exactly , you know , 
that's it , 
i really resented the fact that they were charging me for cards , 
so i sent back all of mine , except the ones that were free . 
and , um , then i also limited it to one of each , one mastercard and one visa , 
and here , most of the stores will accept those , 
and actually i then got a discover card since they pay you back . 
i had a discover , 
and that was one of the ones in the group that i ended up , um , closing . 
um , it really wasn't my choice , though . 
i mean , i ended up actually losing my credit cards . 
um , i ended up going through a credit counseling service 
 and , um , once you start with their service , they close your accounts out . 
oh , i see . 
so , i'm still paying on all these accounts , 
but my accounts are closed . 
and i would prefer to keep it that way . 
once we're paid off 
and that's it . 
actually i pay off my cards every month . 
only once in my life have i not paid . 
i think that's a really good way to handle it , because that way , if you paid off every month , you never have to worry about , well , how much do i have to pay these guys , you know , this month , you know . 
you buy what you can afford . 
i mean 
well , and also in a sense , they're giving you a loan for a month 
so that 
but yeah , 
to the price of what i buy ,
and i , 
um , i'm glad that we're starting to pay our debts off , now , um , you know , 
only we started this last year 
 and we probably still have about another year to go 
but i think they way the whole economy is going right now , it's just not good to be in debt . 
that's right , 
that would be a very scary feeling for me to know that i was , you know , juggling payments to different people 
and it's not , because you know , i'm rich or anything , 
it's just , a mental concept that i have .
that i just . 
well , when you're getting rid of the whole credit card cycle , and if you really get into the mind set , i got really good at juggling money and basically robbing peter to pay paul , 
and it was scary , because i was so good at it . 
i mean , this has got to stop , because eventually it'd end up catching up with me 
and it hit me in the face . 
but it sounds like , you know , you learned from it 
and you're coming out of it all right . 
i have , 
i've learned a lot from it . 
i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand 
i don't think that , 
well , when we buy on credit we just don't have a concept of how much money we're spending 
and then all of a sudden you look at the bill 
i spent this much . 
but now , the fact that you still have two cards , 
do you use them , more judiciously ? 
 and that paid for a new transmission 
 um , and things like that . 
um , and we try not to use them for 
clothing , sales . 
sales i find are a pain . 
from credit cards , 
and i pay by check a lot more now . 
well , it sounds good , you know . 
like i said , it sounds like you've really got it under control . 
not even getting , you know , past the thirty days , 
where i would like to be . 
and like i said , it happened i couldn't because my son's tuition came due , 
and i guess i had , you know , not really counted on it quite at that point 
 but , um , yeah , 
i didn't like it at all . 
i was very uncomfortable . 
i can imagine . 
you know , and i mean , it was , i thought a lot , 
sixty dollars interest or something for just a couple of months , 
but in , you know , retrospect it wasn't all that much , 
i mean a lot of people pay a lot more 
oh , yeah . 
think about what you can buy for sixty dollars . 
groceries for a week . 
yeah . 
that we've spent on interest 
and it's just incredible . 
but now did you use to not feel so badly because you could take it off your income tax ? 
i'm fairly newly married . 
i've only been married less than two years 
 and before that , i never owned a home or anything , 
so i never had any deductions . 
so , really , it was always just money 
thrown away . 
and i never really thought about it because , 
you were good at it .
i was so good at it that it just kind of got stuck in the back of my mind and just never 
i suspect that , you know , thinking about it and looking at my friends and the number of credit cards that they use and , you know , the amount that i know they buy , i guess probably a lot of them are in a similar situation , and , you know , just don't talk about it . 
most people don't like to talk about money . 
they feel uncomfortable , i think . 
you know , 
very personal . 
and especially if you don't feel you're handling it quite right 
but i think not including like a mortgage . 
a mortgage is an understandable debt 
and i would much rather own my own home than be renting it like we're doing . 
i mean , we're basically , you know , kind of throwing seven hundred dollars a month away . 
we're renting a house . 
but , you know , right now with the way our credit card situation is , there's nobody in the world that's going to give us a mortgage on a house . 
you prove yourself by paying this off next year 
it's going to take quite a while . 
hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home . 
but , um , i'm not really counting on it real soon . 
you want to get a start ? 
uh , the weather here is warm . 
and it has been sort of raining on and off . 
and , uh , i am an avid gardener 
so i on a regular basis . 
oh , great , 
uh , but it has been threatening to rain for the last couple of days , 
and it has not ,
how about pennsyl , 
growing summer starts a lot earlier than ours . 
see that is quite a bit , 
we are just beginning . 
people have got their gardens in , a lot of them now . 
we could still have a frost . 
this late ? 
could you have snow ? 
uh , probably not . 
oh , well , 
early june . 
we have also had nice weather . an unusually , uh , nice spring . 
it is almost like an early summer for us . 
oh , that is nice . 
we could use a little more rain ,
uh , well , 
usually we get it in great quantities in 
and then it stops for three months . 
if it could just be spread out a little bit . 
it has really been nice here , uh , 
we are supposed to have some rain this weekend , 
but i don't know if we'll get it or not . 
a lot of times in our area the weather forecast has missed us . 
the weather they forecast for our area seems to go right past us and misses us . just by , well not too many miles . 
are you in an agricultural area ? 
we have , 
well , i know the weather is very important for people who make their living off of , 
we have quite a few farmers . 
we live out in the country . 
we are on a farm , 
but we are not a farming 
uh , we have a garden . 
uh , but we are not farmers . 
well , you know there are some disadvantages to being down south . 
and that is , it gets so hot that , you know , a lot of things die during the summer from the heat . 
oh , yeah . 
they get burnt off . 
they really do , 
and you have to be very careful to make sure you keep everything watered . 
well , and that makes it bad too , with water being at a premium . 
i know our aunt in california , 
they have really been rationed on their water . 
and it makes it real hard to have a yard their garden , their farms . 
their farmers , i guess , are hurting because of that also . 
well , my parents are now in san diego , 
and they've got pebbles in their yard because they can't , 
well , they are not allowed to water , 
so what do you do ? 
yeah . 
uh , it is very rough on them 
 actually i think it is pretty moderate here in dallas . 
because the summers are extremely hot . 
but your humidity is different though than ours i think , 
and it makes a bit of a difference , too . 
um , what is your humidity like ? 
oh , i don't know . 
i think our humidity is higher normally than what it is in texas . 
i could be wrong . 
uh , i do not know what it is percentage wise 
but i , 
i do not know for sure either . 
but well , it just felt different like when we were in texas . 
it had a different feel to it . 
it is drier in dallas than it is in houston or san antonio 
but it is not dry . 
and i have lived here for many years , 
and i think it has gotten more humid over the years . 
where the water is coming from , i don't know . 
well , it could be . 
i know my brother's home has been flooded a couple of times , uh , 
oh , does he live near the lake ? 
but it is more run off 
and , uh , he is just in an area where it is just low enough that it collects there . 
and , uh , he has had a couple of inches in his house several times . 
that is a problem , uh , 
they tell you when you are looking for a house or buying land to build on ,
because of that . 
and , uh , i know exactly what you mean . 
where we are we get flooded , it floods below us  ,
but we never , you know , have had any problem like that . 
oh , well , that is fortunate . 
it is an old farm house 
and , uh , we really like it here . 
well , i like it here . 
uh , i grew up here . 
i have lived other places 
and this is very much home for me . 
it is nice down there . 
i liked it when we visited there . 
i hope you visited during the winter . 
one of my theories is that you always go to warm places during the winter 
that is the best time to go . 
when we have gone , it has been nice . 
it has been hot , 
but it is hot to me in the wintertime down there . 
oh , sure . 
i mean  , 
you know .
but it is nice , 
it is really a nice area . 
i had a friend from england visit once at christmas , 
and we could not get her out of the what she called the back garden .
oh , really ? 
and she went back to the north of england with a sunburn .
oh , good heavens .
not me .
i avoid the sun .
well , yeah , 
basically i do , too . 
it takes me about four and a half hours to mow our grass . 
and i try to cover up .
well , that is really healthier , frankly . 
well , i have had a couple of problems 
and , uh , i decided it is not worth it . 
i like to get tan in the summer time because i think you look healthier . 
and , uh , we are just crazy .
but you know , it is interesting because you get out in that sun an awful lot . 
now my sister is a sun fiend . 
and , uh , she is five years younger than me , 
she is more wrinkled . 
is that right ? 
and i think that is why . 
i think it burns off the , 
i don't know the scientific principle . 
but it burns something off , the natural oils 
well , the elasticity of your skin , the collagen or whatever they call it . 
they say it destroys a lot of that . 
and you lose a lot of that . 
so , uh , 
uh , that sounds like the right theory . 
but we have really had nice , 
the weather , 
i can't complain . 
we have really had really good weather of late . 
and when it has rained , it's been a good soaking rain 
and , uh , it has just been a really nice spring . 
well , that is great . 
it has been very nice here too . 
and i hope it continues because my parents are coming to visit this evening 
and i want them to have 
oh , that is great . 
how long will they be there ? 
uh , probably four or five days . 
well , that is great . 
well , i hope the weather stays real good for them . and , 
well , thank you .
and i hope your garden does good . 
and the same to you . 
and , so . okay . 
well , it was really nice talking to you . 
a pleasure . 
and , uh , good luck in this venture . 
it is , uh , like i said , 
it has been real interesting . 
so i hope you enjoy it as much as i have been enjoying it .
i am sure i will . 
the out of town visitors , i probably would have been making some phone calls in the last couple 
i forget to . 
the day goes by , 
and i forget to make a call usually . 
well , i am glad you have broken the ice with me because now , i will start doing it .
well , thanks , jean . 
uh . byebye . 
is , uh , that a sport you like to participate in ? 
and i'm a second hand spectator as a result of or my late husband's , interest in golf . 
my husband likes golf also , 
uh , i guess he'd be a fanatic if he thought he could get away with it .
but he limits it pretty good . 
i , um , have tried to go out and play golf . 
he would love it if i would go out and play with him , 
and i can't even hit the ball .
i can't even play miniature golf well . 
i don't either .
 well , there are just some things that we're good at and other things that we're not , 
but i am very good at watching it on television . 
and he was really , uh , enthusiastic about keeping up with the tournaments . 
he could tell me exactly what day and what time of year and where the tournaments were going to be held , and what the nature of the hole was and , 
oh , so he's really into it . 
oh , yeah , 
he was a good golfer . 
and did some , you know , instructions at the country club for a while . 
but , uh , golf tended to be so , 
i am not really deeply involved in following any of the sports . 
but golf was one that i developed a working knowledge of a lot of the golfers , 
and therefore i enjoyed following those particular players . 
more because of their personalities 
another part of it was i'd pick one out that was different than what my husband was rooting for 
so  ,
and i became involved in following his career . 
and , uh , i know that my husband , 
tom kite was his fair haired boy . 
and he thought he was spectacular . 
i'm not going to stay interested in him . 
so i decided andy bean was good competition .
any time they both played , why , he was just real excited when tom was , you know , shown on the television , 
and i followed andy bean . 
we both followed lee trevino into the seniors . 
oh , he's interesting . 
he is . 
i like to watch him . 
he is a character 
but he's quite a character . 
and there are some really , really wonderful people in the game of golf who do give wonderful role models . 
i think you're right . 
and i think it's critical to have a good role model 
i like to watch those skins games . 
do you ever watch those where they just play for a certain amou , you know , 
for each hole they win they get the money 
i think those are pretty exciting . 
well , i myself , really have not seen a whole lot of point to the game of golf . 
you hit a little ball , 
you chase it , 
you go find it , 
and then you hit it again and lose it again . 
and i know the whole point is to get it in that little bitty hole , 
but seems to me like if they made the hole bigger it'd be easier . 
oh really .
i sometimes wonder why men like it so much because they get so frustrated 
oh , i know . 
oh , yeah . 
my husband and his buddies are not very good . 
they play like maybe once a month or less 
 and so they all hit like in the low nineties , 
and they think they're having a really good game .
oh , yeah . 
well , my husband's average ran in the mid seventies 
 so he wasn't bad . 
that is good . 
he was pretty good , 
but as far as influencing young people , i think that uh , that is one of the sports that you can carry into old age . 
you can't play football at fiftyfive . 
but it is a good healthy , wholesome lifestyle , uh , 
anything can be warped . 
but i think that that is one of the sports that's a good healthy way to move into maturity 
something to stay active at 
that's right , 
and a lot of elderly people don't even take up golf until they're , you know , in their later years . 
and they can still get good at it . 
that's right , 
and it's something that , 
well , maybe that's what i'll do when i have time later on , 
when you're too old to do anything else 
but it's also something that husband and wife can participate in 
 or , you can both enjoy the same sport and participate in separate circles . 
you know , you can go to the country club together . 
you can play with your friends , 
he can play with his friends , 
but you've both been out and exercised , 
and you have enjoyed the day . 
or my favorite , 
just ride around in the cart with him .
you bet , 
you get a lot of exercise that way . 
go somewhere really nice , like hawaii , and just 
well , i'll tell you what , if 
oh , yeah . 
but my husband's pretty tolerant , 
so he's not too bad 
oh , mine had a very short fuse . 
if he did something bad , he's liable to take that club and throw it as far as he can throw it . 
oh , no , 
he's replaced almost as many clubs as he has balls . 
i mean , just get so mad , he'd just wham that club up against a tree and break that rascal . 
now my husband has a temper , 
but he doesn't seem to show it on the golf course . 
because he'll talk about the other guys he plays with doing that 
so i guess he's real laid back about it . 
when he was shooting in the hundreds , 
and he'll tell me what a great day he had , and about this great shot he made and everything   .
well i shot in the hundreds , 
but i made this one good one .
this one , on this one hole .
it's hard for me to ,
well , one thing that is a drawback about it , i think , is the cost . 
membership in the clubs is expensive , 
the equipment is very expensive , 
requires special shoes , 
requires you know , special equipment . 
there's so many , 
and then they want to play another course they're not a member of 
that's right . 
and other fees . 
that's right , 
it really is high . 
it can get very expensive , 
and i can imagine what kind of costs are involved if you're going to try to go pro , because you spend hours and hours and hours 
oh , yeah . 
and they don't give those sessions away . 
and nor do they give , uh , instructions away . 
as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in golf . 
i'll have to try it and see . 
i've always watched it . 
if you do , then we can go golf together . 
oh , whoa , 
i get to walk all around a little green field all day . 
but those kinds of things happen , though , 
you get a little taste of it 
and you really begin to develop an interest in it . 
but i am not an athlete at all . 
me either . 
you know , i'm always the one that got hit by the bat in baseball ,
so i am not an athlete . 
maybe golf is a forgiving sport . 
i don't know . 
at least you're just com , 
it doesn't appear to be .
i haven't really acquired an interest in it , 
but i'm open to try anything ,
the one thing that is also detrimental as far i'm concerned , my skin is very fair 
 so i'm going to have to golf in the evening 
or i'm going to have to golf at a time when the heat of the day does not cook me . 
and i don't think the , 
have you participated in anything like that ? 
we mostly do our newspapers . 
and we keep our newspapers and stuff like that 
and we take them to be recycled . 
uh , we have a pretty nice recycling center , uh , in our city now 
and we take the newspapers and plastic and glass up there . 
they're open like two days a week 
and you can just take it up there and drop it off . 
it's kind of fun . 
and everybody up there looks pleased with themselves when they're taking their stuff in like they're doing something good to ,
 and a lot of people complain because it's really not convenient for them . 
my husband was complaining the other day 
you're supposed to what . 
every time he turns around i'm giving him some new rule ,
but what are you supposed to do with them . 
oh , okay . 
and i wish that our recycling center took paper bags . 
they won't take those . 
we like to just put our newspapers in a paper bag , you know , and then carry them up there that way . 
and we have to bring the paper bags back every time .
do you , uh , take your papers somewhere 
or does someone pick them up ? 
quite a bit 
and then we take them in . 
um , we don't take our cans up to that center , though , 
our aluminum cans , we like to take them to one of the places where they pay you for them . 
we don't , um , use aluminum cans , 
so , we generally don't have those to do . 
it takes us about a year to save up enough to be you know , worth bothering to go in and do , 
but . do you , um , have any ideas on anything that would make , 
you know , they charge you , you know , 
it's like a flat rate i think for picking up your garbage . 
and i know a lot of people it would solve the convenience problem if they had curbside pickup 
and some communities are trying to do that now . 
and i think that maybe if they only charged for the garbage that you did not sort and have set up for recycling , 
by weight of how much trash you were actually sending to a land fill . 
that would be a good idea . 
that might be a better way to do it . 
and then people would know that it was going to cost them money to not sort their trash . 
that would be a real good motivation for people . 
my father was telling me about some program he read about where like you buy your garbage bag from the city , 
and you pay more than just what you would pay for an empty garbage bag 
but then you don't pay any monthly fee or anything , 
so how ever many bags of garbage you throw away , that's how many you have to pay for . 
oh , yeah 
that's about the same kind of thing . 
that would be a real good idea . 
i'm trying to think if there's anything else i could think of . 
they are talking about going to curbside pickup in our city   .
where do you live ? 
rowlett , texas . 
oh , okay . 
do you know where that is ? 
and i don't know if they decided to do , or not , 
but i think they said it was going to add like either a dollar or three dollars a month to your bill to have them do that . 
although , i think a lot of those programs can operate at about a break even point ,
it seems like they would be able to . 
i don't know , uh , 
i guess it just depends on how they manage it . 
i don't know how much they get when they sell all that stuff . 
the center that they've got now where you take your stuff in i think that should be making some money .
and i guess they sell everything to some waste company that comes and gets it . 
but i wish that , uh , more of you know , like the cans you buy vegetables and fruit and stuff like that in were recyclable . 
i don't , 
a lot of that's that recyclable steel 
and i don't know anybody that takes that . 
that's true   .
my husband likes pepsi 
and those cans are steel instead of aluminum , 
so we can't ever recycle them . 
i think it's a good reason to quit buying it . 
 um , now i didn't know that , 
cause the two liter bottles . 
that's what we buy the most of , unless we're going on a trip or something where we want to ,
but , well that's all i can really think about for recycling . 
it was good talking to you . 
uh , bye . 
all right , 
oh , well people that call on the phone all the time to try to sell you something . you know , carpet cleaning , and , uh , what else , roof repair 
and enough , 
well i think it's a waste of paper , the people that always leave , uh , junk mail because , um , you just end up throwing it away most of the time . 
probably eighty percent of is , um , something that you don't need . 
and the same way with those calls . 
what is it , 
oh m c i really does . 
even when you tell them no , they keep calling back . 
m c i 
what's that ? 
m c i 
it's the long distance telephone company . 
oh , now see i just say no thank you and hang up . 
well they won't take a no for an answer here for some reason . 
they just keep calling back . 
i had a carpet service call up three times ,
but , uh , i do telemarketing , 
so , uh , i'm very polite 
and i hang up and ,
so i think the only thing that really bothers me is when somebody contacts me 
and they try to get information out of me . 
like the united states census bureau . 
oh yeah . 
that bothered me . 
i didn't feel they had a right to know how many bedrooms were in my house even . 
that i think is my invasion privacy because it's the government 
and i don't understand what their need to know is . 
and i think that is my biggest objection to anything as far as invading my privacy . if somebody wants personal information out of me , 
but telephone calls i figure , they don't bother me one way or the other . 
uh , i know when i do telemarketing , um , i'm a soft person , 
and i make very good sales , 
but uh , as i said , i'm not half as pushy as these people because , i don't really care . 
i mean , if they're not interested fine . 
you know that's it . 
 you can't force them to be . 
and i'm not pushing something down their throat that , uh , i don't think is a good item anyway . 
that i don't think i could do anyway . 
but i feel like , oh , movie stars , or 
sure , i guess they're  portray  being a movie star 
they get themselves in these rag sheets 
but , uh , i think they go too far . 
oh , yeah 
i think that's invasion of privacy . 
 because they follow them around twentyfour hours a day . 
and you know they do ted kennedy . 
oh , yeah . 
of course , he's breaking the law all the time , 
so it's a different story then . 
you know , i mean , you know , who cares about ed mcmahon . 
he's probably hasn't done anything interesting in the last thirty years that they've been on the air ,
and he has a chauffeur . 
maybe he drinks 
but he never drives a car either , you know , 
it's not the same with johnny carson . 
of invasion of privacy is trying to get personal information ,
and without your permission . 
this to me is my invasion of privacy . 
anytime i can honestly say no , or , throw the paper away , or , 
but you can always write to , uh , oh i forgot the name of it and stop the junk mail . 
that i've done . because i don't want junk mail anyway , 
so i wrote to them when it came on the air , 
so i don't get any of that bull , 
it works by the way . 
oh , good . 
but , uh , the telephone doesn't bother me because i leave it half the time , on , uh , you know , answering service anyway ,
so i figure i can turn it off one way or the other , 
but i think that's the only bottom line thing that i dislike . 
because it does , 
other than the u s census , um , 
what was it . 
oh the carpet place that called me three times , 
that i felt was invasion because it was the same carpet place , and called me three times . 
i mean one should be sufficient . 
that's right . 
but , if people don't use the telephone , 
 like i don't know when the police has their project going 
and i don't know when the other ones have their project going and when they want to pick up down my street for things . 
that's the only way i know . 
and , uh , i , 
well you have to have the telephone , 
but you can't , you know , 
sometimes it's hard to screen out all the calls that you don't want . 
well see there's no way of knowing , 
you know , that's the problem . 
like the product i sell , uh , i sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation . 
the only way we'd get to them is by telephone . 
and , uh , most of them like it because the company i work for is nationwide , and , uh , reputable 
and they know that hey , we're backing it , one hundred percent . 
but , if we were denied the right to call people up , these people would never be able to get it . 
because your normal companies that offer it , do not offer it in the amounts that we do 
and they'd never have it then , at that point . 
because we offer it in a very low , you know , quantity . 
so i mean , i don't know what to do as far as that's concerned . 
but it is nerve racking . 
i mean it is nerve racking to have the telephone , 
but at least , as i said , you can always say no thank you .
i gather you get a lot of telephone calls . 
some days it just rings off the wall . 
in other words you own your own home . 
i think that's where they hit most of us . 
like i own my own home . 
and you just know about what time , 
like some days i hate staying home because the phone rings all the time , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i haven't been able to figure that out . 
something else to do about it . 
if i have to give them so much to answer the questions to get fifty rolls of film or something like that , they're taking something away from me 
and i don't like that . 
yeah  , 
even if , i guess it's for coupons , they have a survey they run 
and one of them is supposed to be a smokers survey 
but the questions go a lot farther than having to do anything with smoking . 
and you know , they start out 
and they ask you even to your income level . 
i think that's , you know , 
whether you buy a t v dinner or not , i don't think it has anything to do with , 
have you recently bought a new car catherine ? 
and it doesn't seem like it's that old . 
seems like i just bought it . 
oh , wow . 
it's an eightynine 
and i bought it , uh , in , uh , eightyeight 
so , yeah . 
well , was a used car . 
i really don't prefer buying a new car . 
i like to let somebody else pay for that .
i know , 
i really will do that the next time ,
but , uh 
and we bought it for very functional purposes , 
and we bought a station wagon . 
we wanted an economical car 
but we wanted one that could carry a lot of equipment . 
so , we chose a nissan stanza wagon . 
and i've never been sorry , 
oh , that's wonderful . 
however the need for that 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , while it is still good ,
and probably then some .
i'll spend a lot of time praying over it before i give it up . 
i think that i would like to , 
you know , we all say , if i could have the car i always wanted 
i'm sold on nissans . 
or foreign cars actually . 
but do you feel though , uh , craftsmanship is much superior to the american abilities ? 
is that how you , 
i have never , 
its re , 
and , uh , you know , i've read all the consumer reports and things , 
and they just run head and shoulders above the american made cars . 
if ford was a head and the shoulders above it , i'd buy a ford . 
isn't that a shame . 
but i uh , had a ford escort that absolutely needed  taps  the day we got it . 
my word isn't that sorry . 
that's sorry . 
uh , you know , i mean it was ready for the graveyard . 
my word . 
and i spent as much on that car in twelve months as i spent for the car . 
oh , mercy . 
and that was just trying to hold us , 
getting out of that was a used car . 
and it was an older car , 
but , you know , escort is supposed to have a great track record 
but it just was not deliv , 
and you get stung a time or two , 
no thanks . 
that's right . 
so , i just trusted the consumer reports and the auto ,
had my son who knows a lot about that , study them thoroughly , 
and he gave me four choices of cars to buy .
an escort definitely was not among them . 
in fact , there wasn't an american car in there . 
uh , the nissan came 
and we bought the nissan for functional purposes not what the consumer reports said we should get . 
but it served our needs . 
uh , later on in the class that we were looking for . 
and i'd rather have a maxima than a cadillac . 
i really would . 
it's not necessarily prestige , 
but it's comfort . 
uh , there's a lot of features on there that are desirable if you're going to pay that kind of money for a car . 
who makes that car ? 
i mean but where are they , 
what is their location , 
is it , uh , asian 
or is it european 
or who , 
oh , it is japanese . 
i didn't know . 
and , uh , if i couldn't have my luxury maxima 
i mean , you know , every one of us have two sides .
i guess so 
that's true . 
yeah . 
now what about you , 
if you could have the car that you wanted 
and why ? 
probably , um , uh , let's see , i like the looks of the lincoln town car .
see there , 
 but i don't know the performance of it . 
that's a ,
and , you know , 
i tell you that's sad too because there one time ford was the best ,
really was . 
and , uh , i really have not seen , 
now a lot of the american cars parts are produced in foreign countries and assembled here or vice versa . 
can i put you on hold for one minute ? 
of course . 
thank you . 
well , that was one minute . 
they hung up . 
uh , at any rate do you have color preferences 
or what would be the features that you would be looking for ? 
um , well , the comfort of a large car that the security of a large car .
uh , now color preferences , 
i think i would opt to go with a bronze .
oh , wow . 
we like the stuff that glitters .
there's nothing wrong with that . 
actually i think probably if i were going to be practical , which doesn't mean i would be ,
well , practical 
and it's cooler i believe ,
now the interior , 
i don't care about the interior just as long as it's not black or red . 
 but if i had the little red  c r x   ,
and i'd have to live with that . 
and if i got the  c r x  it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too . 
i'd just go back to my teenage years and just throw all my experience to the wind .
um , can you , uh , hang on again hon , 
i've got the phones for lunch hour . 
just don't mind me if i bounce back and forth . 
that's okay . 
um , so you like to listen to , uh , a lot of music , 
or is it talk shows . 
but i will listen to the news and the traffic and those things at work . 
but if i'm going to be traveling in that car for any period of time ,
i love classical music , 
and you just can't enjoy it unless you've got a good sound system to produce all the , 
all the , 
that's true . 
so i do love classical music 
or it li , or , or , uh , 
do you listen t , 
w r r and the oasis are the two that i listen to ,
and i do like them . 
and i'd like to have a compact disc player in the car . 
that would be ,
those compact discs , 
they don't warp . 
you know , there's nothing in there that can wrap around the , uh , rollers or anything . 
it seems like a really good answer to portable music ,
okay , 
i do a fair amount of cooking . 
and i love having guests to dinner . 
i probably do that about once a month . 
and , uh , i usually prepare something , depending upon the guests , you know , 
i like to prepare chicken , that seems to please everybody , pasta or a casserole . 
how about you ? 
those are things i like the most . 
i like fish and chicken the most . 
and , uh , most of the cooking i do just comes out of a can . 
i catch a fish and i prepare it . 
and then uh , you know , i just broil it and put lemon on it . 
well , that's about the way i prepare most fish . 
uh , i made scallops the other night , 
that was unusual , 
and , uh , basically , uh , i found a recipe to make it in the microwave 
and microwaved them for about nine minutes . 
four and a half to five minutes 
and you had to add sesame seeds and bread crumbs on top , 
very simple , but very nice . 
so , if you are looking for a french recipe , that was good . 
sesame seeds and bread crumbs . 
sesame seeds and bread crumbs . 
and , uh , my husband liked it . 
and , uh , no 
unfortunately scallops are one of the more expensive , uh , fish items . 
but , you know , i look for them to go on sale at the grocery store .
uh , one of the things i love to do , eat out . 
how about you ? 
oh , yeah , 
do you have any particular places you like going ? 
i like that , 
it's just home cooking . 
i have been there . 
and , uh , it's kind of like black eye pea , 
but i do not think it's a chain . 
and that's the other restaurant   black eye pea . 
so , i do not really like , uh , you know , uh , uh , chili places or , what is it , judge roy bean's , 
oh , yeah . 
i do not feel like they are very healthy , 
and i always ,
you know , i tend to have chicken fried steak when i go to them . 
and i got , uh , chicken marinara the last two times . 
oh , how was it ? 
uh , it was great . 
because that's what i like , 
you know , a piece of chicken 
and then i get like green beans and mashed potatoes . 
you know . 
on food 
and sometimes i go for fairly exotic things . 
and my father teases me about gourmet cooking .
 and the thing about experimenting with cooking or anything else , is that some of the experiments fail . 
that's true . 
uh , the last time we had some , uh , friends over for dinner , i tried a dessert that sounded wonderful in the recipe 
and it was just a total bust . 
i was ,
uh , my brother tried to make , uh , a bunch of things , uh , way back . 
he tried to make bagels one time . 
oh my that's ambitious . 
and , uh , we took some 
and then we had , uh , german shepherds at the time , 
and we took some and gave it to the dogs , 
and the dog you know , he treated it like a milk bone 
and he never did finish it . 
he just barely made a dent in it . 
uh , and , uh , then he tried to made grapefruit citron one time . 
it's , uh , supposed to be candy . 
and , uh , it did not turn out very well , 
you know . 
so , uh . 
huh , see i am not , 
that's interesting . 
one of the things i do not make is dessert . 
and , uh , my husband accuses me of putting him through dessert depravation , because , uh , you know , we have ice cream , or something like that . 
and that's why when i did this experiment for the company we had about three weeks ago ,
uh , everything else was fine , 
but that was a fiasco . 
uh , yeah . 
yeah , 
just about . 
and i also don't have much of a sweet tooth , 
so i can live without dessert for the most part . 
use about half the sugar , 
or make everything diet . 
uh , do you cook for yourself 
or do you cook for others ? 
mostly , i just cook for myself . 
well , when i was single , a baked potato . 
it's easy , 
that's for sure . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah . 
and , i mean , i never put anything other than a little butter on it , 
or if i had a little cheddar cheese , sometimes i would grate that up . 
i always put cheese on them . 
and , uh , it's amazingly satisfying . 
but , you know , i guess there's hardly any protein , 
it's mostly starch . 
so , it fills you up 
and then the cheese has to make up for whatever the protein you get . 
i did not say it was nourishing , 
but it was satisfying . 
oh , yeah , 
it really is . 
then you have to make a salad 
 but , you know ,   i never really enjoyed cooking for myself , 
so i ate very simply . 
and i think that's one reason i like having people over , because i could try things . 
i mean , i must be a frustrated chemist or something like that . 
cause cooking is a little bit like being in a chemistry lab . 
and , uh , 
except you get to taste the product instead   .
and have an explosion . 
fill them up 
or blow up . 
sometimes it blows up anyway . 
to dinner when i was recently staying with my parents . 
and , uh , i had this wonderful recipe 
and you were supposed to make a toffee like substance for a pie by , uh , boiling evaporated milk three hours , 
and it does turn to toffee inside the can . 
oh , yeah .
and , uh , the only problem was , when i opened the can , it just flew all over the place . 
it was on the ceiling , on the walls and me . 
and the boy friend thought , 
he was supposed to be there at six o'clock , not seven o'clock , 
so just at the time all this happened , the door bell rang 
and there he was . 
and i had to have  ,
did you let the can cool off ? 
uh , i really do not remember , 
that was about ten years ago , 
i just remember how embarrassing it was . 
and and several times before 
and i never had that problem , 
just that one time . 
huh . yeah . 
and , uh , he was a gourmet cook , 
he was kind of  pushy too .  
acted like , he came from san francisco 
and he had a very sophisticated taste . 
i really wanted to impress the heck out of him 
and  , well , it was a memorable evening anyway . 
uh ,  as far as ,  
i do enjoy cooking 
are you ready ? 
oh , i see . 
that's fine . 
um , i think , uh , that's pleasurable for all of us , .
so , what are your thoughts on dining out ? 
well , i really choose restaurants more for the quality of food than anything else . 
not for the price ? 
but , uh , i think that as far as quality of food goes some of the most expensive places i've been 
the be , 
um , a lot of places that even don't look like much . 
or inside of a place that we drove up 
are you nuts ? 
and , uh , we went in 
and it was the most wonderful food . 
my word , 
i'm serious . 
um , uh , one place that we went just recently 
that's not right . 
what's the name of that restaurant ? 
  where at ?  .
the hari krishna . 
  oh . kalachandji's  .
it's all vegetarian , 
and it was just fabulous . 
i mean , my husband was aghast because i ate turnip greens and liked it . 
and where was that at , near your , 
um , kalachandji's . 
uh , it's a hari krishna run restaurant . 
is it in dallas ? 
is it in the phone book ? 
it should be . 
do you know how to spell it ? 
uh , it starts with a k . 
 kalli   , k a l l i ? 
that should get you close enough to be able to find it . 
i think it's , uh , probably listed in the restaurants , you know . 
but uh , it's just fabulous food . 
what about fast foods ? 
do you have a preference if you were going to ,
you do ,
see i don't like arby's . 
oh , really ? 
they use the insides of the animals , heart and liver 
and they form it , 
and they make it look like roast beef , 
thank you . 
oh , no , 
someone has been lying to you . 
what they use is roast beef . 
well , that's not what i heard ,
that's what , 
oh , my goodness . 
i'm surprised . 
my dad worked for arby's for several years . 
unless somebody is trying to blackball them . 
well , that's happened before . 
but we like mexican food . 
and stuff like that . 
and so , um , 
how about the health food , uh , restaurants ? well , like this one 
name one .
i'm not sure what you're talking about . 
but their fat content and , you know , the amount of calcium and so forth that are in each product 
and they list them . 
now there's one restaurant that does that 
and it's called rodolfo's 
over on preston road and royal lane i believe . 
and they have very good food over there . 
i don't guess i've ever been to anything like that 
they do um , you know , list the fat , 
it would be good i think , 
uh , i don't know how expensive they are . 
it sounds like that it would probably , 
well , it was pretty reasonable . 
it was around ten dollars for lunch . okay , 
which is kind of high for lunch i guess . 
for one person ? 
a bit .
uh , but , 
in going there .
well , i guess like taking somebody that you hadn't seen for a long time and wanted to show them a good restaurant .
 i could see that ,
and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime . 
i like the , 
because they're , 
well , they have lunch specials that 
you can't beat that price , uh , if you went to a cafeteria . 
probably that's true . 
but i know a lot of their specials sometimes are fried things ,
well , i had the , 
and it was excellent . 
it was a marinated , broiled chicken breast 
and it was exce , 
now why would you go to a seafood restaurant to eat chicken ? 
oh , it was , 
that's one of my husband's pet peeves . 
he doesn't understand why somebody would go to a seafood place and eat either chicken or steak , you know . 
well , i've never had catfish either in a restaurant because i'm from the north 
and that was a no no . 
oh , really ? 
and i haven't gotten over that from the north . 
oh , catfish is wonderful . 
i know they say that ,
oh , really . 
but i'm , 
and so i kind of stay a , 
because of all the pollution in the lakes and the , 
that's too bad ,
 well , yeah . 
so i am , 
and the best brand of chicken to buy is the , uh , pilgrim pride because they don't use all these hormones to  remote   , uh , unnatural growth in their products . 
so i mean , we have to be on the lookout if we want to stay healthy . 
that's true . 
so you know , i , 
oh , on one hand i see that 
and on the other hand , uh , my older sister 
so they're putting radioactive waste in it which reduces it dramatically . 
and then they take these things that will rust 
and they throw them in the ocean which is going to speedup the process even more . 
well , i'd like to get ahold of some engineers and knock their heads together if it would do any good . 
and then they wouldn't think . 
they were floating around 
so they shot holes in them to sink them . 
oh , dear . 
and this is before i was born . 
so , i mean we're taking thirty years ago ,
you know , the tuna is radioactive 
that's right . 
everything we eat . 
you can't get away from it 
so i think ,
yeah , 
 you know . so   you know we can't avoid for health purposes and some things that we just need to like , you know , 
this is not in my control . 
well , you know , 
so i'm either going to starve to death 
or i'm going to get over it and just go ahead and eat as healthily as i possibly can , you know . 
 well , becky , you know , even if you lived off your own land , that you would have to put caution signs , 
do you use credit cards a good bit ? 
and i wish i didn't .
before i got married , uh , about the only credit cards i used were gas cards , because i didn't like carrying , you know 
but i just never wanted to get into the hangup of using credit cards and 
in fact , i remember getting my first mastercard , 
and the only reason i got it was , you know , there was a while 
and so that's why i went ahead and got one . 
it was a mistake .
well , actually , i have a whole wallet full of credit cards . 
i don't use them very often . 
um , oh , keep those active . 
i have a half a dozen department store credit cards , 
and i'll use those if i need to run in and buy a dozen pair hose right quick 
just enough to keep them active . 
my biggies are the visa , mastercard and discover . 
and for the most part , i had used those for like , uh , charging airline tickets , where you know , you could 
or i fly southwest a good little bit , which means i can just run that card through the machine . 
that's right . 
uh , and it saves a lot time . 
and that's what i was using it for . 
you must have the money to do this with , 
and you do not have any other options 
 so i charged all three of those cards up , 
and right now i am paying and praying . 
i know how that goes 
but , uh , 
 and i mean 
we had no way around it 
 and the only way to do it is go get , you know , an advance 
 and so like you were paying for it , 
well , i never did , 
i never did use it for an advance . 
most of my charges were , uh , medications . 
oh , i see . 
didn't have cash for the medications 
or uh , the doctor would accept mastercard or visa . 
and , uh , 
different labs will 
do you find now , though , that even some doctors won't ? 
i've found some doctors that say , you know , 
i was so used to doctors or medical care places taking credit cards , 
well , i have not , 
like i said , that was just one period in my life where that was critical . 
i don't generally charge . 
and i kind of set that aside 
i'm reimbursed on insurance anyway , 
and i can handle , you know , paying for it and waiting two or three weeks . 
getting into a credit card fiasco is easy . 
oh , it is .
it is easy , 
and it's very difficult to get out . 
i just cringe every month when i see those interest charges . 
i know . 
i ought to go to the credit union and borrow the money and pay this off . 
big deal , 
i'm saving two percent . 
but , you know , the interest , even though it bothered me , it didn't used to bother me so much , because , of course , you could list it on a schedule a 
and you got all your interest , you know 
and now they've messed that up to where it really is a financial burden to have to pay it . 
but it is easy to get into a credit card problem , 
and i think about young people that think , you know , 
i have my first credit card 
 and they just don't understand that you still have to be able to make the payments . 
oh , yeah , 
you know . 
that's right . 
uh , you send in , uh , uh , fifty dollars , 
you're going to pay twenty , twentyfive in interest charges . 
that's right . 
you only get half of that paid for the principal , 
so i'm looking at three or four years before my balances are cleared on those charge accounts . 
now , uh , i mean as the monthly payment amount goes down , that will free up more cash where i can continue to make the larger payments . 
uh , as long as i don't have a major disaster where i have to use it again , i can do that . 
meantime , though , i'm not building any reserves . 
and that's frightening to me . 
anything that i could be put aside into savings is going for interest on those cards . 
that's right . 
that's frightening , too . 
uh , my husband is in business for himself 
i work for t i 
but he doesn't 
 and , uh , crossed . 
i've learned when you're in business for yourself , that you don't count on something until it's happened 
but you know , it's those once in a lifetime cases , 
and after ten years he's got two of them 
 and they should pay through next month , 
oh , right , 
and , you know , just in one lump , 
because that's the only way you can do it , is to have a big chunk of money 
 or it's like you say , 
you pay forever . 
and so i'm really looking forward to that . 
well , you either need a big chunk of money 
or you need a large reserve 
that's right . 
now , those are very handy 
if you have the reserves and you can make lump sum payments , sharp , good 
i agree . 
 because you're living on the other guy's money for a while . 
that's right .
but i can promise you that those credit card companies are going to ride high on my money .
i know 
and it just irks me . 
and i've got three cards . 
i've lost a whole day of my life 
i know . 
and that just blows my mind . 
my house is paid for , 
my car is paid for , 
i've got some home improvements , 
but even the payment on that doesn't equal the payment on one of those credit cards . 
it's incredible . 
boy , i wish i could say that my house and , 
well , my car is paid for now . 
it was wrecked three weeks ago , 
but you see again 
i had to have the money to pay rental car , pay this , pay that till the insurance company pays back . 
that's right . 
i think 
and , uh , 
because you know that's coming back to pay it off . 
uh , i went to a seminar , 
you only use credit cards for investments . 
that's right . 
that doesn't make a bit of sense to me . 
that's right . 
well , the smart half was don't pay it for consumables , 
you know , if you can't afford to go to a restaurant and eat out and pay cash , don't put it on a credit card 
that's right . 
that is the smart half . 
uh , and i can remember before we had kids , we did that a lot , 
but it was no biggie 
while after kids , and you're paying child care and other things , all of a sudden it's not so easy to pay off , 
so we cut that out real quick .
i do like having them there . 
there is a bit of security in having the credit cards and knowing that in times of crisis , they are there to use 
 but you have to have a very good sense of saving , or 
you also have to have that willingness to commit to that 
well , pat , did you vote in the last election ? 
oh , you did ? 
yes ma'am . 
oh , that's great . 
well , why do you think ,
don't always 
i sometimes vote against somebody .
that makes sense too . 
i think that a lot of it is , uh , 
i know that my late husband was simply indifferent . 
he didn't feel like he had any say . 
there was too many people , too many other votes . 
if i go vote you'll cancel my vote . 
then does , 
i think , that's a lot of people , 
just indifferent .
i know that 
in the past , um , three years i've had three different addresses . 
each time i change jurisdictions or whatever . 
so i just haven't , 
because , i mean , graduate school or whatever , 
so i haven't kept track of it . 
i voted . 
but this past time i didn't . 
well , actually i voted it for the presidential election , 
but then i didn't vote 
well characteristically , in the local elections 
if i do not feel very strongly about an issue , then i see no reason to go vote . 
and that's probably one reason why i voted in the 
because this one really didn't matter that much . 
it's probably true . 
well , the instructors , you'll find out that everything matters , 
but then you could go crazy worrying about everything . 
well , you know , they also say that most people vote their local politics , much more important than , uh , national 
 and that's the way you make changes about 
oh , i definitely think so . 
uh , i know that i have been involved in preparing and in , uh , carrying out a lot of the local petitions that take place . 
even something so simple as getting a street light in between 
but it makes a big difference when it's the difference in having a child run over 
that's true . 
and , uh , it took a close call to wake us up and cause us to take 
and that's completely unnecessary . 
in another particular case they were trying to put in a , um , senior citizen's home 
but if you just cross that major street , the character of the neighborhood changes , 
and it's less savory . 
and i felt very strongly about that , 
those people simply did not have access to safety , to security 
and they were at risk . 
and it was for elderly people who lived alone , 
and they were going to put a cluster of houses there for them . 
but even clustering together for the elderly does not ensure safety . 
most now , 
that's true , 
and all it did was to , in my judgment , make them ,
prepare them to be ,
easier targets , 
and so we did get a petition together 
and we very strongly resisted it , 
and closer to my neighborhood 
 but it was on the ,
right side ,
and , uh , they're much more comfortable there . 
did they , 
uh , i haven't seen too much crime in my neighborhood , 
although we have a good crime watch program 
 but it's very serious 
um , did you think , 
i know that texas's last gubernatorial , uh , election probably brought out a lot of voters . 
did that seem to , 
because national attention , i guess , having a woman governor 
i don't think it had to do to with woman running against man . 
i think it had to do with dirt running against dirtier . 
and that's it 
it was a dirty election . 
people were calling each other , uh , names and every bit of the trash , 
it was a dirty campaign . 
it was a dirty , mud slinging campaign . 
well , you know , what's funny , up here , uh , i see a lot of virginia news 
 and i guess , uh , senator robb and governor wilder 
and they have some type of wire tapping problem 
and the people in virginia are complaining , 
see robb is married to lynda bird johnson 
 and the people in virginia are complaining that he's using texas politics in virginia 
 and they're really complaining big time , 
because they said that we don't have that type of trashy politics up here like they do in texas all the time . 
 so you guys were getting 
we've had some pretty 
you were getting slandered , i think , 
 but , historically , texas has had mud and muddier campaigns 
 i mean , i think that eventually , you know , the better people have sensibilities 
and they vote on those people who are least likely to do damage . 
unfortunately , that's not always the way it should be . 
you don't want to vote for the person who is least likely to do damage . 
you want to do the one who can do the most good . 
do the most good , 
that's true . 
and , uh , 
i guess that's why , 
i know that , um , i'm previously from pennsylvania 
 and dick thornburg who's now the attorney general 
 and i know that they're expecting a gigantic turn out to landslide dick thornburg into the senate 
 and they're almost expecting landslide 
so you 
isn't that too bad . 
we really could use a little positive motivation 
hey , we think this guy can really make some changes 
and we're going to support him . 
that was true in a lot of cases in a couple of the older sixties campaigns . 
in texas , 
was that when , you , 
that's true . 
uh , even when john kennedy was elected , there were so many strikes against him , 
but there were people who believed he could make a difference . 
now , that's not to say what has transpired or what really was , 
i'm saying 
that's , right , 
that's perception , 
that's true . 
and , uh , 
because that was a big , um , turn out 
oh , yeah . 
and it was people going to vote for , i think , more than those who voted against . 
i know that in my own , uh , area of people , whom i knew and how they were going to vote , they didn't go to vote against , uh , a politician as they did a little bit later when nixon was running . 
they went to vote against the lesser of the two evils in certain cases . 
 but i think that one was one that 
and they voted their convictions . 
well , i think that also happened with ronald reagan . 
he was 
you're right . 
and people really saw that was , 
uh , so , uh , what do you consider the most important benefit besides salary ? 
boy , i don't know . 
a tough one . 
uh , uh , and of what , uh , i'm getting gypped on 
that week , 
uh , and i guess right now the one in my mind is health insurance 
but , uh , 
what about you ? 
well , uh , right now i'm in sort of a weird situation . 
i'm a graduate student that , uh 
oh , okay . 
i don't have that many benefits per se .
uh , sort of get , 
but , on the other hand , one of these days you'll be out looking for a , 
my wife has a real job 
and i can see from her angle . 
uh , uh , i think health insurance is real , real important .
i mean , even in my case they're really , uh , a pain in the neck about it up here 
because the university makes me buy a small , 
they have what they call the mandatory portion of their health insurance 
they offer insurance to everyone , 
but then the basics that are major medical , they force you to buy here . 
now i'm covered by my wife's anyway , 
but i still pay them a hundred dollars a semester 
so that's sort of annoying that i'm paying for something i'm not getting in that case . 
i'd rather that went to something else . 
and , yeah , 
and the benefits you're getting for that hundred dollars a semester , uh , you never use because you just use your wife's . 
i mean , uh , 
and use them 
and it turns out that i do think they're excellent physicians there . 
so , through my wife's h m o , we've registered for them as our primary care physicians 
so we go there anyway , 
so if they were to bill , which , which i believe they don't , 
but if they were to bill the h m o for my business , they could , in theory , be getting paid twice for the same thing . 
but they're not , thank god . 
uh , but anyway , uh , otherwise , i would imagine , uh , good vacation is important , although i don't know if that's really a deciding factor for many people on a job . 
i don't , you know , 
uh , yeah , 
uh , i worked five years civil service 
and there or hours per pay period or something , 
but , anyway it works out as i remember basically to , uh , 
you start at , uh , two and a half weeks or something like that , 
and at three years , uh , it goes to four weeks i believe , 
and i've been at t i now , uh , uh , coming up on fifteen years 
uh , this year is going to go to four weeks here 
oh , wow . 
uh , uh , 
so that's really , 
probably not a deciding factor , 
but , uh , 
i mean , i know my wife , uh , 
i think she gets , you know , about two weeks a year , i guess 
 but they're pretty good about it if she wants other time off . 
they , you know , usually let her , 
well , that , 
how flexible they are for comp time kinds of 
and , uh , uh , that's the , uh , 
that's you could take your vacation in increments of one hour 
oh , really . 
 but , uh , there wasn't , uh , anything as far as comp time , 
so you tend to dribble away a week of it a year , uh , you know , an hour here 
uh , whereas , uh , here isn't that much different , 
well , that's a 
i think the health insurance , 
i think that's going through changes everywhere to , uh , 
they've , uh , uh , gone through a couple years ago here where they , uh , will cover you much better if you go to their designated hospitals 
and now they're in the process of developing a list of , uh , designated doctors , uh , 
so that just routine visits , uh , they will compensate much better for , if you go to their designated doctors . 
which , uh , 
my assumption is that , that will not include my doctor since , uh , he keeps real busy without having to , uh , 
weigh all sorts of other things . 
yeah , 
i think , i was watching something the other day about that actually on , uh , a news special or something like that 
and they were saying how in some sense that , that's good because that makes health care affordable for everyone and you know , lowers the cost of everything and all insurance 
and in other cases it's actually bad because it winds up people , you know , they have much less of a choice in who they can use and stuff like that 
well , in the much bigger picture than , uh , to some extent hospitals and doctors have some , uh , fixed amount 
and , you know , give you these rates and make this agreement 
and the added costs get passed on to you , 
who you go to for a doctor and things like that , uh , where it's the government that decides , 
here it's , uh , 
least off , who decides . 
uh , the effect is the same as the , 
you , uh , get left out of the loop more . 
and helping hold down the costs 
 but , uh , i don't know , 
a big factor . 
i want to know if the doctor's doing the right thing to make me 
you want to know you 
that's the , 
uh , what the possible choices could be about reorganizing the trial by jury , 
but , uh , i think it works better than many other systems , like having a judge decide . 
i can't think of many alternatives that could be more fair than having twelve people decide , although it's difficult because they all have to be unanimous . 
now do you agree , that they should all be unanimous ? 
i don't , 
or even in , uh , like they said , you know , lesser , you know , trials , you know , lesser convictions , do you think that they should be all unanimous still ? 
i don't know , 
i don't feel real strongly about that . 
if the , uh , 
the thing is , though , a jury .
i guess , if you request one you can . 
but i think , 
making it unanimous sometimes the only thing , it might let more people get off . 
i don't think it would convict any more people . 
and we have so many people already , you know , 
the jails are already overloaded . 
well , the thing is they stay until they all are unanimous . 
i mean if one is determined you know , that he feels that he's , you know , going against the other eleven , they all stay until everyone agrees . 
so i don't know if it would leave anyone getting off more unless someone just gets tired of fighting , you know , just gives in . 
well , if it's , 
but what if they never agree . 
uh , do they have to go back and do a whole new trial 
and they have to stay in until they all agree 
agree .
i don't know , 
i'm not sure if they go , i mean to twelve new people or what they do exactly , 
but i do know for sure that all twelve have to agree before you know , either he or she can either go free or to jail , either one . 
and that maybe on the lesser crimes that aren't too severe , that's a little stringent .
especially because there's twelve . 
the thing about it is , i think jury selection , too , 
a lot of times , uh , the lawyers are able to pick and choose who they want on the jury 
and they can sway them that way , too . 
that's just it . 
i don't understand . 
you're supposed to , you know , go in you know , like if you've never heard of the people before or anything , 
but i don't understand with racialism and the way religion is and everything else how you can get people that are totally impartial to it . 
i know . 
well , i guess you really can't , 
but the other thing is when they have the sensational trials , how they get people who aren't swayed by the news either . 
and that's kind of tricky , too , because a lot of positions the judges are in , they can't be fired , you know , 
they stay till they retire 
 and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements , too .
i agree . 
i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone . 
not only , you know , that they have to stay in there , 
how many times have you heard of judges being bought over . 
i know . 
you know , so in the end , the judge has the presiding , you know , uh , vote . 
i don't know if it's the way it is in real life , 
but i've seen it on t v where the juries go one way 
and the judge totally finds it obnoxious 
and he completely , you know , goes the other way . 
now , i'm not sure if the judge is allowed to do that in everyday life or what . 
i think in some cases they are . 
but they know they get to decide how severe the sentence is 
so that's another thing where they have the power , 
but maybe juries could be less than twelve people 
or would that be more fair or less fair . 
maybe there should be more than twelve people .
i don't , 
oh , oh , my god . 
if there were more than twelve , can you imagine how long they'd be sitting .
i know . 
i don't know . 
i mean , i think it's as fair as it can possibly get , 
but i just think it's really har , you know , 
i mean , some cases go on for years , you know . 
that's true , 
and i've never been on jury duty , 
but they have to keep going and going and going .
i don't know how it could be more fair . 
course , i don't know . 
it could be , 
i've never seen one in real life either 
so you know , i don't know that much about it , 
but a pretty fair system compared to other countries . 
i don't know how we could make it more fair . 
i really don't . 
the unanimous vote is questionable , though . 
how many cases get juries might 
because , uh , i don't know if you should really have a jury for a small infraction . 
but i'm not sure who gets them .
i don't know anything .
i know . 
i don't know that much about it either . 
i don't know . 
i guess maybe if they'd go and they'd ask someone in jail , you know , how they can make it more fair for them or not , 
but then again , maybe they should be there 
so that is fair . 
i don't think anyone's going to come up with a better way . 
whoever came up with this was pretty smart because it was pretty , uh , unique 
uh , in , uh , 
what do i do now ? 
do you know ? 
or just 
i don't 
what else to say , 
well it was nice talking with you . 
well , how do you feel about spot testing for drugs ? 
uh , i think if somebody's not on drugs , they have no reason , you know , to be afraid of it . 
uh , i do think that there has to be some controls , uh , 
like , i don't think one test positive should , uh , be , uh , the end of it , you know . 
 i think they should test more than once . 
i mean , all these people that are against it you know , they may not even be on drugs . 
they call it an invasion of privacy . 
and i don't see that . 
to me that just doesn't sound like a valid argument because this company is paying you good money that you're working for 
that's right . 
 and i believe that ,
there's so many jobs that , uh , 
you know , and it's , uh 
 uh , how can you do anything about a problem besides if you don't know about it ? 
you know , and i think 
  right  .
i guess it is possible to have a false positive report . 
a well thought out , sane approach to ,
just because something can get mixed in the mail , 
 and , yeah , 
you know  , 
 or somebody's test gets mixed up with somebody else's . 
 i mean , those things do happen . 
uh , i certainly wouldn't want people's lives ruined 
 and , you know , i've 
 well , you know , within the last couple of years , instituted for all new hired employees , 
they submit to a urine test . 
and , they've also implemented random testing . 
and    , it hasn't happened to me in the couple of years that , you know , it's been in progress 
 but , uh , i fully agree with it 
and you know , there's all these memos going around about folks that are disgruntled and feel it's an invasion of privacy , 
you've probably got something you're trying to hide .
and you maybe need to look for some other type of job to do 
uh , to me it's not an invasion or privacy . 
i think uh , 
or , the quality of their product . 
the work they're doing for their company . 
uh , those things are all affected . 
if not immediately , it certainly does eventually . 
i think that's where a lot of the problem is at first . 
it doesn't seem to , uh , bother the quality of work 
 but eventually it does . 
because it usually requires more and more of that substance that you're misusing 
course , i feel the same way on the aids problem . 
i don't think that's an invasion of privacy , 
that's  ,
and it's destroying a lot of 
 and then 
and it's destroying people's lives 
and know about it and be aware of it . 
i don't know . 
it's kind of hard to 
i guess the gay movement has had a lot to do with considering that , uh , an invasion of privacy . 
uh , do you work for , uh , texas instruments ? 
and the central , 
but i don't know how familiar you are with texas , 
but uh , near a town called temple .
oh , that's probably why , 
my brother did live in grapevine , texas . 
that's near dallas . 
we're probably about two , two and a half hours south of him . 
it's pretty hot down there probably . 
actually , we got about two inches of rain in about three hours , yesterday . 
oh , did you really ? 
 and it's 
 oh , that's great . 
it's getting more humid now , 
 we need rain real bad up here . 
uh , everything's really getting dry . 
it's , uh , 
it's been about three weeks since we've had any . 
it's kind of at a dangerous level here . 
people hauling water , 
and , uh 
how about that ? 
well , i hope you do get some rain up there . 
uh , i can't think of anything else , uh . 
i guess being in agreement 
uh , i can understand .
i know if somebody is using drugs and doesn't think there's anything wrong with them , i can see them objecting . you know ? 
there's a lot of people that   .
one of the things i found interesting , 
it's funny that you mentioned that , 
t i is pretty much a worldwide company 
 and we have manufacturing plants all around the world 
um . uhhuh , 
 they don't have to submit to drug testing like they do here in the states and some places abroad . 
oh , i'll be darn . 
i thought that was kind of interesting too . 
the different cultures and that 
 i mean , uh , uh , from a quality standpoint , i mean , just because it's not illegal doesn't mean it doesn't affect you the same way . 
i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way . 
i can't think that would make any difference 
 it would still have to affect you the same way . 
but , like if you're going to do business in another country , you've got to respect their rules . 
i mean that's the trade off . 
oh yeah . 
you go by their laws . 
the same way our people have to go by their laws when they're over there . 
that's why a lot get in trouble 
and , uh 
and you use them , you .
usually with you life in some places . 
a lot of them . 
that's right . 
from the middle east . 
is that where it is ? 
i thought , wow .
you know , that's quite a deterrent .
well , in saudi arabia , you know , using , uh , alcohol and drugs and something like that , you get the death penalty . 
so , it's pretty strict over there .
so i guess , you know , we have so many freedoms over here we sometimes forget about how 
and you can't stop me , 
and you know  , 
they abuse it 
yeah . 
yeah . 
yeah . 
so , that's , 
i don't know . 
i'm glad to see more and more companies implementing the policy , 
let's talk about schooling . 
uh , what contacts do you have with the public school sy , 
well , i have a boy 
and he just went into middle school , 
and i have a girl , 
and she's in , uh , grade school , 
and then i have a little boy who goes to , uh , 
they have something just before kindergarten , 
and it's called early childhood , 
and i have a young 
oh , okay . 
so in the school system down here . 
and , um , i think we have excellent teachers here . 
i am really , uh , 
like the way the teachers work with the students . 
uh , i've not been so , um , happy with the schools themselves , i guess . 
like , last year , my son and daughter were in the same grade school 
and it was just packed . 
i mean , it was a fire hazard if we had any kind of assembly there with parents . 
and it was just a real problem . 
uh , so we had to do a bond issue work for another school to be built , which is a good idea , 
but in the meantime , the school still has lots and lots of kids in it . 
so , um , i think one thing is that would , 
maybe we don't have enough schools , 
and secondly , when we have enough schools , sometimes we can't get the support for the teachers that we need to pay them to keep good teachers . 
well , i think that's , uh , true . 
i've got a little different , uh , contact , 
but one son that graduated from high school last year 
 and , uh , my wife teaches kindergarten here in richardson . 
oh , great . 
uh , but , in general , was the schools , 
and i think that plano and richardson in terms of the , uh , things seriously wrong with the public schools are not nearly to the extent that 
we see through out the country . 
 uh , right , 
and uh , a big part of that is just the demographics , 
the population in those schools are , typically , uh , people that very much value the education and support 
i think that's right . 
still some problems , 
but , uh , when i was going to school , 
i grew up in iowa , 
and , in my family , school was certainly valued , 
but if i was ever in trouble in school , i was also in trouble at home 
and i think that part of it uh 
the home , 
i think that's right . 
it is so hard with a family system , um , either divorced or just one parent 
that's true . 
and then , if both of them have to work , even that is a hard situation 
 and i think it's real important that the parents work with the school , um 
i think what you said is really a pinpoint , though , that the student and the family life really adds or detracts 
 so , um , what about your wife , 
is she happy at school 
or   .
 well , uh , she works very hard as a kindergarten teacher . 
i bet she does . 
she has two half day classes . 
so she 
is in , uh , child development , and 
and so kindergarten is as high as she wants to teach , 
and she's 
so , yeah , 
uh , but , uh , the  . . . 
um , i'm a firm believer in having lots of them . 
i'm sitting at my desk now with four machines in front of me . 
 you have four machines around you , 
boy , well , uh , you've got me beat . 
i have a zenith here 
 and at home i have a commodore 
and my wife has an a t and t twelve hundred , i believe it is . 
good grief . 
what do you do with all those ? 
well , actually on my commodore i mainly study lottery numbers , would you believe . 
i have written some , uh , programs in basic 
i have another program in which i can look at the cyclical , uh , appearance of these numbers 
i have another program that allows me to add all the numbers i want , 
and then it generates a complete set of numbers so that all combinations are covered 
 so this is what i do most of the time , uh , 
that's what you do on at least one of your machines 
on your commodore . 
and of course i have , uh , word processors , 
and i write all my letters 
it's wonderful , uh , 
my , uh , thoughts in my head 
and i get 
and naturally on a computer if you make a mistake , who cares , 
you can go back and , uh , correct it very easily 
 so that makes it very , very nice . 
i get all my thoughts down and go back and clean it up very , very readily . 
so how about you , charles ? 
well , um , i do an awful lot of preparation of documents , um , uh , 
and i use word processors i mean 
some of them i do on a sun , 
some i do on an x t 
 now maybe we don't call these personal computers , um , 
i started out with , you know , an i b m p c you know , about a year after they came out 
 and , you know . 
so , may i ask where you work , sir ? 
i work for the government in washington . 
i know you work for the government , 
i just wondering are you an    , 
in an obscure part of the defense department . 
oh , uhhuh , 
because , see , that's my type of work , too . 
i work at the applied research lab 
and , my field is underwater acoustics 
 and there's a lot of things we can do with computers into , uh , studying how , uh , things vary in the water , you know 
so it's a very nice field , 
and end of december , excuse me . 
are you also a professor , 
or do you 
but i'm a full time researcher 
 and it's , uh , been a very , very interesting career , believe me . 
i can believe . 
what are you going to do when you stop , i mean , take all your machines with you , or , 
but i have similar machines at home . 
i would consider doing some more consulting when i get home 
 but i have a very , very busy extra life anyway . 
i'm also a musician , 
and i play in several symphony orchestras 
 and , uh , i run a concert band , 
 but i do want to get much more deeply into computer work , because obviously the world is going to be controlled 
there's no doubt about it , 
because it is really taking over , 
and the amount of work that we're doing and the depth of things that we are studying can basically only be handled by computers , because , uh , it's so much involved 
 and it sounds as though you're probably more aware of that than i am , because , uh , i don't get to use it in my daily work as much as i would like to . 
here again 
 uh , so basically what i'm doing is slowly getting rid of my things . 
for many , many years i had a full size acoustics , uh , study laboratory 
and so that's gone now , 
and so i'm sort of out of business . 
uh , as i say , i worked with   
fellow named steve blazey 
 and he is now retired . 
so it's been an interesting life , 
and computers have come in towards the latter end of that . 
i wish we had had computers in the very beginning . 
it would have been , 
seem to have the topic already on tip of your tongue there 
yes , sir . 
that's great . 
the reason i say that is pretty timely because just tonight i went out and changed the oil in my car 
uh , and there's not a whole lot you can do without the equipment and electronic analysis that needs to be done on a car , 
but i do like to get out and tinker with a car 
and it's something i can do still . 
do you enjoy working with your car ? 
i don't even remember what it is . 
i've had to have oil changes done myself because i live in an apartment complex ,
oh , dear . 
we can't even wash our vehicle , 
oh , that's too bad . 
uh , but the last thing i can remember doing wh , 
i had a sixtysix mustang , 
and that was all right because like you said that was pre technology days , i guess . 
oh , yes . 
and , uh , you know , you could do a lot of it yourself still , 
and , uh , i didn't tinker too much with the engine . 
it was in pretty good shape , 
but my main concern and what i enjoy doing was the interior . 
and , uh , it was pretty shelled , uh , 
but it was fun . 
it was taking you know , the whole interior apart and , you know , ordering new carpeting and , uh , 
and did you install all that yourself ? 
well , that was , 
uh , she , you know , helped out a little . 
we sanded down the insides of the door panels .
do you still have the car ? 
well , that's too bad . 
a sixtyseven car . 
it was fun though . 
i really enjoyed it , 
and i was surprised at , uh , the availability of parts yet . 
you know , you can still get factory original parts . 
but , uh , you pay a premium 
but you just don't get them . 
i didn't . 
i went ahead and got , you know , japanese made duplicates or wherever they were made , 
you know , prefabs and all that stuff 
well , you know , that's fine . 
a quality difference . 
i don't know . 
and , uh , i had heard rumors that it was because they couldn't duplicate certain patterns , uh , exactly . 
and so like the glove box was just a little , 
oh , dear . 
i had to cut some of the sides down . 
oh , dear . 
but just little things . 
you know , one of the screws uh , window regulators 
you could get three of the four to lineup . 
the fourth one you couldn't get to lineup no matter what you did . 
you know , thin , 
that's true . 
well , you know , that is something i really enjoy doing . um , working on our car too , 
oil tonight 
but , uh , i enjoy also working on things like the brakes 
and , uh , in fact , just two weeks ago i helped my neighbor out on his brakes on his car . 
and , uh , either if it's a drum or disc brakes , i enjoy working on those kind of things . 
disc brakes don't seem to give me too much problem 
but i honestly don't have the tools for the drum . 
i know you got , uh , certain spring lever that you got to have or uh 
spoons and , 
you do .
uh , my dad has got all that 
i helped him when i was growing up , 
but i don't have that stuff now , 
because of the drum brakes i , you know , don't have any choice but to take them in . 
that's true . 
and , you know , doesn't hurt every once in a while to have them done professionally too 
because , um , i was helping my neighbor out 
and one of his drums needed to be resurfaced 
and i don't have , of course , the equipment to do that , 
so he took it into a shop and had it and fixed that way . 
but , yeah , 
it is true , uh , you know , 
i did have a sixtyfour ford truck that i wish i still had and loved to get inside that and tinker around with it and work with it ,
i'll tell you what . 
the nicest thing about them is , uh , everything was standard . 
you didn't have to worry about finding a metric anything . 
 oh , yeah . 
boy , i tell you . 
and you know , 
uh , what do you think are the major social changes ? 
what age , uh , if you don't mind me asking . 
well , i'm , uh , thirtyone . 
oh , well , you're young . 
i'm in my 
so you should take my word 
you're young .
oh , you know , i've seen a social change , 
it's definitely , 
for sure , 
uh , uh , and besides that , i came from california where social change is like , you know , 
every day ? 
i mean every second . 
you know , social change in california means it takes another two or three minutes longer to get to work . 
i can believe that .
and , uh , it started , you know , actually going to work in eightytwo , 
i guess that's when it was . 
between eightytwo and eightyfive , uh , it started out taking me an hour and fifteen minutes to get to work , 
and then it became , you know , an hour and a half , to , you know , some days , two hours to get to work . 
that's social change . 
that's social change . 
well , what do you think is the major social change ? 
right now . 
that's a tricky one . 
i'll let you go first . 
i think probably the big major change is the role of women . 
i think , one , the women , uh , in the work force . 
and i think the fact that they're becoming , uh , more , uh , how do i want to say , not necessarily politically inclined , 
but they're more apt to be in political offices 
i think , you know , we've made great strides 
i think that thirty years ago , when , uh , i was newly married , family was very , very important . 
then i think we veered where the family was not as important a unit . 
and i think now it's revolving back full circle . 
i think 
oh , i think that's probably for two reasons . 
uh , you know , the number one is , women wanted to get out of the house . 
and the second reason is everything costs so much more that if you don't have , you know , equal rights so that your wife gets equal pay , you can't make twice as much .
that's true , 
well , i know that economically , uh , a wife almost has to work anymore . 
and yet , i'm also noticing , uh , in the areas that i'm working and stuff , more and more women are wanting now to stay home with the children where fifteen years ago 
i mean , you know , they wanted children , 
but they still wanted to be their own person out in the work force . 
but i am seeing women now wanting to stay home 
and , uh , i find that very interesting that 
i mean , not married , 
wrong word . 
where the wife has gone to school , you know 
but still , you know , after five years , it's like , first kid 
 and then they're out of the work force for another ten years . 
but , i think most of those people are still out .
i think that generation , they're all at home right now 
and we won't see them back for another two or three years . 
uh , are , you know , past that age when they've been away for a few years . 
but , uh , it's kind of different . 
it is . 
i note that i had , taken care of my grandchildren recently while my daughter and her husband had been out of town . 
and i do not envy these mothers 
i mean , that's tough . 
i , uh , 
i don't envy these young parents .
i'm an assistant scout master 
and it's like , uh , 
parents , uh , even rarely see their kids for weekends , which is , you know , kind of rough , too . 
that's true . 
especially now . 
i don't know . 
you're going to be doing your worst running around when you're fifty .
and you're absolutely nuts .
that , uh , 
let's see , 
one of them's fortynine 
and well , the other one , i don't know what her age is , 
but i know she is somewhere in that hairy age of half a century up there . 
and , uh , boy , i'll tell you , 
these are the gogettingest , happiest people i've ever met . 
you know , because , 
well , you can be go getting , 
but you can also get gray hairs and have a nervous breakdown .
i'm thirty , 
i'm getting gray hairs already .
i just know it would absolutely exhaust me . 
maybe it's because it's my grandchildren 
and it's not my children . 
 maybe that's , 
uh , let me see , i've got two children . 
one is , uh , 
both preschoolers , 
one is two 
and one is , uh , four . 
and , uh , this is my first year off , 
and i've always worked , uh , from the time that they were little 
and so i decided to which i hadn't been doing . 
well , i think that's wonderful . 
my children are in college . 
but i teach school 
and i teach , uh , middle school age children . 
and so i see a lot of , uh , variation in what happens when kids are at home . 
uh , i have taught school ever since my children were little . 
but the advantage of teaching school is your hours are closer to your children's 
and your holidays are , too . 
so teaching , i think is a good career to have and still be able to spend a lot of quality time with kids . 
well , that's what i was doing before , 
i was teaching for richardson school district . 
and , uh , it just seemed like it took a lot of my time with them being so little . 
and it's really hard . 
well , with them being as young . 
it was much , much harder when mine were young . 
and , uh , i really didn't have that much of a choice because my husband was trying to finish his , uh , college work 
and so it was a matter of somebody had to have a   job . 
that's right , 
and that's what was kind of where we were , you know , 
i really didn't have to work , 
but i felt like i really wanted to work . 
and i also felt like , boy , i was sure missing a lot 
and they were growing so fast 
that choice was there , 
i really didn't have to 
and ,  , so i did have that advantage there , 
but it's different staying home too , you know . 
it certainly is . 
it's an adjustment to make , also . 
well , i think that , uh , we need to spend more family time together with children today . 
uh , we made a point to spend a lot of quality time 
and the activities that we were involved in were the activities the kids were 
we participated . 
and , uh , we always made a point to have breakfast together and supper together now . 
wow , that's great . 
when , uh , the kids were in high school , it was harder to always have supper together , 
but we did always have breakfast together . 
so , we had supper together as much as possible , 
you know , we kind of kept a master calendar 
and we sat around the table , 
we didn't sit in front of a t v or 
wow , that's great . 
so i think that's been important , because we do have a close family 
 and even though the kids are basically , uh , grown , uh , they still like to sit down at the table and us all eat together when they're here and 
kind of goes on . 
they do what they see , you know . 
that's right . 
they model 
and , with the dysfunctional families today , i'm sure , as a schoolteacher also , you see 
and then you see them magnified in the children . 
plus , you teach middle school , 
so i'm sure that , 
oh , boy , 
you really , 
boy , oh , boy . 
i taught early childhood 
 so i had the little ones . 
and , uh , you know , i saw it there , too , 
and it's , kind of an eyeopener . 
it is . 
and i think most teachers realize the value of quality time with children 
 and i think we make a point to do that . 
i think you're right . 
because  , we see all the time , the outcome of not doing that 
 and i think if we weren't so interested in child care , then we wouldn't be teaching anyway . 
uh , i wish we could reach more of the rest of the world .
i think , uh , the major problems in education are not what's happening in the schools , 
it's what's happening in the families . 
i agree , 
and , uh , they expect us to , you know , create miracles at school and fix all the problems and take over the roles of the parents as well as that of the teachers 
 and you get to a point where it's completely impossible . 
i agree . 
i know exactly what you're saying .
and you just get more and more frustrated 
and yet , you feel for the kids . 
you do the best you can 
uh , what do you consider an invasion of privacy ? 
and , uh , i guess invasion of privacy , uh , to me , for example would be unauthorized use of credit cards 
and , uh , i guess recently one of the t v stations here , uh , ran a series of , uh , news casts on unauthorized credit card usage and how easy it was to get a person's credit card numbers .
it's very easy . 
and i was quite surprised at that . 
i guess i can consider myself fortunate that , uh , it never happened to me . 
now , i've never , 
i don't know what i'd really do if it did . 
what do you think about places , 
like i was in michael's the other night and charged something , 
and they asked for my home phone even though , you know , the charge had been approved . 
what do you think of that ? 
does it bother you to give it ? 
if i was the type of individual that , uh , had an unlisted number , i think i would be hesitant to give it . 
you know that uh , i believe it's a federal law that you do not have to give your phone number on charge tickets . 
one of the things that upset me when i lived in california was , uh , they did a lot of things with your social security number . 
security number , 
as a matter of fact , they even went to the point of printing our social security number on your driver's license . 
and they would not cash checks unless they had your social security number , 
so we had our social security numbers imprinted on our checks . 
uh , uhhuh . 
and i was really , you know , unhappy about that situation . 
i think that was an invasion of privacy . 
privacy , 
i can see , you know , where that was . 
i don't mind my phone number and address or work phone being given , you know , when i have to cash a check . 
i don't see any need for it when i'm charging something , 
i'm not going to give it to you , either .
you know , and , uh , 
one of the biggest things , i think that's going on in this country right now is the selling of , uh , mail lists and things like that . 
you know , uh , recently uh , i purchased some magazines , u s news 
and every since that day , i have been inundated with , you know , uh , subscriptions to this , subscriptions to that , uh , this news letter , this investment letter , uh , even to the point of people calling me at home . 
and prior to me ordering these magazines , i never got those kind of calls . 
i discovered with , uh , charge cards , uh , i feel like that i don't know whether it's the stores themselves that sell the list or whether the , uh , uh , credit report bureau sells it , 
but i get catalogs from people i've never even heard of . 
and i know they have to be coming from my charge cards , you know . 
from some list , 
from some list , you know , that knows that i have at neiman's or something 
because then i'll get catalogs that , you know , are within that range 
i get tired of that . 
because i look at all that junk mail , 
and i think of how inept our post office is and how that's taking up 
all their time . 
and they're not even paying full postage . 
you know , and if you did away with some of that , our postal service might give better service . 
i think the general public would be , you know , uh , tremendously upset if they knew how easy it is for , uh , let's say the criminal individuals to get access to people's records , uh , their credit cards 
uh , i don't think anybody really knows what to do about it . 
computers caused a lot of this , i'm sure . 
well , you know , let's face it , 
computers can be gotten into very easily if you're , you know , so inclined to , uh , oh , what do i want to say , have the smarts to be able to tinker with something like that .
they're very easy to get into . 
to tap into a system . 
seems as though they are , 
uhhuh , you know , 
and , uh , which is scary , 
i mean , you know , our lives are on computers . 
uh , and i don't know , 
i resent the calls of an evening trying to sell me something . 
fortunately , i uh , haven't , uh , been inundated with that situation yet . 
we are constantly , it seems like . 
i don't know why . 
you know , either wanting to clean our carpet , sell us storm windows , 
and i'd like to tell you first of all what's happening in our community 
all right . 
right now we have a pretty nice recycling program where a lot of the recyclable materials can be picked up the city along with your garbage can . 
uh , you can put out newspaper , 
you can put out glass , 
you can put out aluminum cans , 
you can put out certain types of plastic material 
and that is on a roll out effort right now . 
not all the citizens and the people in plano can go ahead and , uh , participate right now , 
but , uh , that will be rolled out to everyone , i hope , in the next year or so . 
and those that aren't participating , they have the specific drop off sites where you can take glass and newspaper and aluminum . 
and i think , uh , overall that's an excellent opportunity 
because i hate to see our landfills being filled up and , uh , growing bigger and bigger and bigger where they are becoming a big problem for not only the people that are living today , but for the future also . 
uh , i was read , 
how about your community ? 
my community , 
that's cute . 
i live in a place called dye mound . 
dye mound ? 
or dye community . 
and it's not a city , not incorporated , 
my nearest neighbor's about a half a mile at least , 
i can't even see their house 
and , uh , 
sounds like a place where i grew up .
i mean , uh , i'm out in the wilderness . literally . 
 well , i like it . 
and , uh , well , give you an idea , 
it's three and a half miles of dirt road to the concrete , 
we're out there . 
and , uh , i do some interesting recycling things . 
well , good . 
i'm building our house right now 
and i'm going to incorporate into my , uh , garage area a weight activated , uh , crusher . 
oh , okay . 
so when i drive the car the , uh , pressure side of a , uh , hydraulic cylinder . 
and the weight of the car will crush ,
hopefully , it's not my wife . 
well , let's hope not . 
you can uh , get in trouble for that . 
well , i thought an escapement type thing . 
i don't know if you're familiar with that operation , 
but , what you do is you just build up the pressure 
 and then you go over and release it 
and then it just drops , you know . 
well , you drive up on the jack , 
but it won't go down . 
until you release it . 
all right . 
i think , 
you know all that junk mail you get ? 
oh , yes , 
well , anytime they send me a return envelope 
because , uh , well , like i say , we live a way 
and when you throw trash away , you throw it in my yard . 
and i don't like that 
 so i don't do that . 
so i take it 
and i mail it back to them . 
well , great . 
that's excellent . 
i've had four companies actually stop mailing me stuff . 
 well , uh , if a lot of people did that , then we wouldn't have a lot of this junk mail . 
that's a great idea . 
i hadn't thought about that 
and we might be able to incorporate some of that . 
one thing , 
well , i think one of uh , or help the recycling problem is to eliminate non reusable items . 
for instance , uh , i saw a thing on , uh , nova , i think it was the other day . 
this guy has designed i mean recyclable items . 
whatever he makes , it's all out of the same thing . 
see , so , plastic , it's all out of plastic . 
if it's metal , it's all out of metal . 
he's a engineer , designing stuff . 
well , that's a great idea , 
uh , you know , your 
make it financially , uh , attractive to recycle 
 and somebody will find a way to make money at it . 
they will . 
well , there is a guy in dallas , 
that's all he does . 
he collects trash . you know , 
 well , that's a full time job . 
well , he's out for cardboard . 
well , i've found out , too , that , uh , you know , a couple years ago , 
we've always been recycling newspaper for the last twelve years , 
and at one time we could get a pretty good return , uh , with the boy scouts . 
we could take and collect the newspaper , 
so , are you a news person ? 
i enjoy listening to the news and getting as much as i can . although , you know , i'm a full time student 
and i work full time , too , 
so , or not full time , 
but i work quite a bit 
and so 
i like to listen to national public radio , uh , all things considered . 
great show . 
and i like to listen to that and catch , you know , 
uh , sometimes i don't get the current events , you know . because that show kind of has feature stories that might not directly deal with , uh , you know , some important issue on the day . 
the real current news and , the hard news 
that's right , 
yeah , 
i've had that frustration , too . 
you like n p r s , uh , programming ? 
uh , i 
uh , i subscribe to three newspapers . 
uh , you know , i sort of can't get enough of this . 
when i travel elsewhere , i'm often amazed at the local papers how little they have .
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah . 
well , what is the newspaper situation ? 
 , a big newspaper situation . 
uh , because , we used to have two newspapers up until , uh , last sunday 
and one of our major papers just closed down . 
we're done . 
the better paper 
or    , 
 it was a more effective paper as far as i was concerned . 
uh , uh , it got to the news , you know , and gave you the dirty facts pretty quick and easy .
for a different section . 
i like just to you know , find out what's happening 
and i feel that the other newspaper , uh , 
the dallas morning news is the one that's still here . 
the times herald is the one that closed up .
and , uh , is okay , 
but , you know , you have to wade through a lot of editorial garbage as far as i'm concerned . 
you know ,  , doesn't reflect my own opinion 
but if you were to look at the front page of today's morning news 
but , you see troy aikman's knee surgery on the front page , you know . 
whoever troy aikman is . 
for the cowboys . 
uh , you know what i mean 
change my life one way or the other . 
 so , uh , 
i guess it's current events , but not the kind of current events that changes the world . 
not something you'll , uh , be interested in ten years from now by any means .
how about you ? 
i rather like the washington post . 
but , i also get the new york times and the wall street journal . 
uh , and , uh , each of them covers different things dif , 
and so clearly would have a different perspective on the world . 
uh , i have a question . 
uh , does the wall street journal , uh , 
i've kind of gathered lately that , uh , maybe their information is not just only related to business . 
is that a correct assumption ? 
uh , they will have articles , 
like a few days ago they had a nice article on einstein , you know 
now , these are feature kind of articles . 
uh , you know , the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities . 
but there is some very good other articles 
uh , i wish it were in more depth . 
uh , that doesn't mean to say longer , 
just more facts would be nice . 
uh , c n n was pretty good during the war . 
oh , yeah , 
uh , and they for doing that reporting . 
it's never quite , 
uh , exercise huh  ? 
uh , as a matter fact , i work out in the mornings . 
i belong to presidents . 
and , uh , i have got a routine for every morning of the week 
and i don't work out on saturday or sunday 
 but , uh , i do a combination of , uh , uh , running and weight training .
they set that up for you . 
and i have been thinking about getting with see what , uh , they might have to offer 
but , i pretty much , uh , worked on my own routine . 
and , uh , what kind of running do you do ? 
they have got the track on the inside . 
and , uh , i run one mile on monday , wednesdays and fridays 
and then on tuesdays and thursdays , i run two miles . 
and then after that , i work out with weights . 
is just aerobics 
uh , i work out with free weights . 
uh , i mean the running . 
oh , uh , yeah . 
you do a mile in about eight minutes or less ? 
then you don't get , uh , out of breath . 
uh , no 
that is a pretty good clip 
and i am pretty winded by the time i get done . 
but , i mean it's not pushing it real hard , like , you know , if you tried to make six or something like that . 
oh , yeah . 
but then i would wear myself out .
and i wouldn't be able to work out anything else . 
how about you ? 
i don't run much any more . 
i did when i was in school . 
right now i just lift , uh , weights and do push ups and sit ups 
 and i , uh , jump rope a little bit 
 and that is about it .
and i don't lift any heavy weight , uh , 
they are about a third of my body weight . 
oh , i see . 
so this , uh , 
do you just try and keep them , i guess , uh , firm and , uh , 
and the , uh , the more upper body strength , the easier it is to play . 
uh , that is true . 
you have to do a whole lot of sit ups 
uh , and then , uh , i hurt my neck , uh , about three years ago . 
so , you really have to build up around your neck and your shoulders to keep from , uh , hurting yourself when you play high . 
oh , i see . 
you have to do it correctly , you know , 
it is like an exercise in itself , 
but a lot of people , uh , strain themselves doing it . 
oh , i see . 
uh , so you are part of a band ? 
oh , i see , 
i use to play an instrument when i was in high school , 
but it wasn't the trumpet .
so , i was just wandering if that was what it was or something . 
i think , 
so do you have any plans of maybe running more when the weather gets nicer ? 
well , yeah , 
yeah . 
i keep thinking about it , 
but that doesn't mean it gets done . 
i mostly jump rope more . 
you know . 
i use to do a little bit of jumping rope , uh , when i was , uh , 
well a while back i was more into basketball 
 and , uh , i could do a lot of jump rope and other jumping exercises to try to build my calves . 
uh , but , it has been a while since i have done that . 
i do a toe lift and squats 
but you know it doesn't , uh , doesn't , uh , accustom your legs to the kind of strength that you have like when you are running for a long time . 
they tend to tighten up whenever you have to do something 
uh , that is true . 
i have noticed that , uh , 
and it also builds too much mass if you just , you know . 
so , i lift weights with about the same curl weight as i do the squats with . 
and , uh , then it doesn't bother me very much . 
huh . that is interesting though . 
uh , i have been thinking of changing , uh , 
i have done the same routine for almost two years now 
and i am thinking of , uh , changing it up . 
uh , that is why , well , you know , i was thinking to talking to one of their counselors and seeing what different exercises they could get me on to , uh , get out of the routine . 
because i have heard that , you know , you get locked into a routine then you are going to get to a point where you just stop developing . 
so , i am looking at changing things a little bit . 
uh , i have started doing more push ups 
and it has helped a lot 
i don't try to push it so the end 
uh , clothing at work . 
um , i work as a news reporter , 
since i work in a small station , 
this is my first job 
 and so , i dress very variedly if that's a word . 
um , sometimes i'm shooting and doing photography , 
and so i'll be in jeans one day , 
and so i'll be in a suit 
and another day i'll come in 
and i won't know what i'm doing , 
so i'll wear a pant suit 
so , it really varies . 
i try to dress very comfortably . 
i don't really like dressing up at all . 
oh , me neither .
i don't wear a lot of makeup or anything like that . 
i just , 
i don't know , 
it takes too much time out of my day , 
and i don't know .
same here . 
i don't mind not wearing any makeup .
i don't mind it at all . um . 
um , i work at a bakery 
but , we have to wear white pants and , um , any color t shirt , as long as it's not like a bright color , like a pastel . 
white pants in a bakery . 
and we wear aprons and have to pull our hair back 
and so . 
what's the name of the bakery ? 
oh , italian i guess . 
yeah  , 
having to wear a uniform , because i don't have to buy , you know 
new clothes and stuff . 
that's one thing i would like , is i really don't like uniforms 
oh , yeah . 
that just bugs me to death . 
i know .
i do that every day for school .
oh , yeah . 
yeah , 
but i like to wear comfortable things like cotton and baggy things and . 
sweats and . 
yeah , 
when i was in school , i was a sweat monster . 
all i had was sweats , 
and when it was time to go out , i didn't have anything to wear . 
i know , 
i don't have very many dress clothes 
i don't need them yet .
um , let me see . 
i hate shoes . 
if i didn't have to have shoes , i wouldn't have them . 
oh , really . 
oh , my feet bother me , 
and they're just tedious 
to go find shoes for me , it's just , 
i don't know . 
i wear size nine 
 and i don't know if just the shoes i get , i either don't like them or they don't fit right , 
and i 
oh , wow , i love shoes . 
 oh , really . 
i always buy shoes .
just the opposite . 
but , um , let's see , 
what else do i wear ? 
um , when i do get into a bigger market , i'll probably go out and buy a bunch of suits and things , and , uh , where i wouldn't have to shoot and do a lot of other things 
and i could 
and so we're all , you know , still in sweats , really . 
so , it's pretty fun though . 
i like the like suit look , professional like , you know , look , 
so i'll probably just wear 
i like the , uh , suits with the , 
they come like with a mini type skirt 
oh , yeah . 
i like that , 
that is cute . 
i'm five four , 
and so that really doesn't flatter me , 
but i think it looks good on taller people . 
i'm five three 
and  , 
are you ? .
yeah , 
any time i go to the store , 
i mean , i have like two pairs of pants , because i can never find any that are short enough for me 
oh , really ? 
 and it's just , oh , ridiculous . 
pants , too , i could do without those . 
pants , shoes . 
i like the like stretch pants , the cotton ones . 
those are nice . 
they're really comfortable . 
with a baggy sweatshirt . 
and , tennis shoes . 
my boyfriend's got me these l a gear . 
they're kind of big and hefty tennis shoes . 
oh , yeah . 
and it's just like a chore to pick up my feet .
oh , yeah 
the little ones . 
i have a pair of those . 
yeah . 
and i'm used to those . 
they're just sort of , you know , 
like your feet 
 i mean , you don't feel them . 
you put these things on , 
it's , you know , like exercise or something for your feet . 
 and i have to wear them because he gets upset if i don't . 
so  , 
oh , yeah .
warm this time 
 warm . 
sweaters and . 
i grew up in new york , 
and so i know what warm is . 
like five pairs of socks and , 
yeah . 
yeah , 
sleeping in sweats or long underwear . 
my parents keep the house cold .
okay , um . 
i think , 
who has any spare time  ? 
i've got a six year old and a , um , 
well , my baby's one today . 
today's his birthday . 
and i'm expecting , 
and , so , i don't know , 
i haven't had much spare time lately 
well , i have had some because i was working for p i e , 
and they went bankrupt 
oh , uhhuh . 
and i've been making dolls , cloth dolls . 
oh , have you ? 
and , uh , 
you sew the bodies and everything ? 
it's not , uh , any porcelain at all . 
 and i make the clothes for them . 
what kind 
do they have yarn hair 
um , no , 
oh , uhhuh . 
i made some of them with that hair 
and then , uh , don't ask me what the other hair i made , 
um , it looked , 
well , i made some of them with regular wigs . 
oh , did you ? 
i went to the flea markets and bought , you know , like the wigs for a dollar . 
oh , uhhuh . 
then i cut a v shape out of the back of them 
oh , my goodness . 
it sounds like you're creative . 
they looked really cute .
uh , do you sell them ? 
oh , have you ? 
i bet . 
how long does it take you to make one ? 
uh , if i would just work all day long , making the clothes and everything , probably about two and a half days . 
oh , really ? 
do you enjoy it ? 
and , then i also crochet 
i can crochet and knit . 
um , actually , i started an afghan , 
but it's been a whole long time ago 
and it's   sitting in my closet half done right now , 
but , it's a knitting one . 
i tried knitting first , 
but , i don't know , 
i didn't like it . 
oh , didn't you . 
so then i went to crocheting , 
but now i want to learn how to knit again . 
i en , 
you know . 
i enjoy knitting . 
i kind of like that , 
but i just , like i say , haven't done it for a while . 
and i do like sewing sometimes . 
you know , just the little valence curtains in my house , and 
but , it's just finding the time for these things that you 
in fact , i just bought a serger in december . 
oh , i would love one of these . 
oh , that's neat . 
i haven't done everything on it yet , you know , 
but just what little bit i have used it for , i really like it . 
oh , those are wonderful aren't they . 
you know , especially making the seams and things like that you know , it's got such a professional finish on them . 
oh , yeah , 
and that's what i hate doing is the finishing stuff . 
it'd be nice to have that . 
so i like that . 
oh , that's neat . 
well , do you have , um , uh , 
i guess you're kind of young , 
i was going to say , do you have grand kids or anything to make dolls for . 
well , fiftyseven's not young , 
but no , 
but they don't have any children . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , i just make clothes for my dolls . 
 oh , well . 
well , how did you get involved in that ? 
you know , just like sewing and stuff and decided to buy a pattern and try to make a doll . 
so you did buy a pattern , and then started from there . 
 and they turned out really cute . 
you got to have a pattern for the body 
and , uh , 
have you ever seen those bunnies 
i did make some clothes for one of those 
aren't they cute ? 
 and most of them i have bought , um , already clothed , 
and i kind of made the pattern up . 
it's probably not the best 
but  , 
i bought a bunny pattern one time , 
but when i sewed it up , the face of it looked like a mouse . 
oh , it did ? 
see , it was too pointed . 
so i tore it back apart again , 
and i haven't tried another one . 
but i haven't made it yet . 
 uh , do you do any kind of painting or anything ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
i tried that , 
just a roller shade . 
but , i had a hard time stenciling . 
for some reason i just couldn't do it . 
oh , really ? 
and people have told me it's very easy . 
oh , yeah , 
my neighbor did it first 
and i seen her house 
and i saw how beautiful it looked , 
so then i decided well , i was going to do it , 
what design did you use ? 
uh , mostly flowers 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , what room ? 
i've done it in uh , all my rooms . 
have you ? 
i put it in the bedrooms and the bathroom , 
where are you , bob ? 
i am in plano . 
oh , okay . 
i am in waco . 
is that right ? 
oh , okay . 
right down the street . 
oh , credit cards . 
my favorite subject .
you mean you use credit cards ? 
i bet you used them all up over christmas . 
uh , i get in a rut with credit cards cause they get me kind of in a vicious cycle . where you use them a lot one month and then you have to use whatever money you have to pay those off 
and then your are in debt . 
 and so then you have no money , 
 so you use a credit card . 
i understand that . 
uh , i probably have one of every credit card there is . 
do you use them a lot ? 
i use uh , citibank , the , uh , advantage one 
once a year , i get a free airplane ride that way . 
so , as long as you pay it off every month , it doesn't cost you anything . 
well , that is a good idea . 
that is what i , 
but , uh , i got all sorts of credit cards for my business that i use 
but , uh , 
if i don't then it gets expensive .
that is my problem . 
i don't try and pay them off . 
i pay , like the minimum . 
well you shouldn't do that . 
i know .
 so i have got myself , 
you never get out of the hole that way . 
that is why i have got myself with all this trouble now . 
but , i pay most of them on time and everything . 
it is just the , 
i always have them . 
so , it is kind of strange . 
oh , yeah . 
can't never get out of debt . 
have they put the cap on the interest rates ? 
i didn't know if they actually did that or not . 
i know they were considering it . 
just the people who don't need credit get the four and a half percent . 
the rest of the , uh , and me , we have got to pay fourteen and eighteen percent . 
thou who doesn't need credit , gets cheap credit . 
i would be interested to find out or how much , uh , people use credit this year . say in nineteen ninetytwo as opposed to nineteen ninetyone , even nineteen ninety . 
how many more people use it . 
well , i think so 
because the , 
because of the economy . 
that's right . 
you have got to use everything you have got just to stay where you are at . 
i would like to see some numbers on that . 
i think that would be interesting . 
do you have any , uh , credit union where you work or anything like that ? 
do they have a mastercard or visa card ? 
you have got that one . 
who do you work for ? 
uh , i work for channel six . 
 it's an n b c affiliate down here . 
i do a lot of work down in waco , 
oh really . 
oh , okay . 
where do you work ? 
what is your , 
i sell metal fabricating equipment and tooling . 
oh , okay . 
tyme and mercury and tempco and all those people 
oh , okay .
uh gene he , 
so you probably work with , uh , uh , 
what is the boy from here ? .
you ever work with davis ? 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , what else . 
are you in the south part of town now ? 
oh , yeah . 
right outside . 
you know 
so , that is where davis iron works is . 
bobby parker and , uh , 
i am sure i pass by it or something , 
but i am not sure . 
there is a place in hewett , called , 
it is a new company called prime air . 
that is in hewett . just around the corner from davis iron works . 
huh . prime air . 
they make , uh , humidifiers and 
oh , okay . 
have you ever been to marlin ? 
uh , yeah . 
i think it is marlin or mart . 
they have , uh , uh , a place , i guess that would be similar to prime air . 
it is called h g h 
oh , really . 
i can't think of it . 
i can't think of the name . 
i will have to stop in there . 
i have gone through there , uh , 
my oldest son goes to a and m . 
oh yeah . 
he is working on his master's . 
the navy sent him there for his master's . mostly in engineering . 
so , once and a while we go up six there rather than take fortyfive . 
that is about the last time i have been through marlin and mart .
oh , i don't like that drive . 
i make that drive sometimes 
we have stories out there 
but , uh , 
there is always a state trooper down there . 
you have got to drive careful . 
oh , really .
i know . 
between mart and marlin , they will nail you if you go over sixty miles an hour . 
 oh , goodness . 
 they are bad at hewett too . on eightyfour . 
they are real bad . 
that is where i got my last ticket . 
so , of course , i couldn't pay that on a credit card . 
well , i was just wondering if you had had any experience with , um , the care of the elderly . 
in fact , uh , went to be with the lord , 
and we cared for her the last , oh , seventeen months of her life here at home .
and , uh , you know , those times , well , she was there in the regular hospital . 
and then she was diagnosed having inoperable type of cancer , 
and so the doctor elected to have her , uh , finish out , uh , in the hospice program . 
and , uh , the elderly parent in question is around their own family . 
the , uh , hospice program provides a hospital type bed . well , it is a hospital bed , and all the oxygen ,
well , that's nice . 
 and it's all taken care of by , uh , medicare , uh , 
and , uh , it's really neat , uh . 
 and to a warehouse . 
and that's what i basically , uh , view a nursing home as , a warehouse , 
so that's , 
pardon me ? 
it's really a sad situation . 
 and , uh , i think a lot of people struggle with . 
  oh  .
is that right ? 
well , that's really sad . 
i know . 
but , uh , in this case , uh , spouse and i , uh , are , uh , united in this area because , 
in fact , uh , her , uh , uh , experiences were invaluable 
uh , in fact , i don't know if i could have , uh , held up , uh , you know , without my wife , uh , helping 
well , i remember being a child 
and my grandmother had had my parents tried to keep her in the house , 
and they did for a long time . i couldn't , 
  and so   , 
and it was really hard on everyone . 
she had to have , you know , twentyfour hour a day care . 
and i don't remember much about it except that there was a nursing home at that time 
and um , they put her there , 
and we all went just constantly until she died . 
oh , okay . 
but it was very hard on everyone to see , you know , grandmother be like that , 
and being so young , i don't remember why . 
well , maybe , well , was just such that such mom and dad couldn't handle it . 
well , i do remember that she was , you know , totally incapable of taking care of herself in any way . 
oh , boy , 
 and they found that they could not 
well , no , uh , uh , choice left to her then .
but like you say , there is a tendency for people to be abandoned , though , you know , 
i do remember the other patients there , uh , being real excited when we came to see our own grandmother , because they got some interaction with someone . 
in fact , and be interested in what they have to say 
and i guess that's hard on people to give up their lives . 
if they're busy they don't you know . 
it's easy to abandon people , because we do have the nursing homes , i guess . 
if you can afford them . 
but , anyway . well , i'm , 
 and then , 
oh , yeah , 
it did , 
and that we were able to , uh , have , uh , uh , 
so what do you you in your lawn ? 
do you do it yourself 
or do you hire someone to do it ? 
uh , no 
and oh , i find that i have the time , 
and i kind of enjoyed it over here in texas . 
i used to live in arizona , 
and it was very frustrating , because i didn't have the watering system 
and it was just too much work 
but over here we get enough water you know , naturally as well have the automatic sprinklers , 
well , we do our own out here , uh , you know , mow it ourselves and everything , 
but , uh , our water supply right now is bad . 
we need rain badly .
oh , that's right . 
uh , here in patterson , i can water on tuesdays , thursdays , saturday and sunday , four days a week . 
is that enough during the hotter times of the year ? 
uh , now if we don't get some rain , they might limit it to not even four times , you know 
 but , uh , yeah , 
we do our , you know , mowing ourselves and everything , 
and i do our planting of bulbs and things where i can have some spring flowers 
 and , uh , 
i find that i've been doing a lot of perennial planting , which i never did before 
 and it's been real enjoyable , although i didn't do any this last fall , because our past winters have been so cold , um 
and by the time the flowers would come back to life it was supposedly the time to pull things out for the spring and summer planting .
so i was getting kind of disillusioned and tired and spending too much money on something that was kind of more of a problem than it was rewarding , 
we have quite a few roses . 
in fact we just pruned them way down , 
and i just had to replace one of them , 
so i just bought that yesterday , 
and i'll probably go outside today and plant that . 
but , um , i like to have the roses where i can have cut flowers all year long . 
those are enjoyable . 
i even had , uh , roses on my table for christmas dinner 
oh , did you ? 
but , um , other than the roses i don't have too many flowers . 
i plant gladiolas 
um , those are nice . 
 and those are always pretty , 
but they get so tall , 
and they bend over so fast 
i haven't done much in bulbs . 
in fact i received as a christmas present a planter that had bulbs in it , that we were supposed to go ahead and water it any time and after it started to sprout put in a sunny window , 
and it 
but i don't have any flowers on it . 
i don't know how long that takes , or 
it's just nice and green right now .
well , is it one of those amaryllis ? 
uh , no 
no , 
oh , okay . 
and , uh . 
do you have a big yard ? 
and in plano and most of the newer areas of texas , uh , they have just the minimum square footage for lots , to where you get a little bit of a backyard , 
we have a pool in our backyard , 
but it's , um , you know , very small . 
but most of the houses here , if you have a pool , you don't have anything else in the backyard 
 that's about the size of most of them . 
so , uh 
well , that makes it nice . 
well , it's hot enough here in the summer time that we could have a pool , 
but we don't have one 
but they are a lot of people that do have pools around here 
 but um , 
uh , yeah . 
so we do have a garden , you know . 
it's just a small one , you know , 
but we , had lots of tomatoes , and , uh , zucchini 
it's amazing what you can get out of a little 
 you know , it's probably about i don't know , twenty by six , something like that , 
and it's amazing you know , how many plants you can plant in there 
 but it was nice . 
few cucumbers . 
that's one part of gardening i haven't tried yet , 
um , i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten , i guess ,
and i think there should be limitations of , like semiautomatics . 
uh , things like that should not be just given out to anybody . 
in fact , you know , i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose . 
those would be fine 
but when you get into a lot of the more complex weapons , i would say yes 
we need to put restrictions on them .
 uh , i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think . 
uh , i definitely think that like you said , rifles and 
for selfprotection , 
for sport . 
but i personally cannot see any use for them 
i can't imagine that . 
to do massive amounts of killing , uh , 
the only thing that i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is , uh , uh , you know , going to kill a massive amount of people or , uh , somebody that's escaping , that's , uh , very dangerous 
semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and , uh , get him down . 
but , uh , you know , i think of my family . 
uh , they're very much into sporting as far as hunting and also like , uh , clay pigeons 
so they may have some shotguns . 
they may have other type of , uh , hunting type things , 
but i figured if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody , more than likely , somebody would see it , you know what i'm saying 
that's true . 
and nobody would see it , 
but yet , you can't stop people from having , you know , a handgun in their home . 
and people without small children that may have grandchildren , you know 
uh , so i don't know if that makes a difference or what 
the criminals would get them . i mean even if they had to go across border to get them . 
 and are , are being punished 
how as 
because we had guns all over our house when we were kids 
and not that they were laying on the , uh , couch or anything like that 
 but , uh , i never had an interest in them ,
 and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns 
 and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy 
 and , of course  , we were quite young 
and we went through ,
if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun , you're going to learn how to do it correctly 
and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and 
but yet have this ,
they have to have a certain respect for it . 
well i grew up in a family 
and my father had two guns 
 because he used to hunt years ago 
and i knew we had the guns in the house 
and , the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time 
  it was just something you knew was there 
 and it was your father's 
and played with at all 
the thing that should be , you know , stressed . 
i think so 
and i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what  , 
so , do you have the long , 
i guess not , not if there's , 
see i was raised in new york , 
do you . 
we live on a , 
used to be a farm , 
but we don't farm much , 
uh , but we do have a garden . 
huh . see i got mine in , 
well , let's see , 
i put in pepper plants this weekend . 
i wish i could be doing that .
i got all my little seedlings coming up in the kitchen 
and , i enjoy tinkering with it ,
it's pretty hot down here during the summer , 
we hit , you know , a hundred , hundred and two sometimes , 
but , you know , we don't do too much during the summer , as far as tomatoes and stuff ,
you almost have ,
but then i have to wait for my , 
tomatoes have to go in here in the next couple of weeks 
as soon as we're , sure we're not going to have another freeze ,
you've had more freezing or this , yeah , winter , i think . 
more bad weather . 
and it's pretty tough . 
do you work , 
or are you retired 
or you , 
i'm only forty years old . 
i have to work , 
uh , my husbands retired . 
but he's not a gardener . 
he's been helping me more , 
but he really isn't , uh , real crazy about gardening . 
uh , i really enjoy it , 
it gives me time outdoors , 
and , you know , i'm a golfer , 
but , it gives me time outdoors , and time around my house , 
and i , burned my grass off here in the last couple of days 
i usually have a pretty nice lawn , 
it's a lot of work 
oh yeah . 
but it's , 
but like you said , it's good to get outside , 
it is . 
we have just a small garden , 
but we planted corn last year too , which takes quite a bit of space 
we didn't have too good luck with it , 
because real good wind storms , 
and it really damaged the corn 
oh yeah . 
 so we didn't get too much corn ,
we're going through that , 
we going through the dust storms down here now , 
uh , uhhuh . 
a two by six frame that's five by ten . 
i have two of them sitting side by side 
 and then i put , uh , like , a black plastic , 
it's really not a black plastic . 
they call it  wedet  
 and i put that down , 
and then i put up a couple of inches of pine moss on top of that 
 and i use one of those black poker hoses that actually oozes water every where 
 so i waste it up and down there a couple of times , 
and i only have to water about two hours a week 
oh that's great . 
 and it's pretty nice . 
especially during the summer , it keeps everything wet ,
we don't usually cover ours . 
we did a few different times 
  sometimes we've covered with the plastic , 
and other years we've tried newspapers 
we do our watering from our spring . 
oh you have a spring , 
how nice . 
we have an old fashioned pipe sitting , that , you know , water runs into 
it runs first down 
and then it stops , 
oh that's , 
and when the water comes up , it comes on again , 
and we use that to water our garden  ,
do you ? 
get out there on your hands and knees ,
i'd rather be doing that , than housework .
i can imagine . 
you all have much trouble up there , with insects 
i think our cabbages , and broccolis and that we have more trouble with , that type of thing , with the , 
with the worms ? 
yeah . 
i have quite a bit of problem down here with the squash bugs ,
do you go more for keeping them off naturally , 
or do you ,
i try not to even use insecticides on my lawn , 
well , our lawn , because we live out in the country , 
and so our lawn is not perfect , you know , 
it's just the 
well , mine's full of dandelions ,
do you eat any of them ? 
i don't know how to prepare them . 
oh , a hot bacon dressing , like for ,
oh it's delicious 
and it goes real good on dandelions . 
i've never eaten dandelions 
now i've tried dandelion wine 
 but i've never tried any dandelions just to eat . 
  use the greens , if you get them when they're young and tender , you know , before they have grown too , 
because they do get a little stringy . 
all right . 
but , uh , they're kind of fun to try , 
get a few 
and then throw them in with the rest of your salad sometimes . 
i'll try that . 
i sure will .
uh , but i've been cutting our grass too lately because my husband's back , 
and he's been having trouble with 
so , wasn't allowed to run a lawn mower , 
oh , oh . 
so , it takes about four hours to cut our grass . 
and , we have hills . 
i'm afraid of the hills 
so you all are into , 
i just pretend they're not there , 
and i just go ahead and do it .
yeah , 
well , i guess i got 
my whole section of my house is probably a tenth of an acre 
then i have a pretty nice backyard , 
and you know , i've got enough room to throw horseshoes .
oh , that's great . 
a lot of people don't have that much space even . 
and it's nice . 
i'm just inside the city limits , 
i'm probably a mile , mile and a half inside the city limits , 
and i'm only a mile ,
so you have all the conveniences of ,
it's pretty nice . 
and the country also . 
i have the room outside i need , 
and i don't really have all the room in the house i need 
 well , you never have enough room do you think .
i have a question to ask you about gardening though . 
you know , those , 
what are they called , 
they called , uh ,  rolly polly  bugs , 
that's what my son calls them anyway . 
 rolly polly  what ? 
 rolly polly  bugs . 
the ones that roll up in a ball . 
i don't know what they're called . 
is it a bug ,
they look like they've got , 
a worm ? 
a cutworm ? 
not a grub worm ? 
it's not like a , 
and if you touch them , they roll up in a ball . 
i don't know what they call them . 
but i'm plagued with those things , 
and i haven't figured out , 
i even called the nursery , 
i'm trying to think of what they are , what kind ,
you find them under bricks usually , and that . 
under bricks , or under wood , 
or you know , if you leave a piece of newspaper in the yard too long , they get in there . 
they usually come out at night , 
but , you can find them during the daytime if you pick something up that's   been laying around , 
they're not a slug . 
not a , 
a slug is actually kind of slimy 
 and these are just , 
he plays with them all time , 
he picks them up and rolls them across the patio . 
oh really . 
are they a hard worm ? 
they're not a hard   .
they're like a , water bug ,
i don't know what ,
but they roll up . 
i can't think of what kind they would be . 
when you touch them , they roll up . 
i'm no help on that , then . because ,
but , i'm plagued with those . 
i think you have a lot more insects down there even than what we have . 
you know , i think it's a big problem because we're in more of a tempered zone . 
you know , we only freeze down here in january , and february , at the most . 
i know ,
you know . 
i got fire ,
uh , yeah . 
and they be can be a real dickens . 
and , you , spray in one part of your lawn , 
and they just move to ,
so you got to ,
and your neighbor gets them , 
and then he sprays his yard , 
and you get them back again .
you keep trading them .
but we're not doing too bad down here really , you know , 
the daffodils are out 
ours are going to be coming out . 
now our cancer society sales daffodils . 
they're big now . 
so , we have daffodils ,
but they're just beginning to come out and bud . 
see mine are up and bloomed already 
they sure are ,
i like them    , 
uh , they're such a nice bright early spring ,
and then in my back flower bed i have , uh , tiger lilies 
 and they bloom in , you know , 
and they're ,
they are . 
they real ,
they're nice and green , you know , 
uh , they're up above a foot ,
 oh my . 
they come up real pretty ,
we won't have too much here for another couple of months yet . 
is it still pretty cool up there ? 
well , do you all have a , 
what kind o grass do you grow up there ? 
do you grow , uh , bermuda or    , 
we really didn't plant anything . 
it's just , 
  i suppose maybe you call it crabgrass even . 
and , uh , 
see i have bermuda ,
and i still have the old standby crabgrass here and there , 
it's probably ,
we have some people that have done their lawns , 
and , uh , 
okay .
where do you like to camp ? 
how do you like to camp ? 
oh , i can camp just about , most anyway .
camping or , uh , motor home is nice , uh , travel trailer , pop up , 
i used to , uh , live in the ozarks and , uh 
oh , really ? 
you really rough it then . 
do you do that very often ? 
but i used to do it 
you'd have a lot of hills down in that area . 
yeah . 
it was real hilly . 
that would be really great . 
take a twentytwo 
and go out . 
and find a creek . 
that sounds like it'd be fun . 
i used to go with my brother . 
we just lived up there . 
oh , that's great . long as it's not raining . 
it gets kind of , 
we used to have one of those little caves you can go back in 
oh , that would be , 
but i don't know much about camping in texas . 
well , i'm in pennsylvania . 
you live in pennsylvania ? .
i didn't know they did this . 
are you in texas , now ? 
i'm down here at t i . 
most everybody i've been talking to is from texas , 
but , uh , we're up here in northwestern part of pennsylvania . 
i used to be in ohio , 
it's some pretty country up there . 
well you kind of know what it's like , then . 
but , uh , we've done , uh , many types of camping . 
we've done tent camping , 
and we had access to a motor home which is really super great , if you don't want to rough it too much . 
they have some nice camping grounds 
just set it up 
and get out of the city for awhile . 
just get you away from the everyday things that are going on . 
ocean most every year . 
and that was fun 
we stayed mostly in state parks 
and , uh , we really enjoyed that . 
tell you what , 
oh , maybe dropping my phone . 
is that better ? 
so what , 
you try to go and take a vacation every year and go out and camp ? 
we don't as much anymore , 
but , uh , we used to . 
we kind of slowed down a little bit . 
but , uh , i think the worst thing is when it's raining . 
if you get a rainy season and you happen to be camping 
i know the rain bring out the snakes or used to bring them out in the ozarks , 
that's kind of rough when you got to fight snakes off when your sleeping . 
i don't think i would like that . 
what kind ? 
uh , copperheads mostly , 
those aren't too pleasant . 
we have some of them around here . 
you probably have more there , though , i would imagine . 
one year they were just everywhere . 
i don't know what it was , 
we had a real rainy spring 
 and then it was all year , 
there was just copperheads everywhere . 
but you still backpacked and camped out . 
and we had to pretty much hike out most of the time . 
if it rained we were stuck back in there . 
had a four wheel drive . 
you just get used to it . 
i guess you know enough to look where you're walking or sitting 
could have problems like that , too . 
it was small 
it was more 
is your brother younger than you 
well , that's great , 
that'd be a lot of fun . 
you have a lot good experiences from that . 
it was . 
saw a few bears 
did you really ? 
what , black ones ? 
yeah . 
 that would be exciting . 
the first couple of times it's pretty scary 
but , uh , 
they're usually more afraid of you than you are of them , usually . 
but , uh , 
they're on the increase in this area . 
oh , really ? 
i don't know if , 
 oh , do they ? 
uh , they've had longer hunting seasons than that even to get rid of more of them , because they were , uh , increasing so much . 
they stopped for awhile 
or they really made it hard to hunt them . 
i don't know what it's like now , 
i haven't been back up there in awhile . 
but , uh , we really like camping . 
we really have a lot of fun , a lot of memories in that from camping 
and , uh . 
well , it's good to get out and smell some fresh air , too . 
so , it's a lot of work , too 
it's , uh , you know , getting ready and taking care of everything . 
but um , it's really refreshing . 
well , i think we're about to run out of our time . 
i think so .
well , it was really good hearing from you 
i'm sure , i will . 
thanks a lot , 
and you have a good day . 
you , too . 
so , uh , do you think russia's still a threat ? 
well , i guess i'm maybe naive , 
there you go .
i mean , obviously the possibility of , or , was the possibility of war , uh , 
but , i somehow think that war is one of those things that maybe is inevitable , 
but , uh , i don't look at it as a threat in the same sense that i think this question was meant . 
what about you ? 
well , i think , 
have you ever read the book nineteen eightyfour ? 
you know , like , how , uh , there was like three continents that were always fighting with each other 
and you could picture it as being russia versus the u s 
and what they would do is they would get their prisoners and kill them as soon as they got them because the people there could realize that they were the same as themselves , you know , 
the prisoners of wars were the same as the people living in that country . 
and you didn't want that to happen . 
and to me , it had always been that way . 
i mean what happens is , you have a government , right , 
and this government controls everything , right 
 and then you have the people inhabiting the country 
and these people have nothing to do with the government itself . 
and these people are the same as you are . 
and what goes on is that every time somebody attacks a country , supposedly u s or russia attacks a country , it's not going to be within the borders of the u s or russia itself . 
like i was telling people , i'm really mad because the whole thing in the middle east this was going on . 
they were announced to be a separate country . 
but , yet , the government that's in moscow told its army to go in there and get those people 
and the u . s . didn't go in there and try to save those people . 
there's a separate country . 
because you're going into the border . 
once you get into the border , then there's a threat . 
but what happens is you don't mess with us , we won't mess with you , 
but let's mess with the neutral countries . 
you know , and now i guess , other leaders were still crazier about it , you know , 
like other people , you could think that they might use a bomb here and a bomb there , 
but russia has never been known for throwing an atomic bomb anywhere . 
and the u s has . 
you know , do the job with , uh , you know , less suffering . 
you know , but the thing 
like they were saying they go , you know , 
like libya could start a nuclear war because of whoever is behind the button . but not the u s s r , 
the u s s r 
but i guess there was concern , uh , that with the chemical weapons and things 
but yet it didn't happen . 
i mean 
i mean you can imagine the first , uh , chemical weapon used 
that would have meant a total attack of the iraq country within , you know , three hours of when the weapon was shot . 
oh , so you think it was fear that kept iraq from 
but , yet the , 
and what happens is , 
suppose they get saddam hussein , which they eventually will , 
he's got one less thing to go against him . 
i mean , if he were to use that , he might as well commit suicide 
if you give up , then you can come live in our country 
and we'll take care of you , like marcos , right . 
we'll overthrow you , 
but yet you can still come live here , you know . 
i don't think we've done that to saddam hussein yet . 
uh  , no . 
i think that's not very likely . 
but yet you know , as the parallel russia is that saddam hussein is using the chemical warfare 
and i guess that makes sense what you said that , uh , within their own borders they feel freer to do 
and , uh , you know , there's just , you know , 
like like the u . s . goes and goes into panama 
and what , 
see i don't believe in war . 
that's my thing . 
i don't believe that anybody should die 
and so then , you know , you have , 
because what happens is , 
suppose i go to war 
and i'm holding a gun 
and i'm just looking at myself holding a gun 
and whoever shoots first survives , you know . 
but that same person also has a family 
and , you know 
and , you know , life ends there 
and to me that's ridiculous . 
you know , i mean , i just don't believe it . 
i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't , 
but it's pretty hard to think that , you know , people are just going to shoot each other down 
and it's legal in a situation like that . 
you know . 
i mean saddam hussein lost so much money during the war that it was ridiculous 
and all he was trying to do was make money at the beginning 
but , well , 
well , it sounds like neither one of us thinks that the soviet union is a real threat to the u s . 
i think , uh , they're especially getting their life back together now 
because a lot of things that you saw on tv , 
a lot of , uh , inhabitants of russia would love to stay in their country just as long as they were able to express what they wanted to . 
a lot of like dancers and stuff like that . 
they said that they wouldn't leave russia unless russia told them that they couldn't travel anymore and compete . 
so it must be a beautiful country . 
it's just that , you know , they won't let you get out 
and when you want to get out of the country , that's what you want to do . 
so , oh , well , 
i got to go to class now . 
well thanks . 
nice talking to you . 
this is jim in dallas . 
uh , how you doing ? 
i'm callie in garland . 
oh , you're right here , 
i'm actually working tonight , 
i just , uh , called and came in . 
oh are you . 
do you work at t i ? 
i know , 
well , i haven't got a chance to look at them yet . 
it was a lot nicer than i expected . 
oh , yeah , 
we are . 
do you have anybody that you , uh , are close to that decision on , or anything , 
or , i've thought about it for myself and all , 
and my wife's mother is in a retirement home . 
she's not in a nursing home . uh . 
oh , well that's a , 
did we , 
but , uh , she's 
now , what , 
 and uh , it's a brand new one . 
it's a catholic , uh , retirement home for nuns . 
it's at , uh 
let me see , trinity , 
i keep calling it trini , 
it's not trinity , 
i'll think of , 
incarnate word , 
and they have a retirement home for the nuns 
well , isn't that neat . 
 and they take some lay people . 
isn't that neat . 
and that one's really super . 
now i know what they're talking about on regular retirement . 
there's not too many , 
they do have a wing where the people who are really sick , you know 
oh , that's good . 
and then they have other wings that we visited , uh , that are very nice . 
i mean it's just super . 
that's neat . 
just supervised more or less than anything and security , i guess . 
oh , yeah , 
we've been there once at night at christmas . 
she just went in last year . 
she drives and everything , 
she's perfectly healthy . 
or what made her decide to go ? 
well , her husband died . 
they were in the military together , 
and she just did not want to take care of the house 
 and she visited the place , and then fell in love with it , and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind ,
and so 
well , that's good . 
and they   serve meals , of course . 
that's great . 
they have clubs and a swimming pool , 
so that's nice . 
now i know the ones where you're really ill , we visited a long time ago when 
and they were all more or less hospitalized type 
shutins and , 
it's a tough question . 
it really is . 
i worked in one as a teenager . 
i volunteered , 
oh , you got   more experience than i do then on it . 
well , it was really sad , heartbreaking , i guess . 
and , uh , oh , i just felt for those people , especially the ones that never got visited . 
 oh , that would be awful . 
that just bothered me . 
i never thought about that , you know . 
that just bothered me so much , especially , you know , at my age , 
i was probably about fourteen . 
and that really made a bad impression on me .
i always thought , not really bad of them , i mean , because most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people , 
but , i don't know . 
it would be a tough , tough decision . 
i think that , uh , hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it , 
and they're getting nicer . 
i've seen on t v where they take animals and young children , 
in fact my daughter is one . 
my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school , took them to an elderly home , 
and boy that really pumps them up . 
that is very nice to see young people . 
i think that's one of the sad things , is when you're in an older home . 
if you just have people your own age , you never get a chance to see kids or anything 
you can't take care of them , 
kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals 
but it's nice to have them visit and everything . 
and get that youth back . 
you know , sometimes that even helps them , just being around young people to , because some of them are so , um , just stationary 
 i mean , they'll get in a wheelchair 
or they'll just sit in a chair 
and , until you come along and really try and pump them up , they're just stationary , 
so i do , love to see young kids go and men take the pets and everything . 
i think that's a real , real neat idea . 
i think you do get more by stimulation . 
in fact , my mother in law just visited . 
she's just about seventyfive . again , perfectly fine . 
in dallas . 
every time she goes back to , uh , san antonio , my wife has two sisters there , too , she said she's much better , 
she's much more alive and , uh , active when she's been on a visit 
 and our routine has   obviously hectic with teenagers and everything 
 and she's much , 
and so the stimulation part is really important . i think , like any animal , anything 
you just lay around , uh , that's the fastest way to die , i think , you know . 
that's exactly right . 
i think they're really neat . 
um , of course i've seen those reports on t v , the horrible ones 
oh , yeah . 
 and that scares me . 
i'm afraid i'm a t v flipper . 
anything bad , i like to ,
but it's sad , 
it's sad to think that we would do that to people , 
and you know , i've seen them on t v with , uh , bed sores , 
oh , yeah . 
these people have given so much of their lives , you know , to america 
and here is how we treat them . 
just put them in a home and leave them . 
when i was , uh , younger , i lived in the east , 
i'm from the east really , 
and it seemed like there were several people that i knew that had their , uh , parents , i guess they would be , but well in their seve , 
living with them . 
and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old , 
and i guess she had her own separate room . 
and i think , whether it's more a custom up there , or maybe because i was younger 
 and it's just not a custom anymore to have , uh , you know , the grandparents live with you anymore . 
i guess that , uh 
i think , 
i think it's neat . 
i think , uh , you learn a lot from them 
oh , yeah . 
and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories . 
oh , right , 
i think that's neat , 
because they really have a lot of good insights 
he had him late in life , 
and he'll be eighty this year . 
and uh , he lives with different , you know , people in the family . 
he'll switch from time to time . 
i just , 
well , that's nice in a lot of ways . 
i just couldn't imagine locking , 
not locking him up , but putting him in a home and just , 
bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake . 
lock him up . 
that's what i think about it for me , 
i know , 
i don't want that , you know . 
let's put these old folks in a home , 
but when i think i don't want to do that , you know . 
i don't want to be 
that's right . 
i'd want to have my little home . 
i always threaten my daughters , 
but i'm not going to one of those places . 
oh , you're going to put me away . 
that's what my mother , 
she always , 
you're going to lock me up one day , aren't you . 
i can tell , 
you're going to lock me up . 
that's the way we call it , which is really wrong . 
i know . 
but my wife's mother , she's in san ant , 
it's everything but . 
the opposite of what you've seen . 
i mean 
that's great . 
again , a swimming pool , and grounds , 
and she has enough room . 
she has two bedrooms , and a 
they don't have kitchens or anything 
 but it's like uh , on each floor they have a little kitchen area 
prepare your , 
well , that's great . 
now can she leave , um , on a day by herself ? 
oh , yeah , 
it's like living in the hotel . 
i mean 
oh , man . 
that's neat . 
uh , and she still drives , which does scare us some , because she has dented a few things , you know , 
and we keep thinking about that , you know 
 because they get less alert , 
and they don't care , 
and i've seen some of these elderly people on t v you know , the ones from florida that just run into people 
and they don't even 
i know , 
bless their hearts , 
you hate to hurt them by doing that , 
i know . 
and you take away that driving ability 
and that would really be hard . 
i know . 
go ahead , 
i'm sorry . 
oh , he still drives ? 
well , it's wonderful in one respect , 
but i don't know if you can afford the insurance , 
so , he could get hurt . 
i just hope to god he doesn't ever hurt anyone . 
but he 
that's good . 
i mean , people are all different . 
just to see how well they are every five years . 
i saw that on twenty twenty . 
are they doing it ? 
they're , you know , thinking of doing that . 
and i think that would be a great idea , because i think they do , become less aware , 
and they don't hear as well , for one thing 
 and that doesn't help . 
well , everybody needs retraining . 
it doesn't hurt , uh , 
the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches , 
and i don't know why you couldn't after sixtyfive every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving . 
would probably help pay for some of that , you know . 
at least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away .
there you go , 
there's a good point 
it's on the state .
very good point . 
but i think they maybe , should do that , 
and then the families , 
have you noticed any new , uh , trends in politics ? 
and did you hear yesterday that mayor bradley said that , uh , he should ? 
oh , really ? 
i think what's interesting is that , uh , the political activists , jesse jackson and a lot of other people went out there and are demonstrating . 
i find it interesting that , uh , outsiders would bother to go in . 
how do you feel about people like jesse jackson getting involved ? 
uh , i think sometimes it's good for people outside . 
they get a different uh , perspective on an issue and stuff . 
so , yeah , 
i don't see any problem with outsiders going in and getting a little bit involved . 
well , do you 
i think , though , that it should still be , uh , sort of up to the majority in the area . 
i don't know , 
on something like that , they wouldn't really vote on it or anything , though . 
and he obviously failed somewhere along the line . 
well , speaking of that kind of issue , have you kept up with john wiley price ? 
what do you think of him ? 
oh , um , i think he's got good intentions , 
but i'm not sure if the way he goes about what he does is really right . 
he's an interesting person . 
i was talking to someone who said that , uh , for all his obvious efforts to get media attention that he actually is a worker on the , uh , 
i guess he's on the county , uh , oh , board of supervisors or 
   and , uh , at those meetings he really comes quite well prepared and is well informed and is a hard worker 
and that this stuff we see you know , in the media is , uh , 
well , he's really just trying to make a political statement . 
is a , you know , 
of course , he's got in this  deal  of racism and the , you know , name calling and all this . 
but apparently , he's a , a worker . 
uh , you may disagree with him , 
but i find this whole , 
what do you think of this , uh , fourteen one and ten four one in dallas ? 
oh , i think that they should go ahead and go to the , uh , fourteen one . 
to me it's just fair , you know , 
it seems like every area should have an equal voice . 
i agree with you 
but did you see the map they drew up uh , on how they were going to divide up the districts ? 
it was the strangest , 
i'm not sure it was gerrymandered , 
but the way they drew these little patterns and stuff , of the power base . 
uh , why they don't go with fourteen one . 
uh , i think it's hispanics don't vote because they don't think that they have any affect , 
and it's , 
i guess i am disappointed with dallas in that , uh , the fourteen one , it , 
i don't know . 
you can disagree with al lipscomb and , uh , 
what's the lady's name ? 
diane ragsdale ? 
but in reality i think they're trying to represent their constituents . 
and i think dallas is doing itself a disservice . 
i think they ought to get on with something important . 
they really make themselves look bad , 
and i don't know why certain groups are fighting so hard to keep the ten four one . 
even those people are , 
it's like pauken and box and these people , 
i think it's kind of interesting that everybody's so busy politicking that the question is are we getting anything good done . 
it's like this whole school issue . 
are you involved in the schools at all 
and it all seems , you know , like everybody's trying to oneupmanship on everybody else 
i have got to run to a meeting . 
it was good talking to you . 
i don't think we've gone our ten minutes 
but i think we've talked long enough . 
good talking to you . 
good night . 
well , there's been a lot of publicity lately about that new nancy reagan book out by , uh , kitty kelly , the unauthorized biography . 
are you interested in that at all ? 
i'm not much of a fan of nancy reagan , 
so i don't particularly read , um , biographies or autobiographies . 
i haven't read too many . 
not of that nature though . 
well , the reason why i was thinking about looking at it is because it's supposed to , 
i'm not a fan of nancy reagan  , 
and so it's supposed to have a lot of unflattering things in it . 
and i thought just purely for entertainment , i might enjoy that . 
but i wouldn't want to go out and buy it like , you know , the hard back copy of it . 
but i might check , 
if they had it , i don't even know that i'd probably read it even if it was at the library though . 
you know , i'm just not really interested in reading about other people's lives to that degree . 
you know , unless maybe they lived a long , long time ago . 
for me it would be interesting to find out what life was , uh , like , you know , in that period . 
in biographies . 
well , uh , 
i prefer to read , 
if i read a biography , it's mostly because maybe i have to , uh , you know , 
back when i was in school i had to have information about that person or , um , preparing some kind of lesson 
and i need to have more information about people . 
but i do like to read some biographies , 
but that one just sounded like gossipy . 
and i wouldn't want to sit down and just read it cover to cover , but flip through just to get a good laugh . 
i think the last biography that i read , it was , um , on lady randolph churchill ,
and that was excellent . 
was it ? 
um , yeah . 
it's in two parts . 
i think the first one is called jenny or something like that , uh , because that was her name . 
and , um , 
and i've been looking for , you know , the other half of it and read the , 
i read that half where she was in her later years , 
and it was absolutely excellent . 
and it was very descriptive of people with money back then and , uh , affluents in england , uh , that , you know , were associated to the king and all . 
and it was ,
 , and that was actually a couple of years ago , 
a while . 
 uh , i love to read . 
i mean , i'm constantly reading . 
i like , uh , mysteries , 
and i like , um , 
as far as improving myself , uh , i haven't read any lately . 
but i was reading classical works that i hadn't read before .
 and you have so many out there you know , you never get a chance to read . 
and so , i said , 
well , i think it was because i read , um , dickens' a tale of two cities , 
and um , that , even when i read it now , it still makes me cry , the ending of it . 
 and i could not believe that it took me so long to read such a good book . 
i'd read some dickens before , 
but i hadn't read that one . 
something's excellent about them , whether it's the way they were written or whether it was the material you know , that was written about . 
um , so i started reading . 
you know , i had a binge of bo , 
my mother , uh , 
i was living in bermuda at the time with my husband , 
but my , uh , mother sent me , you know , like you know , uh , boxes full of different books . 
and , uh , she just would get them real cheap and stuff and send them over . 
but was , i guess because , 
it seems like , uh , older people have much better , uh , 
in their schooling , they got more of the classics than i did ,
and she knows so much more of them than i do , 
i wouldn't even know , you know , to go look for that author or that book . 
you know . 
well , i like the classics too . 
uh , i think that there's a lot of books out now that are kind of garbage books . 
and uh , well , like at a target or a supermarket or something where they have a bunch of books out , paperback type books . 
usually , i'm going to the book store for a particular reason , uh . 
probably you read a book review or something . 
a review on it . 
and , uh , i buy some of the , not selfimprovement books , but , uh , selfhelp books 
like , we just bought a new house , 
so i bought a couple of books about how to buy a house and what to look for , you know . 
i bought that for my husband .
how to do something books , you know , for reference . 
uh , and those are really helpful i think in helping , um , 
well , you know , like some , how do you know when to take your child to the doctor or not ,
but purely just for enjoyment , 
i had a major in english and linguistics , 
and so i have a lot of books in my home that i can read from the classics , 
and i do enjoy those quite a bit . 
for reading just day to day , uh , you know , i have a particular book i'm looking for 
or i just enjoy , uh , you know , the newspaper magazine . 
it's handy . 
well , what i do is i usually have two books at one time . 
i have a classic which i have to work on , basically ,
well , some authors i can just , you know , basically drink in , 
 but others ,  eh   , i really do have to work at them . 
and then , um , whether , you know , they're a foreign author or whatever , um , or if it's their style or just understanding the material . 
and then some of those , it's like i said , 
it's like school , 
you have to work at it . 
but to me it's worthwhile in the end . 
i feel good about it , 
and i usually remember those a long time later . 
and then i have books that i read just purely for enjoyment ,
light reading . 
 i mean , yeah , 
just light reading that are , 
i particularly like dick francis books , and just some of you know , just , uh , purely for entertainment ,
that's it , 
i'm not really expecting to get anything out of it ,
well , i think that's good because you do have to use your mind and imagine up the circumstances and things . 
it's not like , uh , most television where you can sit there and not even pay attention very much but ,
television , it gives you everything . 
so , it's basically mindless . 
i mean , the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you , you know , 
but they give you everything else . 
 and it doesn't even have some of the underlying , uh , things to it , you know , that maybe the old movies and things had , you know , the underlying themes and stuff that maybe you had to kind of figure out . 
or , you know , like with hitchcock or something where you're either expecting something or w , 
i don't know , 
i don't really care much for t v at all . 
i just , 
i mean i sometimes get hooked into it , 
but i realize fully there's no really redeeming value for ,
not too much . 
not too much . 
well , that's right . 
well , i think it is good like you say , it's light reading , you are still getting some , uh , mental exercise .
you're developing your imagination . 
you know , when you develop your imagination , that can take you into a lot of other areas , because you've developed , uh , in seeing things , you know , 
you're taking words and developing a picture in your mind . 
that's right . 
so , i mean , 
that's good . 
we haven't got children yet , 
but i hope to , uh , set an example for ours it can be your best friend ,
 i mean , even if you haven't got and , 
i think so . 
well , i guess i'd better close now so i can , 
it sounds like your kids are doing stuff .
or are you a teacher ? 
i gathered you might be a teacher . 
i'm home now ,
 uh , so , yeah , 
we think books are important around here . 
well , you have a good day . 
stay out of the rain . 
you too . 
take care . 
um , how do you feel about , um , the way the u s has reacted in the middle east ? 
i think , the sanctions would have worked , 
but it would of taken longer 
and , uh , now with all this stuff coming out with woodward's book and everything . 
uh , and then i saw a nightline program last night about all the funding of hussein's , uh , back as early as nineteen eightysix , 
so , uh ,   been a different turn , 
and then i don't think we projected what was going to happen after the war , 
it got over so fast , 
so , uh , 
what is the woodward book you are referring to ? 
well , it just came out , i guess , yesterday . 
it's called the commanders . 
and uh , uh , an early , uh , 
he was for sanctions . 
and so it seems like there's , you know , always some body digging things like that . 
but , i'm not for sure we know exactly what all happened in that situation , 
so , we were so , uh , fast to get over the vietnam , whatever the vietnam syndrome is , that now we've tied ourselves up there in the middle east for a long period of time . 
that was my feeling . 
i was very against our involvement so quickly . 
uh , they could have made sanctions work , i'm pretty sure . 
with that much support , you would have just penalized any nation that broke the embargo , 
i think we're very naive as far as that part of the world is concerned . 
we are . 
for the next thing down the road 
and we don't tend to read israel correctly 
so , uh , i don't know , 
it should be a mess . 
it's , uh , not going to be anything we're going to get out of very soon . 
in spite of all the promises . 
they can talk a good game , 
but , uh , being a historian , you know , you read all that clear back at least to the turn of the century with all the mess after the first world war , 
and you're absolutely right , 
too naive , 
if we do find socalled experts in any area of the world , we don't listen to them 
be interesting to keep watching i guess , 
but i'm just afraid it's going , 
and i'm not sure we're sensitive to other cultures . 
not very much in our colleges , 
we're trying , 
i happen to teach at a college with a tremendous number of international students 
and cultural diversity is just something we really don't understand 
and it needs to be , uh , taught from the earliest grades , 
with our school systems in such disarray , i don't know , it doesn't look terribly hopeful . 
but i'm not sure it's something you can teach . 
i mean , 
well , you can at least , uh , 
when those people are around 
and you can get them to meet 
and we're all pretty much alike , 
that's true . 
so it will be a good topic for me in the class for along time .
because i teach history , 
and , um , what about the whole situation with the refugees , the kurds ? 
well , i would just think if bush was so successful in lining up the correlation to prosecute a war , then he should be equally successful in getting that same correlation to push the united nations to , uh , uh , somehow persuade those nations to give the kurds a homeland 
they were promised that   .
but , what about the palestinians ? 
well , that's the same thing , 
uh , they haven't been waiting quite as long , even though they've been waiting since fortyeight , 
 uh , that becomes a different matter simply because your dealing with israel 
and they seem to be more intractable than ever . 
uh , that shamir if he backs down the slightest bit 
so , uh , like the great statesman of the past , 
 or at least we thought they were . 
i'm not for sure that they were . 
they seem to have gotten us into some of these messes . 
well , do you think the u s should even be involved ? i mean , as the world leader in the sense trying to resolve these issues 
or should we have just stayed out of it ? 
well , i wish we could stay out of it , 
but the oil is not going to allow us to . 
we absolutely need that oil . 
that's the major thing . 
if we didn't need the oil and if we didn't have the ties with the israelis , we could probably stay out of it . 
but i'm not for sure that we're not destined , at least for the foreseeable future , as long as we can keep our own head above water , to be the world leader . 
so bush is probably , if he can keep that correlation together , especially the french , and the british , and the germans , and be sure that the japanese can kick in some of their money . 
they may just have to , 
i don't know what type of pressure they can put on all the nations there , too , because now that the war is over , societies have just about gone back to their own ,
and i wouldn't have necessarily fought for the kuwaitis , 
nobody likes them in that part of the world 
but , uh , it's just such a volatile area , 
i mean , there's just no stability , period . 
but in a sense , i don't know that i would say it's good , 
in a sense i'm glad that saudi wasn't more changed by the situation 
 so the fact that the saudi could just sort of pull back and , uh , remain , you know , culturally sort of clean is interesting . 
i think you're right . 
it's not our , uh , role to make everybody like us . 
but , it's just , uh , for those who may have wanted to travel in that part of the world that are up in the age i am , it's going to eliminate that for awhile . 
i think it's going to be too dangerous to be any place in there . 
well , you know , i mean , i actually lived in beirut from sixtyeight to eightyfour .
oh , did you ? 
and so , i mean , it's been   dangerous for sometime . 
i'm not sure that it's changed that much . 
well , i haven't been to beirut 
but i've heard what a wonderful city that , 
it's just totally gone to , uh , 
well , see that's it . 
it really hasn't . 
it hasn't   .
it depends on whether one talks physical or sort of cultural . 
culturally , i mean , it's obviously changed a lot . 
because it's more of a  survival city   , 
but the buildings are still intact and still beautiful , you know , you know . 
there was garbage on the corner when i got there 
and there's garbage when i left . 
but i mean , it's just a different cultural aspect . 
i mean , the trucks don't come daily 
and you really don't want the garbage in your house , 
and , i mean , i traveled in the area , too . 
um , so that many of the countries turkey and syria are the same as they were for traveling . 
that's one part of the world , 
i've been to north africa a lot but not , um , 
i haven't been to beirut or syria or baghdad , 
i was never able to go to baghdad . 
i never could get a visa . 
so even when things were good in the middle east , americans weren't really given visas to go into baghdad . 
it's a very beautiful part , very interesting historically , of course , which was my interest   art history . 
so , uh , 
well , i think we've done them a good job today then .
in fact , i just talked to the director awhile ago , 
so , uh , he was checking to see if i was going to stay in because i've been so busy with this presidential search , 
i haven't had a chance to ,
i see . 
so , uh , 
then great 
and , um , you know , have a good business trip . 
thank you . 
and you continue   .
thank you . 
i think we're terribly taxed . 
i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats , 
and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other . 
uh , i think we get a lot back , 
but not as much as we should . 
uh , i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that there's got to be something . 
for the debt , instead of using the money for where 
what kills me is when they had a chance the glen , rub , 
what is it , uh , the act where they had to cut everything across the board 
the gramm rudman act . 
 they kept putting off doing that . 
why did they do that ? 
that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together . 
well i think they spend too much . 
they spend too much on themselves , too , 
oh , yeah , 
i think so too . 
well . things like mailings . 
they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things . 
they just think once they get there that they can do just anything . 
you're right . 
and of course , here at home , we end up conserving and conserving 
and , i mean , when i don't have money , i don't buy something . 
i think , uh , it is the congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money , uh , 
they sure don't seem to . 
the national debt is terrible . 
there are a couple of things i think we need to really work for , 
and i don't know quite how to do it . 
but i think we need to have the one line , uh , uh , veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything . 
if it's a good idea 
 oh , yeah . 
 you know , and if it's not , so what . 
at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months . 
i saw one on twenty twenty about a month ago i guess , whereas one , i think that he was a senator from pennsylvania or something like that . 
maybe it was , uh , connecticut , 
i'm not sure , 
one of the small states up there , where he had a bill through for uh , a drug agency that would be located there , 
and he was the only one that wanted it . 
was going to cost millions of dollars . 
the drug agency didn't want it , 
and he was going to build it in his home town 
and they were going to hire a lot of people , 
and it was ridiculous , you know , the whole thing .
that's right . 
 and , you know , they asked him about it . 
do you really need this ? 
this is going to cost a lot of money . 
oh yes 
we need it . 
but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this ? 
and they do things that are , you know , just like the , uh , 
that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on . 
 and the trouble is , you have so little input about it . 
you don't know 
they're supposed to do what we say , 
but they do what they want to do with it . 
that's right . 
 the other thing about is i think , uh , limiting their time in office would be good . 
i just 
we need to get that through . 
two terms is enough for all of them . 
uh , whether you're mayor , all the way up , city council , the works , i think . certainly president , that , uh , two terms is plenty . 
i think that's right . 
 and then we get these professionals out of there , 
and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves , you know , rather than 
wouldn't that be too bad .
well , that's right . 
i think , 
i don't know , 
i think , uh , people in general , 
to exist is so outrageous that it's not 
 you know , it starts at the courts , 
it starts everywhere 
well , it's so much money 
and you can't even add it up , you know , 
that's why they think , 
when you talk about the trillions of dollars 
our national 
i mean and you just , 
the other thing is , other people , 
and i think we need to do that . 
but they need to put more limits on them . 
they need to restrain 
foreign aid , 
foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely 
they've given that away for fifty years . 
unless we can afford it , 
if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again . 
i agree , 
you know , i don't really mind helping people , 
but that's just , uh , eating us up 
the magistrate 
but the government does it , 
and it's all right . 
every thing . 
i don't know what's the best way to do it , 
but , uh , they don't even talk about that . 
they just raise it . 
they don't even consider it , like you saying 
that's true . 
 well , sounds like . 
they are at least doing something now , with the military , you know , 
they're cutting some of that , 
but of course , now , you know t i , 
you know that's hurting us although , 
it's good to see them doing some things there anyway . 
but t i has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else . 
and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic , uh 
but , uh , that's the only good that i've seen congress do , you know , and everybody 
i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens , we're going to have to bite the bullet . 
and we're all going to have to do it . 
it just isn't fair , though , that when this happens in some places , it needs to all come off everywhere . 
that's why i thought , well , you know , this is the time . 
they need to put that they've got to cut costs . 
the only taxes i think that are well spent , 
well not the only , but , uh , 
i don't understand the present school thing , 
but , uh , i have two daughters , 
one's in college already , 
and one's about to be in high school . 
but uh , i think that paying for schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime . 
and so i don't mind paying for school 
i think that's right . 
 well , for positive things that are helps , like roads and 
but , um , you know , you just feel like it's out of control . 
you feel like 
the spending is out of control . 
and so then it just aggravates you , you know , 
i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing . 
oh , i agree with you . 
so it's , 
i think that's a wide open subject 
people need to take a stand . 
i think the people will here shortly , uh . 
well , i think that's right . 
if they don't pull it in and start doing something , i think they're really going to have to i think . 
i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out , too , what they did last election , 
and , uh , ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in , you know , 
so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes , you know . 
they're supposed to represent us . 
that's what they're called 
 but they don't . 
maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there , guys and gals whatever they are . 
in some ways we're awful lucky i guess . 
there lot of places where it's worse than it is here . 
i know , 
but it . 
that's right , 
you don't want to , 
you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be . 
we need to things be honest 
and , i guess , in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes . 
but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent . that they're doing something that's positive for 
uh , i don't really feel like i use taxes very much .
i don't know 
you're right . 
i guess i do . 
i use them in roads and lot of things , 
but , uh . 
well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex , uh , in the last say twentyfive years or so , maybe longer , they've built all these dams . 
you know , the corps of engineers get another one . 
and we've had droughts here in long summers 
we've had good water supply , 
and that's due to the corps of engineers looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us , you know . 
they've done some good things . 
the state actually did some in that a couple of years ago . 
uh , sam johnson came out and talked to us about that 
and some good work . 
i think anything for water supply like that . 
california should do more of that too . 
there are a lot of places where they're in real trouble , 
they just finished joe poole lake over here , 
and they need to start another one . 
i think every time they finish one they ought to just have 
the water's critical . 
 that's probably right . 
 the growth is fast enough so that they can't afford to just dawdle and wait until something 
well , it's good to talk to you . 
oh yeah , 
are you a t i er . 
just a housewife . 
 oh , well , great , 
guess i like to talk , that's all .
 well , it's been some interesting subjects , 
thanks for calling . 
bye now .
 well , did you get a chance to watch any of the games ? 
uh , no , 
and that's about it . 
oh , okay .
did he get hurt last night 
because , uh , i saw just a little bit of the game today 
and he was out there playing . 
oh , okay . 
although , uh , what i saw was at the end of the first quarter , 
i think he only had like eight points 
they thought that was big news . 
oh , yeah . 
so , i don't know , 
but i don't know who won , 
and , uh , i don't know , 
who do you normally pull for , the mavericks or , 
oh , yeah ? 
and , uh , what is it 
he's in trouble again down in houston 
and , uh , they said the other night his contract is so big that if anything happens to him , you know , if they don't trade him , they'll have to pay him off , you know . 
so they're rather have him , except that he gets in trouble all the time and falls off the wagon , and have some chance of him playing , you know , earning his money . 
oh , jeez . 
because that's just dollars right out of the franchise . 
sure is . 
oh , man . 
now i've always been pulling for the lakers for a long time . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , 
they're consistent . 
but , uh , when they had , uh , akeem 
now they kind of got caught up with a lot of the other players and , uh , course , uh , all the people that follow the lakers and everything out there in california . 
uh , and it also helps when they were winning .
well , they play better as a team than anybody else , seems like . 
uh , i  always  wondered that , you know , 
i will take a look at the individual score , you know , in the individual stance in the n b a 
 and , you know , they have in the paper , you know , like fifteen different categories 
and the highest scorer , the top rebounders , uh , assists , foul shooting percentages and all that , 
and you go  down  through 
and virtually every one of the categories there isn't , uh , a laker in the top ten 
usually hardly anybody in the top twenty except for , like , magic 
 and , uh , yet the lakers continue to win . 
so , you're right , 
i think they do really play much better as a team than they do , uh , uh , each one , you know , individually at their spot .
but , uh , 
year in and year out , it's not like they have , you know , 
a lot of teams will win in the playoffs 
and then the next year they'll be all 
well , i understand that , uh , 
i guess boston's really , uh , giving , uh , 
aren't they playing detroit ? 
i think boston's playing detroit 
and i think they're really giving them a run for their money . 
except larry bird's hurt . 
did he get hurt again ? 
i tell you what , 
i guess it's tough to play that many games and still stay healthy . 
they play two or three times a week . like , you know , 
and then they go on road trips 
and they do the same thing 
and then they stay out for two or three weeks at a time . 
so , it really gets , you know , 
i mean they're sleeping in different bed every night 
he said the other night on the news that he hadn't done any extra shooting for six weeks , 
the three point shot 
oh , yeah , 
matter of fact , i watched him , uh , on t v , you know , sink , i don't know a , 
jeez , it was like , uh , uh , thirty five baskets in thirty seconds or something like that from three point range . 
 oh , i don't know , 
did you ever play much basketball ? 
just playing horse and stuff like that . 
yeah , 
because it kind of a violent game . 
it really is for a noncontact sport ,
 and they d , 
and they don't wear any pads   .
i figured , 
some of those guys got pretty funny looking , uh , eye wear . 
they have to wear goggles because they get hit in the face with elbows all the time . 
well , i was looking in the paper for something on it 
and here's the top n b a draft prospects 
and , uh , i mean they're all the size of football players , you know , except they're just taller . 
several years ago when i was up in , uh , cleveland , i was staying at the marriott 
and the cavaliers were playing somebody . 
i think it was like utah or somebody like that 
and , uh , i was down by the pool 
and there was all these guys standing around about chest deep in water . 
now i wear , uh , contacts , 
and i had my glasses on 
and i went down there and just jumped into the water where they were 
and it went right up over my head 
and i came up spittering and sputtering for air 
and they were all the basketball players there to play the cavaliers 
they were all like , uh , like six eight and , uh , you know , six ten , 
and they were standing in water that was like six foot ,
six foot , 
and uh , it was funny , i tell you . 
i saw a guy , 
i don't remember what his name was , 
but he got on the elevator 
and he had his swimsuit on 
and , uh , he was just skin and bones , you know , 
it looked like something out of africa 
 and , uh , i made some comment 
so , you're right , 
those guys really , you know , the big ones , 
i don't even know how much ewing weighs . 
but , uh , he's got to be way up there . 
oh , yeah . 
well , here's a guy from l s u , stanley roberts , 
he's seven feet tall 
and he weighs two hundred and eighty pounds . 
god . that's a lot .
that's a lot of guy coming down on you . 
i didn't even see , 
uh , the best , uh , draft picks ? 
it doesn't even say . 
here uh , it says 
this is for underclassmen for june twentysix 
 and , uh , they , uh , have a lottery on it . 
they pick numbers 
and that's how they take them in order . 
oh , yeah ? 
it must not be according to how they did during the year . 
i used to go down to reunion arena , uh , 
went down there a couple years on the day of the draft 
 and that was really pretty interesting . 
they usually have , uh , uh , you know , a video , uh , highlights of the season , you know , and basically kind of walks you through what happened to the mavs and who they traded for and how they did and a lot of good footage , both the good and the bad 
i don't know , 
i didn't go down there last year , 
but , uh , it was only like a couple dollars to get in 
and it was really kind of interesting .
uh , so who do you thinks going to win the playoffs ? 
i don't know , 
who's going , 
is it chicago and , 
think chicago's playing philadelphia 
and then the , uh , 
shoot , i can't remember them all now . 
utah , portland , boston and detroit . 
that's the n b a ? 
philadelphia was , uh , favored by one point over chicago and the lakers one point over golden state , and detroit by five over , uh , boston .
i think boston will win . 
think so ? 
i tell you what , 
those guys really hang tough . 
now , i'd like to see them back up there again . 
uh , uh , of enjoyment and fun and everything . 
have you ever been up there to boston garden ? 
oh , no , 
well , i don't know 
is that in , 
i haven't really gone to a lot of games live , 
but boy i'd sure like to . 
basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun . 
how's the weather been out there ? 
well , the last three days it's been pretty rainy . 
we went to the beach 
 and , uh , it started , uh , let's see , around four o'clock , 
and , uh , it had thunder and lightning , 
and then , you know , it was just overcast and rainy for , uh , the next two or three days straight . 
how about yours ? 
it's pretty normal for this year , you know , uh , 
they have tornados about once a week , 
and it rains about every three days . 
the last two years before , they've had record rainfall . 
by this time of the year they'd had enough rainfall for the whole year , 
but this time we're only , um , i think , maybe five inches ahead of , uh , normal . 
so it's not been bad at all . 
you're from virginia ? 
and , uh  , 
i heard they had some flooding down there . 
um , they had some flooding in houston the other day , real , real bad 
the radar just looked nasty 
well , the last couple of years , um , we're over as far as our rainfall goes . 
before that it was really dry , 
and , uh , 
not really rationing water , but just cutting down . 
and , uh , 
  there y , 
but it's , uh , changing latitude . 
so you get a lot more rain that way . 
oh , yeah . 
brings in that cold air 
and mixes it with the warm air coming off the atlantic ocean . 
that's what , 
it's finally cleared up . 
it's just now still a little overcast , 
but the sun has finally started popping out . 
is the temperature like sixties to eighties there too , 
oh yeah , 
um , i'd say it's at least seventynine , eighty , well , about seventyeight , seventynine degrees . 
um , do you get east winds a lot of the time from the ocean 
uh , uh , blows north east , 
you're right , 
it blows north east . 
that's the way it does here most of the time . 
but , uh , sometimes it just comes straight from the north 
depends on how strong the cold fronts are . 
how far are you from houston ? 
um , well , uh , richardson's a suburb of dallas . 
oh , i see , 
from the ocean . 
well , uh , it's kind of early f , 
i was going to say , the weather man on , uh , one of our stations was talking about the way that the weather's doing now is like tropical weather , 
and he was afraid if it kept doing that , that they'd have early hurricanes this year . 
um . well , we've had some , you know , pretty rough winds . 
oh , uh , they caught it bad .
kind of wiped them ou , 
but we'll probably have our share of the hurricanes . 
i know , uh , hurricane hugo , 
you probably heard about that . 
uh , last year . 
wiped everything out . 
and they're still , uh , rebuilding from that storm , 
and so the beaches here just get really beat up 
and it usually comes this way .
it comes up from , uh , miami 
and it usually travels , uh , northwest , 
and , uh , it'll go up the coast quite a ways before it finally hits . 
do you get many tornados this time of year 
um , let's see , 
two years ago we had one , 
as a matter of fact it went within a mile of my house . 
and , um , it was real odd . 
the barometric pressure drops during a tornado , 
and our , uh , fire alarm went off . 
so of course that woke everybody up , 
and we knew what was going on , to , uh , you know , go downstairs or go into the bathroom and , uh , take cover . 
but , uh , we get , uh , 
and , uh , the , uh , uh , 
there's just hills . 
we're about two hours from the beach . 
so , uh , you know , uh , barometric pressure i believe is higher in the mountains , 
and you know , a few winds coming off of them , i think . 
but , uh , let's see , 
you all just had a tornado , uh , over close to oklahoma and texas ? 
they had a huge one that was on , um , inside edition the other night , in , uh , the southern part of kansas . 
um , they took a bunch of film of it . 
it , uh , kind of chased them . 
it was a few hundred yards away 
and it chased them under an underpass , 
and it was tossing around the car 
oh , gosh . 
and it tore up the people inside the car . 
oh , did it ? 
and the camera man on the news crew held the camera out , 
they were hiding underneath the underpass , 
and he held the camera out as the tornado went by . 
and you know , it had a mike on it , 
and the wind and everything was incredible . 
um . boy i would have like to have heard that . 
that would have been something . 
i'm surprised they didn't , because we saw it on the news a couple of days in a row 
and that was way up in kansas . 
but over here , it's a big thing about tornados and people that get pictures of them . 
i used to live in amarillo originally . 
so i'm , 
you can really see them well there . 
oh yeah . 
 and the only time we got worried is if it hit the ground . 
but otherwise we'd just sit back there and watch them go in and out of those clouds . 
it's really strange the way it does that . 
especially the way it starts . 
it starts , you know , just like a little swirl in the clouds , 
and , uh , then it just grows from there . 
and usually it's not even raining when it starts . 
it's just . 
you'd be amazed at how clear the sky was , 
but the clouds are just really , uh , uh , rolling 
that's right , 
and they're black , 
and sometimes they're even green colored . 
oh , well i was in that , uh , big tornado went through wichita falls . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , the sky , 
i mean , we were right in the middle of it , when , i mean , signs and telephone poles were dropping all around us . 
and a whole roof of a restaurant came off . 
and , uh , it was uh , a real eerie bluegreen color . 
and the lightning was almost continuous , just , uh , you know , as if you put your hand on one of those electric , uh , things that causes lightning . 
uh , i think it was called the storm . 
that's it . 
but , um , the whole sky was full of that eerie bluegreen , uh , lightning . 
and sometimes all the way through june , 
one of the junes the last two years . 
and this year , 
we usually get about five inches in may , 
and it's over that . 
we haven't got that much rain , 
but , uh , when it rains , it's been downpouring . 
all right , 
well i hope you have good weather the rest of the summer . 
you , too . 
have fun playing tennis . 
um , do you have any advice for college ? 
i'm full of advice . 
i'm still a graduate student . 
uh , the main point that i have about choosing where you want to go to school , is that , you have to early on define what it is you want to do 
uh , i had the unpleasant experience of going through several schools that were very specialized . 
i went through a number of them ,
oh , that's interesting . 
i went to a liberal arts school , actually , at first , 
and um , 
and then by the end of the second you had to pick some sort of major , 
but until then they didn't sort of force you . 
they sort of forced you to run around taking classes in everything until then . certain requirements , 
so that you had to sort of get a general feel for everything , 
so it wasn't that specialized . 
so that , 
that's wonderful . 
i'm a great proponent of liberal arts education ,
uh , being an engineer now , i believe in it even more strongly than i did before . 
i was just on a committee recently , actually sponsored by , uh , the american association for the advancement of science , where they were just trying to figure out how to fit science and liberal arts together , you know , because there are people who are getting just wonderful science educations and not getting enough liberal arts , 
and then the other way around as well , 
people are getting pure technical science educations and not getting very good liberal arts sorts of issues . 
well , thus far it's working to my advantage . 
uh , the great gap historically except to another engineer . 
and i have the ability to listen to them and then translate that into something that nonengineers can understand . 
well , that must be helpful . 
  that could be very helpful  .
well , i figure that , that's probably the thing i would most tell any parent , you know , to tell their kids , i think , probably 
make sure the kid goes to a school where they get sort of a general education 
and save specialization , i guess , for graduate school , unless they're sure early on they want to do something like engineering or something . 
or they can , 
even at that , i have a son , who's only nine at the moment . 
but i see him very rapidly becoming the engineering personality , 
and , uh , if he decides to pursue that , i'm going to insist that he spend two years at a liberal arts college , before i'll even let him go to an engineering college . 
and , yes , 
that'll add one year to his education experience . 
but that's a good idea . 
well , where i am right now , 
actually i'm at the university of rochester , 
and that's a pretty good engineering school , i think . 
i think 
it is . 
they also have a fairly large liberal arts college as well . a sort of , a separate , you know , arts and sciences college . 
um , and i believe the engineers are sort of required to take classes in everything , 
and uh , i do work in language processing , 
an electrical engineer student , and then switched over at some point into language processing , because he found that he enjoyed it more . 
so they do force them , 
people are forced to sort of take all different kinds of classes here , which i think is wonderful . 
oh , i agree . 
uh , i have the experience , uh , 
the last school that i went to was mississippi state university 
uh , the typical land grant university , 
every state's got one . 
anyway , while it has both engineering and liberal arts , the engineering students tend to cluster together . 
you know , they're in classes together , even when they're outside of the engineering department . 
and they don't learn the communications , 
they don't learn the thought processes of other fields of endeavor . 
and got to make one rule .
um , uhhuh . 
that would , 
you don't need any philosophy at all in school . 
or so , 
or some other thought provoking area , you know . 
very true . 
uh , when i went to undergraduate , we had uh , 
went to brandeis , 
don't know if you know of it or not , uh , 
we had , uh , uh , a requirement freshman year of just humanities . 
then you were given a choice of , um , you know , 
there were ten or twelve , or whatever , or fifteen different courses that you could take , 
but they all came out of philosophy , english , and literature departments , 
and they were a set of assigned readings everybody had to read , you know for , 
so the first year humanities courses everyone had to read the iliad and so forth , 
and what they did do , was they all approached it from very different , 
so that you could have one class in the philosophy of something , a literature course or , just all sorts of different perspectives on it , 
and people got to pick and choose , 
of , sort of how to think about these things nonscientifically , you know , 
uh , and that sort of forced them . 
but i believe was , i was sort of forced to take lots of different kinds of courses . 
um , i was forced to take , i think you know , some sort of art history course , 
and we all grumbled about it at first , 
but then , afterward , we all wound up taking extra art history classes , because it just seemed like something we didn't totally know nothing about , but just enjoyed very much doing ,
that and , uh , extra music classes . 
that i notice , 
like i talk to a lot of my friends at school that are more specialized , 
and they don't have that . 
you know , they went in and took their courses that they were expected to take , 
and that was all . 
they never had some of the more fun classes , i guess   .
i feel a little more worldly now .
well , that will continue to grow even as you go beyond graduate school . 
i'm hoping , i'm hoping . 
have you gone straight through ? 
and i just went straight through . 
um , i'm finishing up next year . 
so , yeah , 
completely outside my area , 
and i'm finding in graduate school it's a lot harder , because , uh , i just don't have the time any more to sort of sit in a course , that i'm not getting graded for . 
whereas before i would just sign up for credit for it , now i can't sign up for an art history course for credit necessarily . 
so i have to try and go myself , 
and i went for like two or three weeks and realized , not enough time for the work unfortunately . 
that's true . 
i'm pursuing a doctorate in psychology . 
so , i'm just , wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead . 
uh , what else . 
i think i , 
i first enrolled in college in nineteen sixtysix . 
uh , six years , an undergraduate degree . 
and then fifteen years after that , i got the first of a set of master's degrees 
and four years after that i got another master's degree . 
um . you had real world experience in the middle there . 
oh , yes . 
 or that was , 
it certainly makes acceptance of different ideas a lot easier . 
um . yeah , 
i'm getting some of that . 
um , i have sort of some ,
my wife is not an academic at all . 
my wife is sort of in the real world , 
and so i sort of hinge halfway out in the real world 
and getting , you know , real world   .
and i never would have had , 
she's the office supervisor , 
and her business as well . 
so yeah , 
so i can see where that might be a , 
well , vicarious learning is a wonderful thing . 
it certainly means that we don't have to experience everything , 
but experience is a wonderful ,
that's my , 
oh yeah . 
well , i'll take that   and think that through a little bit . uh . 
my wife , as i may have mentioned , just finished a doctorate a couple of years ago . 
and she pursued her education along the lines that i did 
and she feels reasonably comfortable teaching now . 
she has an awful lot of experience to draw on . 
no longer  , 
well , i take it since you selected this topic that you have children . 
you don't ? 
but i have nine younger brothers and sisters . 
my goodness . 
 so . well , i have two daughters 
and , um , they've been latchkey children for a while , 
and they're almost where i can start saying they're , you know , young adults , 
so i don't have to worry about child care too much anymore . 
i would assume you know , if you were looking for a daycare center or something like that . 
well , if i were look , 
or probably even babysitters would be the same thing . 
um , i think my top priority would be that it would be someone who would be responsible and someone that would actually like children . 
i would think someone older 
and i would want to know if they've had any past experience with children . 
uhhuh . 
and i think that varies . 
i think a lot of your criteria vary with the age of your child . 
that's true also . 
um , you know , really qualified 
um , with a baby , definitely have to be someone who knows how to handle a baby and would know how to respond to an emergency . 
well , um , i did a lot of babysitting when i was younger . 
i'm twentytwo now 
and i did most of my babysitting when i was between the ages of thirteen and sixteen . 
but , um , the only thing people ever asked me , 
well , of course , they knew i came from a family with younger kids , 
but they really didn't ask me if i was used to children or not . 
the only other thing they asked me is what i would expect in pay . 
oh , uhhuh , 
you know , and , um , i was pretty surprised because if i had a child and someone , you know , i personally would ask for people that that person has babysit for before . 
well , when i grew up 
and , um , coming from , you know , that background and the background as a parent now , i think the reason that people don't ask a whole lot of questions is a lot of times babysitters , 
i know i did this with my children , 
you get somebody where you kind of know the family already . 
and that gives you so much basic knowledge that you don't ask a whole lot of questions . 
because i had three younger brothers and sisters myself 
she knows how to treat children . 
well , see my first babysitting job was pretty strange . 
um , this lady saw us at church 
and you know , she was a younger lady . 
she didn't really know my mom . 
she knew my mom by name 
and that was it . 
and , um , she knew that i was one of the oldest girls in my family 
so she just asked my mom if i could babysit . 
you know , she really didn't know my name or anything , you know , 
i thought that was pretty strange . 
you know , and she had two children . 
one was still in diapers when i started babysitting . 
so , um , she pretty much , you know , just assumed that i would know , you know , how to handle them . 
so , you know , i enjoy kids 
and i get along with them very well 
so there's no problem . 
but , uh , with today's world and the kids today , uh , i can't say that i would just ask someone , you know , that i didn't know like that to babysit . 
oh , i agree with you , 
but there again knew of your family , 
that's true . 
and she met in a safe setting , such as church . 
so she was going on those two instincts . 
just the same i know myself , 
i never , 
and i was very very protective on who babysat my children . 
oh , i would be too .
it really shocked me 
because just about six months ago someone came to my front door , rang the doorbell . 
she had just moved in the neighborhood . 
she had her daughter with her , 
and the daughter was , oh , about a second grader . 
and she was actively looking for people who would babysit her child . 
oh , my . 
and i was almost more reluctant of letting my older children go babysit for her because i didn't know her 
so , i mean people are so different . 
oh , i know . 
um , well , obviously you've never had to look for a day care or anything . 
 and i worked just a parttime job 
and , uh , i went in 
and , you know , i made  a few  phone calls , 
i went in and visited . 
i asked questions such as how they would discipline a child . 
um , that was a concern with me . 
um , you know , you learn a lot by going in there 
and they explain to you , you know , what their day consists of and what their general rules are , 
and , um , you know , that's as much as i know . 
you probably could get really good feedback from a lot of other working mothers 
 but i , 
go ahead . 
how did you stumble upon the daycare center ? 
did you just look it up in a phone book 
or what was it ? 
um , i think i went by location for one thing . 
i think most people do that . 
or do i know anyone who has their child in a day care 
i would say most people would probably go by word of mouth . 
and then , you know , i mean , even at that you have to consider the logistics of it . 
you know , i mean , you're not going to take your child south of town if you work north .
so there are just so many considerations . 
then again , did , um , money come into play with it at all ? 
you know , i've never had the luxury of not having that be a factor . um , even in something as important as day care . 
i know if i didn't have that stipulation , i would have done things differently 
um , montessori school would be something that i would have pursued , 
but that's always a little bit more expensive than what i could look at . 
um , and i was very very fortunate in that i didn't have to do that on a fulltime basis . 
you know , when you get into the fulltime basis day care , 
good morning . 
my name is jean . 
i'm tina . 
oh , where you from tina ? 
i live in garland , texas . 
i'm in pennsylvania . 
oh , my lands , you're the farthest person i've ever talked to . 
do you work for texas instruments ? 
now , i don't have anybody that works for t i , 
but , uh 
i don't know what .
i see , 
well that's neat . 
uh , foods like you would   for a dinner party or something like that . 
i guess so , 
it may be interesting , because probably here in texas , we may eat a little differently than you do up there .
my brother lives down  east  of us down there , 
and i don't think they ate all that much different .
oh , really . 
 uh , i think as long as you plan your basic foods , 
course , for a dinner party , you fancy things up a little bit more . 
that's true . 
well , uh , the thing that i found interesting , 
my husband and i lived up in washington state for awhile 
 and up there , of course they ate a lot of sea food ,
oh , uhhuh . 
and down here , sea food is pretty expensive , because ,
and it's not as good as if it's fresh . 
but here , we eat a lot of like mexican foods , 
and , um , up there there was no place that we went tasted like real mexican food to me . 
is that right ? 
but it just ,
well , they probably were trying to do the best they could . 
yeah . 
 and , uh , down here , we eat a lot more fried foods , i think . 
like chicken fried steak ,
up there , uh , it was hardly ever heard of 
and up there hardly anyone drank ice tea .
well they do in the summertime , 
 i think that  
of course , you have warmer weather most of the time . 
so , uh , 
it never gets real cold . 
so , i , 
but when we have a dinner party around here , i think a lot of the time a mexican menu is something real popular . 
is that right ? 
and a lot of the times when we get together , well everybody will bring a mexican dish 
more like covered dishes for those type of dinners . 
how about you , 
what is real popular up there ? 
well , i don't know , 
oh , really . 
uh , i think   like parties and that though are , 
well , like we had a dinner party here not too long ago with a mystery dinner party .
 but , basically , we you know , included all the basic , uh , foods that you are supposed to have in a meal   .
your , uh , bread family and your , 
or least what it used to be the regular menu  was followed and   ,
uh , something from each area that you're supposed to choose from . 
and , uh , we ourselves are into the wok cooking , 
you know they been advertising that 
well , that's good . 
they have a lot of vegetable to them , 
and , uh , 
oh , yes . 
i love that kind of cooking . 
uh , unfortunately , i am married to a man and have two children that eat about four things .
 is he a meat and potato person ? 
well , all our family is gone . 
they are out on their own . 
and , uh . 
that probably makes it easier , 
and , uh . 
we find ourselves eating a lot of macaroni and cheese 
well , my husband didn't like that , 
so us kids , 
we had five children 
and we ate that when he wasn't going to be home for supper , 
 that's what we had  .
well , that's pretty much what we do , 
if dad's not coming home , we have macaroni and cheese ,
but , they like , uh , spaghetti . 
you know , that's one meal ,
uh , yeah . 
and the whole family eats . 
but , uh , there are several things that , 
well as a matter of fact , i keep chicken nuggets handy all the time , because . 
oh , those always go good . 
the children love them , 
and , uh , they are real easy to cook 
and my girls don't like beef , 
oh really . 
well maybe .
i guess , 
well , yeah , 
it could be , they don't , 
i think it's the texture of it , 
but it takes more chewing .
children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers ,
and it is easier to chew . 
so they're not too much into beef . 
my husband and i eat more beef than we should , 
but at least we keep our chicken nuggets handy for them .
we don't really uh , you know , entertain too much . 
i don't know if you do or not , 
but we don't a whole lot , 
we're more , once in a while , but mostly family ,
we have a real tiny little house , 
we don't have room really ,
but , we do get together for fellowships at our church , 
and , my husband and i do a lot of the planning in that . 
well that's good . 
it is 
and it's fun to , uh , 
i like just having a pot luck meal where everyone brings their favorite dish . 
we do a lot of that  take   ,
and our homemakers meet at the church also , 
and , uh , 
so , you don't really include any certain food groups , 
you just bring ,
that's right .
sometimes you have all desserts , 
that's true , 
that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever ,
but , it doesn't happen very often , 
usually you get a pretty wide variety 
 and you can   ,
i remember one time we had a progressive dinner . 
oh , those are fun . 
it's the only time that ever . 
they are . 
but it's the only time i can remember that , 
i can't remember what food it was 
it might have been the main dish that hardly anyone showed up with . 
several people were supposed to bring ,
uh , uhhuh . 
and we had tons of desserts and tons of appetizers 
 oh , uhhuh 
was there enough to go around ? .
you know we all took real tiny little portions ,
we were not sure who didn't show up with the food .
that's kind of irresponsible and does upset you , because they are grown adults usually  , 
and you know they know better . 
even if they can't do it , they can always maybe get somebody else to  cook  .
either go ahead and fix your dish 
or call someone that can . 
i know it . 
well , that sounds neat , 
i can't , uh , believe you're so far away , 
but you sound so close . 
it sounds like you're here in dallas . 
but , i'm up at my daughter's , 
i don't even have any of my recipes with me . 
 uh , you know   , 
i don't know if i have anything handy , 
we were getting ready to go swimming , 
and we're waiting on my sister . 
oh , great . 
cara , hold on just a second 
as a matter of fact , my ,
they are ready to go . 
well , have we talked long enough 
i think it probably has been . 
so i'll let , 
so , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
oh , same here . 
you have a good day . 
thank you . 
thanks for calling . 
how many , 
you said yours are all , 
i mean , that sounds like an army . 
oh , lord . 
that is an army , 
i came from a family of six , 
and i have only got two , 
and they are , one  . . . 
well   any number is nice , let me tell you . 
well , i kind of decided that that's not parenting , 
that's a hobby . 
it's not as fair to the children either , i do not think . 
well , do not tell that to all my friends . 
they are into quality time . 
i am into getting through the day . 
but sometimes you can hurt them by having too much quality time too . 
well you know , whose parents spend every ,
and when i take care of some people's kids ,
when they have teachers' holidays ,
and you can spot them ,
you can tell . 
how to just entertain themselves . 
yeah , 
it's a problem for any child 
and you take one that's used to being , uh , busy having something to do all the time , it makes a big difference . 
it's not a problem for my two , 
they are only eighteen months apart .
uh , keeps you busy . 
 well , that's great . 
did all five of yours complete college ? 
uh , but she's married now , 
they built a home just a couple miles from us . 
well , how did you go about selecting a college , then ? .
with our first boy , we persuaded him to start here , 
and i do not always think you should try to make them stay closer to home . 
uh , right now , i think the main thing is to look at what they are interested in . uh , and take what they are interested in , 
and then , then start looking for schools . 
do you think that what they say that they are interested in is , at eighteen is going to be what they are ultimately 
but , mike , our oldest boy , i think he would have . 
he wanted to go to  embrey riddle  
and we talked him into going local here first . 
and he only went a few months and then transferred to pittsburgh . 
he went to aeronautical , uh , oh , just learning to work on engines and that . 
uh , it has to do with airplanes and everything , which is what his whole life is .
and i really wish we would have let him go where he wanted to go originally . 
and he would probably be flying , is what he would be doing . 
uh , he's working for pratt and whitney in connecticut 
and they build and rebuild non jet engines . 
how about the other three who went ? 
uh , we let her go where she wanted to , uh , 
we did not want her to go , 
but she went to erie , to gannan university . uh , or gannan college , 
i am not sure which it is , 
college , i guess . 
uh , she went there two years 
and it was more expensive 
and she soon realized , you know , 
even though she did not like clarion , she came back and finished at clarion . because , it , uh , saved her quite a bit of money 
and she got really the same basic education that she wanted . 
and our other two boys , they went to clarion also . and , uh , did very well there . 
and uh , they have all really got really good jobs . 
and , uh , 
when they were , like in junior high and high school ,
uh , yeah , 
they just expected to go . 
daphne never went , 
she always said she would never go to college . 
i always thought she would change her mind ,
but she did not . 
and there's nothing wrong with that , you know , if , 
college is not for everybody . 
but , uh , wage income . 
i think it's what they want out of life , 
because if they get an education and are willing to go where the jobs are , they can make you know , a much better income . 
like my kids , they are all making more than my husband was making when he retired from the state . 
you know , that boggles , 
did you go to college ? 
you did . 
see it makes a difference . 
and there really was not a choice , 
i mean the finances , uh , dictated that you had to go there . 
uh . uhhuh . 
i kind of , 
i am not going to say i resent it , 
but i was , well you know , 
my parents did not even discuss with me going to college out of state ,
some place else . 
and i just knew that the finances , you know , would not support it . 
if i had known i am not going to say easy , but how much less difficult than i thought it would be to get a , uh , scholarship ,
now when i finished there , then i got a scholarship to go the harvard university in boston . 
and uh , i think that was probably one of the best things that had ever happened , 
i mean i was ,
that's great . 
different life styles , 
and i think it was probably one of the best things that ever happened to me . 
now my kids , i keep saying that , uh , you know , i would like them to go to the best school that they possibly could . 
and i do not know , you know , what the realities , you know , is going to look like , you know , 
we are putting money away already . 
uh , but i really think it's important you know , them getting an education , they really need you know , a socialization away from what they are raised in .
it's quite a bit different . 
see that's the way we are , 
we are more of a rural type of an area 
and it does make a difference . 
they say , you should not look at the expense of the college when you are looking . 
you should not . 
not really . 
because , they say that a lot of times you get more help ,
oh , yeah . 
and so , in the long run , if it's really what they want , you know , they are better off . 
now our children all pretty much borrowed for their school . 
uh , we did all we could , 
but they pretty much had to borrow a lot of their money to go . 
did you have anything in mind that , uh , you'd like to share ? 
well , i , uh , just had a christmas around the world party 
and i fixed , uh , a crab meat spread that is real good and real easy . 
ooh , that sounds good . 
uh , it's like , uh , eight ounces of cream cheese 
and you mix it with one tablespoon onion juice and one tablespoon lemon juice , one tablespoon worcester sauce and mix it and spread it out onto a plate . 
one tablespoon of worcester ? 
and then you take and , uh , cover that with drained crab meat mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on triscuits crackers . 
oh , that , 
and that always goes over real well 
and it's real easy . 
how much chili sauce did you say ? 
it's one of the small bottles . 
like eight , 
i don't think , uh , 
not eight ounces . 
that would be a lot . 
is it ? 
well , it doesn't make quite as much as you think , 
but , yeah , 
spread it out because you keep the cream cheese kind of thin . 
and how much crab meat did you use ? 
one tin .
and drain it real good . 
oh , okay . 
have you ever used the , uh , imitation , yet ? 
i used it , uh , last christmastime . 
uh , what did i put it in ? 
i think i just served it by itself . 
there's like a little tidbit with the sauce to dip it into and stuff . 
ooh , that sounds , 
i've tried it 
and then i have it here on hand for about a week 
and then all of a sudden it dawned on me , 
wait , is this totally imitation 
and then i found out , 
i went back to the store 
and they said it is a fish product . 
so , therefore , you really don't have a very long life , you know 
i thought , so , you know , they should put some directions on some of these new things they're making that you really don't know what the shelf life is . 
that's very true . 
you know . 
very true . 
i had bought a cheesecake , uh , 
and they very nicely put onto the box that it may be re frozen , which i felt was real nice . 
oh , that's a good idea . 
whose was that ? 
it , uh , was , uh , lawry's , i believe , or lawler's . 
and i got it , 
do you have a sam's wholesale warehouse up there ? 
it's real , 
uh , sam's , 
that's where i picked it up . 
it comes out of chicago 
and they're very good 
oh , that sounds good 
 because that's great . 
that must be the ones that look like they're packaged for a restaurant . 
and they have the little papers between them . 
oh , hey , that sounds , 
and i think they're , what , about nine dollars and something . 
and it's something good to have on hand , too . 
so , you can , uh , 
and then you can re freeze . 
hey , that sounds great . 
that s , 
very good . 
and that's the one thing that i hate to make is desserts . 
oh , do you ? 
and that's my favorite . 
is it ? 
and i really don't care for desserts that well other than one piece of it . 
oh , i love to eat it , 
but i don't like to make it . 
it takes time 
and you have to rack your brain , 
and , time i don't have anymore .
that's the thing i hate most about entertaining is thinking of what i'm going to serve . 
it is . 
i said i can make it no time . 
it's trying to think , 
and then we just , uh , built a new home 
and i have one of these kitchens that's the center of the house 
 and so no matter where they're at , your company can see you cooking .
that's right . 
and your mess .
 well , this is what everyone has said . 
i decided it looks better in better homes and gardens than it does in practicality . 
but , uh , what i have learned in the , uh , ten months we've lived here , is everything through , ready 
that's right . 
so you have to have the picturesque kitchen , you know , right out of the magazine . 
well , i like to have mine all done anyway , because then i want to party , too . 
i don't want to sit in the kitchen and be putting an olive on something .
you're right . 
you know . 
and you know the funny thing is , now that i have a large kitchen with a big island and that , i still have people trying to come , you know , 
they'll come in the kitchen 
we have the chairs on the other side 
you're not allowed to trespass into my kitchen .
and it has worked out . 
but at our point of life we know many of the people we're entertaining 
well , a lot of our entertaining anymore with the couples , again , that we've known a long time like you , uh , we all bring things 
and it sure makes it a whole lot easier .
well , we even 
now we decided that we all meet , we have it worked , 
all right , 
well , i'm not a big exerciser , 
but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight . 
and so basically at this point i'm a real walker . 
i am , too . 
are you ? 
i don't do oh , i guess i'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips , you know , and 
i don't do that . 
i mostly just take a walk around the block or with my baby 
you know , and i have to do that at least once a day . if it , 
oh , that's good . 
i can't neglect that because of the baby either . 
and how old is your baby ? 
uh , well , she was premature , 
so she's about nine months now , though . 
goll , times goes fast . 
well , i walk two and a half to three miles every night . 
oh , that's great . 
my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago 
 and he lost sixtytwo pounds 
 and i lost twentyone . 
oh , my goodness . 
 so we've decided to maintain our weight , that we will do this exercise walking program 
and we walk our dog every night 
we have a little path that we do .
we try to get out , uh , every night . 
and he plays racquetball twice a week , 
but i'm not into that , 
well , i think that is just wonderful . 
now , as far as i'm concerned , i have several other children 
and so , uh , i think at this point to fit it to other things , it's kind of a task . 
let's go .
right  , 
that's right . 
i know my kids are into sports 
and tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty 
so we will just go out after that . 
so , my kids , luckily , are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk . 
now , does your husband usually go with you , then ? 
oh , see , now that's really nice . 
because mine's at meetings sometimes 
and he's not really into it 
my husband never was either until he lost the weight . 
that was his decision . 
he had arthritis in his hips 
and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise . 
i think that is so wonderful . 
so once he got motivated , now he's ready to walk every night . 
and our dog has lost a little weight . 
he walks every night , too .
so , he gets excited when he sees us put on our walking shoes . 
i bet . 
i think that's really , really good . 
after you've done it a certain amount of time , it kind of does get to be a routine . 
it's not , 
like when i first started , it , you know , that was the hardest thing was 
making time for it . 
but now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something , i really notice that i haven't done it in a  . . . 
you know . and i like the time because my kids , sometimes they come with me 
and sometimes they don't . 
and when they don't , i really notice , you know , how fun it can be when they come . 
so , uh , i like to have somebody come with me . 
i know , 
i do , too . 
uh , i know enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home 
so it's not real dangerous , 
but still , i don't like to go alone . 
i never do either . even if i have my dog with me . 
you know , it's nice to have another person there , 
but  . . . 
you know , 
mostly , it's my husband 
and sometimes it's my kids . 
well , i think that's great . 
i really think i do . 
i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing . 
uh , i found real quick that wasn't for me . 
me , too . 
i did the dance step when i lived up in 
and it just wore me out . 
i would leave totally exhausted . 
i never lost any weight , 
and i got to the point i dreaded going in . 
so walking seems to be a good solution for me 
and it doesn't cost anything .
right  , 
and it gives me time to think . 
so i think , not only does it help my body , 
but i think it helps my mind 
so i like that . 
that's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk 
need something 
they can wait until you get back home . 
well , i think that's great .
well , that's what i do for  , 
that's all i do , too . 
okay . 
how's the weather been in plano ? .
basically about the same as what you've probably had . 
this is probably unusual topic to give two of us in the same city . 
well , i don't know about you , 
but i was really enjoying the cool snap last couple of weeks , 
and i'm ready for it to come back . 
and today i know when i got up that the temperature said more like , close , seventynine or eighty 
 so i'm kind of ready for the pumpkin weather . 
oh , are you ? 
i don't care for that as much . 
you don't 
are you a summer person ? 
are you ? 
well , i have a friend who's the same way , 
and anything below sixty , she's just not happy 
 but i think what i would miss is the change of seasons and all because i know in plano we really don't have as many seasons as , uh , 
my husband's from nebraska , 
and they have more of the four seasons . 
and i'm from utah , 
so , i like ,
oh , you're 
i just don't like the cold . 
you don't like the cold . 
well , i usually like it about sweater weather , 
and the problem 
it goes from hot , 
and then you get a couple of weeks of that indian summer , 
and then it's cold 
 and i wish it were several months of that . 
i don't like the rain either . 
well , i don't either unless it's like , uh , 
some of my favorite's like a friday night when it rains 
and you really didn't have anywhere to go , 
and it's sleeping time . 
but if you have to get up and get out in it , i don't like it either .
 well , we have several children that are in sports , 
and so 
oh , yeah . 
well , sure it does . 
that kind of schedule , you really need a lot more sunshine . 
i like it better , i think . 
and also the evenings are going to be getting , uh , darker sooner 
but i did a walk last night , 
and it seemed like it was a little bit hot still . 
sometimes when you work up a sweat you need it to be a little bit cooler . 
the thing about when it gets hot here is , i don't like the humidity , 
that part i don't care about . 
well , i agree , absolutely , 
and you know , it's all relative , 
because i was from west texas , 
and it was very dry , 
and so i thought dallas was awful , 
and i still think so , 
but then this summer we went to orlando for a week , 
and it was so humid there that were wet every morning . 
they had to get the 
oh , really . 
and when we got back to dallas it seemed really dry  ,
but i agree with you , 
the humidity , especially for curly heads like me . 
oh , is that right ? 
 well another reason , 
well , i guess i can't say that i don't like the rain completely . 
we have a little garden that we have 
and , you know , i don't know if that's because plants are just that way 
and they like rain , 
or , it seems they thrive when it rains , 
they just , really , 
i think so too . 
i know our grass needs mowing twice as often 
 but it seems like here , 
i would like it to rain and then be over , and then not rain for a while . 
it seems like when it gets stuck in a rain pattern , that's all it does . 
i am ready for a little bit of the cooler weather and not so much in the nineties 
i guess my best would be probably sixtyeight when you wake up or sixtysix , and then probably seventyfive during the day . 
well i like seventies 
do you like the heat in the summer then when it gets up in the nineties and hundreds . 
you can give me seventies 
 and you can give me eighties 
keep it there .
 and i'm okay . 
but when it gets too hot , then i don't like that 
i stay in the house because it's just , 
well , i do , too , 
 and that was one thing about the year around school that originally we had been sort of negative on it . 
but then we started thinking , especially in plano , the weather is so hot in august , that there really isn't a lot the children can do outside anyhow . 
that's okay .
um , i've thought about that , too , 
and , um , when we take our vacations , we do take them in august sometimes 
we do too . 
i think a lot of people agree the same . 
it just really gets way , 
when it gets way too hot 
 and we've been here for several years , 
and we've been here years when it's been hundreds 
now there have been worse summers . 
in fact this morning when they were talking about , uh , harold taft , they were talking about how this has been one of the milder 
everybody seems to be , 
you can tell some of the newscasters when they like the heat , because they'll talk about it being so gorgeous on those days when we're melting , 
and you can tell when they talk about beautiful weather some mornings when it'll be too cold , 
and they'll say , 
well those are the ones that like the cold weather . 
he always did such a good job , i thought . 
oh , yeah , 
he did , 
it was 
a good weather man , 
he didn't go with all the gimmicks that some of them did . 
anyway , um , i guess it's , 
that's okay , 
oh , is that right ? 
you don't have to wait for them to say 
oh , good . 
well good , 
well , then have a good day . 
you too . 
and i hope you enjoy the weather this week . 
you too . 
uh , my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother 
 and they're just really close here . 
and his mother has bad health too 
and so i go over sometimes in the day when he's at work 
and i , um , help with her and bathe her and feed her . 
that's hard to be a caretaker i really believe . 
it's really difficult to be a caretaker twentyfour hours a day . 
oh , it's very difficult 
i know . 
uh , she has alzheimer's and does not remember , uh , a lot 
and so she asks the same questions over and over again . which is not you know , unrealistic . 
um , and so you just have to try and be patient and answer them again or just answer another question . 
uh , i , uh , 
and just bring the kids  in  the family 
and just come over and visit grandma because she gets very disoriented . 
how old is she ? 
she's ninetytwo . 
uh , see my father is ninetytwo 
and uh , he and mother still live at the house and drive and 
oh , i think that's wonderful . 
but you know uh , whenever something happens to one of them then ,
too many horror stories about nursing homes 
and so , 
i was just going to say . 
they're in missouri 
and they just , well , they can't take the proper care of them .
and , uh , really don't have a place to go . 
uh , i think it's wonderful these places that aren't nursing homes necessarily 
but they can go and reside there like little apartments ,
and i like that idea if they can handle it themselves . 
there's one very close to where my parents are 
but , uh , i think it would be nice 
but my dad's the type he wouldn't want to spend the money on anything . 
so , uh , i mean , he's from that old depression era 
and , uh , you know , oh , it's just  blissfull  that they're both ,
i would imagine that in with me . 
so , uh , 
but i know a lot of people have said that and then find out how tough it is 
but i think you'd have to really , 
nursing homes . 
but i just don't know how much you can see when you go for a , 
i think you just have to drop in all unexpectedly a lot . 
and so many people when they put people in the nurses home , they never see them . 
they don't go and see them . 
that's right . 
they never go to see them . 
that's right . 
i've talked to many , uh , owners of places and say that nobody even , 
maybe christmas . 
you know , um , um , some are good 
i have to say that . 
but for the most part i truly believe that the parents would be better if they were with the children . 
oh , i do too . 
or if they could be real , real nearby where they could see them everyday or so . 
uh , because i know governor richards is really upset about what she's finding in the nursing homes , uh , regulation in texas 
so maybe we'll get it improved . 
i hope so . 
you know , i think it's very difficult in the first place to make that choice 
oh , it's tough i'm sure . 
and then if you find out that they are not having good care , you know , i'm sure that it is just , 
that would be devastating i'm sure 
uh , and yet if you didn't feel like you could be a good caretaker i don't , uh , 
it's a very , very hard decision i think . 
it is a tough decision 
and it's one that needs a great deal of thought ,
i think that's right , 
and especially if you're not a person that is like a medical person maybe or something that the person needs medical treatment . 
now i know a friend of mine who had a father , uh , she brought to her home , uh , to live there , 
but he needed the medical treatment 
and she had a nursing person come in like three times a week to help him out . 
and that might be a partial solution ,
but , um , i personally am for the trying it at home caretaker part before i think i'd ever , 
i would hope we could do that ,
well , anyway , 
well , i think we kind of are along the same lines . 
we've covered a little bit 
and , uh , it's good to hear from you 
have a good , 
have a lovely day . 
have a good lif , 
have you faced , uh , elderly care yet , uh , nursing home care for any of your parents ? 
unfortunately , yes . 
and we were talking , uh , 
we had a review with the nursing home staff . 
my mother's in a nursing home . 
and , uh , we had a review today 
and a few things we had to do that  , making decisions on living wills and 
so , yes , 
and it's not something that is , uh , you know , 
i never thought i'd have to go through this kind of experience . 
but i guess we all do . 
i think sooner or later , uh , 
both my mother and my husband's mother , we had to end up putting in nursing homes 
and they were to the point that they only lived , both of them , about six weeks once they got in . 
oh , really ? 
and , uhhuh . 
you know , it's absolutely devastating . 
what have you found in dealing with the nursing homes ? 
well , all the horror stories you hear about them i think are true . 
uh , you know , we've looked around 
and , my wife has looked extensively at all the ones in the area .
and the one she is in now , uh , there's a lot of drawbacks , a lot of things we don't like . 
but , again , it's no different than every one . 
and , you know , the cost of it , the , three thousand dollars a month 
um , uhhuh . 
when you think about it , for what you're paying a hospital for 
it's not that expensive , really . 
uh , in the two between my mother and my motherinlaw . 
and , uh , theirs both ran , 
oh , i think my motherinlaw's was like fifteen hundred 
and my mother's was two thousand . 
this has been five years ago . 
and , uh 
when i started out with my motherinlaw , because she was in there first , i 
and they knew . 
and if i'd pop in unexpectedly , i discovered , you know , they did better . 
oh , really ? 
you know , uhhuh . 
so i got to where , i knew then when my mother was in you know , not to go the same time all the time .
and when i was looking for the nursing homes , another thing that i learned , uh , 
we had my mother all set to go into one 
and for some reason i just went back , and on my own went around the different floors . 
and , i saw areas that they had not shown me 
and they did not come across as well 
well , i'll be darned . 
so , uh , we did not put her in that one . 
we put her in another one that i went a couple of times 
you know , this is the whole point . 
you've got , you've got to shop them . 
you do . 
i know my mother's in a unit that's mainly alzheimer's 
 and , uh , we're convinced that she probably would be better off in a geriatric . 
uh , the fact that these people  , they're up and around , 
but it's reminds me too much of an asylum type s , 
and it's very , very , 
does your mother have alzheimer's ? 
well , who knows . 
they call it , uh , dementia . 
and , uh , we don't know . 
i mean she does not know us anymore 
 and whether it's alzheimer's or what it is 
but it's , basically the same . 
and her health is not that bad . 
although she has gone this last , 
well , she had been in a retirement community 
and somewhere in the back of her mind she had it that she would live with her children . 
she has gone down steadily since she has been in , 
and she's been in the nursing home now for , oh , i would say about three months . 
did she know that she was going to a nursing home ? 
i'm sorry ? 
what kind of car are you going to buy next ? 
well , one of the cars i'm thinking about buying next is , uh , a nice , safe , small car , 
but , um , uh , the reason being , is we just purchased a van a little while ago because we have 
and we use that to get back and forth and haul kids around and 
and we have another four door car that i drive to work , 
and i think it'd be more economical if i were able to   a smaller car 
that's true , 
what are you looking at ? 
oh , yeah .
but i think i'll be driving mine about two or three more years anyway . 
oh , yes , 
but , uh . 
well , the cost of new cars recently are extremely outrageous for the 
they are . 
i sure do like the looks of that new mitsubishi diamante . 
oh , yes , 
that is a pretty car . 
 uh , i really like the looks also of the new mazda 
that's pretty , too . 
but um , the costs of a new car and those new models are extremely out of our price range right now . 
they get pretty expensive . 
they do . 
the last one i bought , i bought a , uh , 
well , it's a town car , 
but it was a demo , returned 
 and i got it with like , you know , i think it was like fourteen thousand miles on it 
 well , you can't go wrong with that kind of opportunity . 
so i was really pleased to find that , 
then , i bought it for cheaper , 
i was looking at a honda accord , a brand new one 
 and i bought the lincoln town car for just a little less money than what i was going to buy the new honda accord . 
well , you get a much bigger , better 
and the thing about it is 
well , that's fantastic . 
that's real , real good . 
so , uh , i have really been impressed . 
do you , 
but i have loved this car better than anything i've ever driven , because you can go on the road and get there 
and you're not even tired . 
and it gets like twentysix miles to the gallon on the road . 
oh , it does ? 
that's unbelievable for that size of car . 
they kept telling me that , 
so well , actually before i signed the papers on it , i took it over to boozier city 
 and it did it . 
that's great . 
but it's , uh , 
that kind of gas mileage , uh , we're kind of hoping for on our van . 
well , that's kind of what we've always been told , you know , they'll do , 
and then we hope for it , 
and it never happens 
 but it does get good gas mileage . 
well , that's excellent . 
most of the time when i don't go anywhere i can drive it for like three weeks to and from work , you know , and then fill it up , 
does it , uh , need a lot of repairs ? 
is it a very reliable kind of car ? 
i haven't had anything , 
i've taken it in twice for like just really minor things , 
and it cost me the twentyfive dollars . 
 uh , really something really silly when we first got it , 
we couldn't get the light , 
they have all these lights in the car 
 and it has this fancy little light that gives you a reading light for the passengers in the back seat 
 and we couldn't get the light to turn off . 
and we kept trying , you know , 
and we went out to dinner with some friends , 
and it stayed on all night , you know 
oh dear . 
oh dear .
 and we couldn't get it to turn off , 
and the next day my husband goes out there 
and he tries to get it off , 
we turn the knob , you know , in the front that's supposed to turn the 
and he took it in , 
and i can't get the light off , 
it's broken . 
so they took it in and charged us the twentyfive dollars , 
and they called and told us though , that all you have to do is turn the off switch , 
and they showed us where the switch was . 
they charged you twentyfive dollars just to tell you that , huh . 
they thought there was really something wrong with it when he told them he had already done the switch . 
oh , so they probably went through the , 
but he hadn't done the right one . 
i see .
and it's right on the arm rest in the back 
 and we didn't know it was there . 
oh , okay . 
and the guy hit it with his arm when he got in the car 
and found it right away . 
 and so we thought , you know , it was broken . 
but we've had just , uh , 
i guess it's been in two times . 
i've had it three years now . 
and , uh , it's been in two , maybe three times . 
but it's just been real minor things . 
well , i think that , uh , you have an excellent deal then , 
and the company is able probably to offer that kind of warranty on the car because they know it's so well built that they don't expect any kind of major repairs 
that's right . 
 and those companies wouldn't be able to afford that for that kind of extended warranty or warranty at all , 
that's right . 
but it's been an enjoyable car . 
like i say , i'll probably never be able to have another one , because i think we bought it for about sixteen thousand , you know 
 and i said , i'll never find another one for that price . 
not at all . 
and they keep going up , 
so i'll have to enjoy it , 
and , uh , i am not real well informed on exactly what richardson does . 
i know that uh , they ask us to bundle our newspapers , 
and we do that , 
and we recycle our aluminum pop cans and stuff . 
i see . 
uh , it started out several years ago when they put these , uh , collection sites 
and they just couldn't believe how many people were going out of their way to fill these things up . 
these huge dumpsters were being filled up in a matter of a week . 
so they knew that there was something going on here . 
so , they started looking into programs , 
and what we have now , 
they changed the whole way that they do garbage in plano . 
instead of collecting plastic bags of garbage two days a week , they make a collection on monday for yard waste , 
and the yard waste has to be put in a special bag that's a decomposable paper sack 
it's a pretty good size . 
it's maybe the size of two or three , um , grocery bags . 
and we put that out by the street , 
and they collect those on monday . 
and then on wednesday , we put out two containers that they gave us . 
one container's a huge , green , monstrous thing that uh , uh , a special truck comes by and hooks onto the side of it and flips the container into the back of the garbage truck . 
and that's where you put your regular , um , garbage and trash . 
and then also , that same day , you put out a small tub , 
it's maybe two feet high and three feet by two feet wide , 
and you just throw in your aluminum and your milk jugs and newspaper , 
and then the . 
and then they separate it . 
they have a big truck that has like maybe five big doors on the side of it , 
and they throw the different stuff in the different doors . 
oh , that's a neat system . 
it is . 
and apparently it went off pretty much without a hitch . 
the special five door trucks were a little tough in getting because of something to do with the persian gulf war 
oh , uhhuh . 
the engines or something were being shipped over there for something or other . 
but it does work pretty well . 
well , i know our son and daughterinlaw live in plano , 
and i know they have commented on the system . 
i don't know that they know that it worked that way , 
but they have the two separate containers and stuff . 
oh , yes , 
i noticed something interesting last time , i guess two wednesdays ago when they were picking up , 
i happened to be out there in the morning when they were picking up that tub stuff , 
and the man who was doing the separating , when he was done emptying the tub , he took a little electronic reader device off of his belt 
and he read the bar code that was on the side of the tub . 
so they must be collecting information about who does it , and how often . 
oh , that is interesting . 
because i wonder if that means that if you don't do it 
do you suppose they will come and knock on your door and , 
i don't know , 
but i think that's a really interesting question . 
that is interesting . 
you know , will you be penalized if you don't . 
will you , uh . 
there's no law that says you have to buy a newspaper 
so it's possible that there is a person in plano that doesn't buy any of those three things , and therefore wouldn't have . 
that's true , except that it's hard to imagine , you know , when you have , uh , cans , you know , from the market and , uh 
they won't take vegetable cans . 
oh , they don't take vegetable cans . 
just the aluminum pop cans . 
this is just their aluminum cans . 
well , then yes , 
so they have , 
that's interesting . 
i wonder , uh , uh , 
what they're doing with that . 
wouldn't you really like to know ? 
someday i'm sure we'll find out . 
i'm sure  , 
what are you doing reading  , you know . 
so tell me your feelings on recycling . 
i think it's a very good thing . 
uh , i think it helps if the city is giving you a nudge to do it 
and i can't say that my husband and i are real conscientious . 
we got started on the aluminum cans because our , uh , grandson was collecting them , uh , to raise money 
so we started collecting them , 
and now he's through , 
so we've kept on 
 and it's interesting , too , that uh , just inside your city limits , to , you know 
dump them off . 
and that is interesting . 
i'm sure there's bound to be some here in richardson 
 but we just haven't really seen them advertised or 
well , the pl , 
the plano newspaper a little list of all the recycling centers for all the different things . 
they publish it every single day . 
well , that's interesting . 
and phone numbers , and that kind of stuff . 
well , uh , i haven't noticed richardson , you know , making that big a , 
on a scale of one to ten where do you stand and why ? 
well , i guess i stand uh , on , probably ten for no , uh , restrictions . 
i , uh , recently just moved to texas from , uh , south dakota and nebraska , 
and i guess in terms of gun control i've always , uh , been raised with the , uh , idea in the constitution that , uh , citizens had a right to bear arms , 
and i realize that probably way back when when the constitution was written it probably regarded , uh , more , uh , of a national defense , uh , than anything else , 
but , uh , on the other hand , too , uh , people then , uh , needed to use firearms for , um , survival in terms of , uh , food 
 and , uh , i was raised , uh , you know , hunting all the time , 
i lived on the farm , and , uh , you know , enjoy hunting 
and i guess i have , uh , some problems with , uh , being restricted to , um , owning a gun for , you know , hunting purposes mainly . 
and , um , it scares me a little bit to think that they would begin restricting gun control to the point where , um , eventually we may not be able to have that right any more . 
i can understand that . 
i was raised in oklahoma , 
and of course , being oklahoman and texan , uh , 
the hunting and everything , 
and i used to   things in my father and my husband having guns and all , 
and used to be all in favor of it , 
but all of a sudden it's starting to get really scary with these gangs . 
yet i think i would vote a one if i thought that it would be nation wide and they can guarantee no one would have a gun , no crooks , nothing . 
but because i know that's not going to happen , then i have to probably right up there about an eight .
uh , moving to this area , of course it happens everywhere , 
but , uh , i guess we're pretty naive coming from small towns , uh , in the midwest and then , uh , moving to a larger city where there are driveby shootings 
and , uh , there seems like killing for no reason at all , 
and , uh . 
well , it just seems like in the past three or four years it has just gotten so much worse than it was . 
there's always been a certain amount of crime in you know , your urban areas , 
and i know we lived in chicago for seven years , 
and of course it was definitely there . 
so when we first moved here , it wasn't as bad as this . 
you know , it's just getting all of a sudden so much worse . 
i don't know whether it's due to the drugs and the , uh , drug kings that are here and jamaican drug kings coming in . 
i don't know whether that's it , or street gangs . 
i don't know what the answer is . 
i know that it's scary , 
and yet i hate the government constantly telling me what i can do and what i can't do , 
and that's basically what the gun control would end up being . 
i think so , 
they'll get one , 
uh , and then , uh . 
well , it's very true . 
it's not the law abiding citizen that , you know , is dangerous with the gun .
it's the ones that are going out and stealing it . 
and i said i think the only way i would be in big favor of gun control is if they could absolutely guarantee that nobody would have them . 
and i think that would almost have to go with armies , too . 
i mean , they'd have to be almost worldwide , which we know would never ever happen . 
that's for sure . 
you know , armed forces could have them , 
some idiot would come out and sell it to somebody on the street to make a quick buck . 
uh , when , uh , they had the revolutionary war and people decided that they , uh , were fed up with the government , uh , 
and if they didn't have a way uh , to fight back they would have been in big trouble . 
that's very true 
who knows , 
we maybe want to overthrow the government .
 well , the way things are going . 
i know , 
if somebody doesn't do something . 
uh , you know , actually purchase the gun ? 
well , you know , they introduced some gun control back when i was a teenager , i believe , in terms of , uh , every gun you bought had to be licensed , i believe . 
and , uh , you know , that didn't bother me , uh , too much , 
and so , i guess it depends , um , if there are some statistics that show uh , that people , uh , commit crimes on the spur of the moment . 
 and , uh , what is coincidence , 
we got a babysitter 
and we went to the movies that past weekend . 
oh , so did i .
 and we saw cape fear . 
oh , i heard that was excellent . 
it is . 
is it ? 
uh , i wanted to see that .
i was deciding between that and , uh , my girl 
and , uh , my boyfriend and i went to see my girl . 
oh , how was that ? 
oh , it was excellent . 
it was a really , really good movie . 
i'd recommend it . 
i heard that's , a movie that , uh , you really can't take children . 
is that true ? .
 uh , there were quite a few , uh , kids in there with their parents . 
uh , i don't know , though , 
i've heard that , and then what you just told me 
because , uh , the little boy dies . 
yeah . 
it was sad . 
it was really sad . 
but , uh , it kind of shows how his , uh , best friend , this little girl , deals with his death 
but , it was really good . 
it was sad , very sad . 
 oh , i want to see that one . 
well , cape fear was more suspenseful . 
it was really suspenseful . 
so that's a real good movie to see . 
i heard it was , uh , sort of like , uh , not , uh , too violent , 
but it was kind of like , uh , gross , kind of like , uh , silence of the lambs , like . 
uh , no , 
and uh , it was kind of , 
i don't know , 
it's kind of both , i guess , 
but it's not as bad as silence of the lambs . 
oh , really ? 
but , uh , it's just as suspenseful , i think . 
and it was a real good movie . 
and then we saw beauty and the beast .
oh , yeah . 
oh , i've seen , uh , on t v , 
but i , 
 but , uh , those were okay , 
but we've rented some videos . 
oh , yeah , 
i like to rent movies , too . 
and i think the last one i rented was , uh , mortal thoughts 
oh , i didn't see that . 
and , uh , that's okay . 
that's pretty good . 
oh , and , uh , what about bob ? 
i have seen that 
yeah , 
we rented that one . 
that was cute . 
and , uh , uh , i guess that's about it . 
have you rented any movies lately ? 
and , uh , 
oh , yeah , 
that was good . 
we rented that one , too . 
i liked that . 
i like michael j . fox a lot . 
he's one of my favorites . 
i like his movies . 
so , do you go to the movies often , 
i hadn't been to the movies for a really long time 
but , uh , there's been movies out that i've been wanting to see . 
i just , you know , don't get a chance to get out and see them . 
well , we have two little kids , 
so it's hard for us to get out and go to the movies . 
we have to dig up a babysitter 
and  , 
oh i see . 
so  , our time is scarce . 
but , uh , we're big movie people 
and i don't know about the last movie i've seen on t v that was real good . uh , 
oh , i watched that movie with , uh , barbara , uh , uh , 
what was her name . 
oh , bar , 
that , uh , her sister got killed 
and , uh , she had a baby . 
the husband was a dentist 
and he had murdered her . 
oh , yeah , 
that was pretty good . 
oh , valerie bertinelli . 
i can't , 
that's it , 
yeah , 
that was real good , 
i saw that uh , two part series , 
and i heard it was a true story . 
i think that was probably the last movie i've seen , too . 
mother , wife , murderer . 
did you see that one ? 
did you see that one , 
that was really good . 
that was supposed to be a true story , too . 
guess a couple weeks ago or something like that . 
that was pretty good . 
i like , uh , the true stories . 
they're more interesting . 
and it's hard to believe that , you know , this really happened . 
i know . 
some of them are pretty bad . 
huh . well  ,
if you're ever in town , we'll go see a movie .
and we don't really , 
do you all still have driveins up there 
do you have them there ? 
how you doing kevin ? 
fine , thanks .
glad to hear that . 
i understand , 
are you a total banner ? 
and so that they're not playing with it and so that they can't hurt themselves or anyone else playing with it . 
i think that education with a gun is critical and important . 
uh , however , i do believe that , uh , guns ought to be maintained and controlled that you can't go out and just buy one off the corner and do whatever you want with it because people that are angry or have concerns or want to seek vengeance right away have easy access to guns 
and in the heat of the moment , they can go and do some damage that can hurt themselves and other people , 
so on a scale of one to ten , in the six or seven or eight . 
but , i think that there ought to be some control , 
but i still think that , uh , individuals have a right . 
how do you feel about it ? 
well , so , let me make sure , 
so you think that , uh , maybe a five day waiting period for handguns or that stuff would be legitimate ? 
well , i don't know if a five day waiting period would be legitimate . 
uh , uh , that might cool down some tempers . 
i think a one day would be sufficient . 
the reason i say that is there is an awful lot of people who go to gun shows 
and if you see an awful lot of exhibits and things and if you would like to purchase a gun , if that five day waiting period were in effect , you wouldn't be able to purchase one at that gun show . 
uh , you would be able to buy it , 
but they'd just have to mail it to you , i suppose , huh . 
well , i don't think you can mail guns through the mail . 
i don't know . 
i think that's against the law ever since kennedy was assassinated .
oh , yeah ? 
so , how do you feel about guns ? 
let's see , 
i think that gun control has come up because there has been some crazies that killed people with guns 
and i think that's the problem that we need to address is why these people want to kill other people rather than the instrument they particularly used in the assault 
whether , you know , 
well , do you think that there will continue to always be crazies ? 
then , uh , how do you propose that we prohibit those types of individuals from gaining access to guns ? 
well , we have some laws on the books that , uh , don't allow convicted felons to purchase guns , if i understand correctly . 
and , uh , i would agree , 
a short waiting period would be appropriate to , uh , take care of the heat of the moment type things , 
and a total ban on guns would just leave guns in the hands of criminals who don't care what the rules are anyway . 
an automatic handgun ? 
the only purpose for handguns is to shoot people , in my opinion . 
or you could do it just for fun , you know , kind of like a game , 
but , uh , 
well , i think that the police , uh , or law enforcement have a need because of the tight quarters they might find themselves , 
but , the public , i don't know . 
i think that i should have a right to own a handgun . 
not a automatic , semiautomatic . 
not an uzi .
uh , but i think a person needs a way of defending themselves . 
you saw indiana jones , 
the guy came after him with that big knife . 
and he took care of it , 
just one shot . 
that's true , 
and he , uh , saved himself in the process also . 
 that's right . 
so how is work going ? 
very fine , 
although down here in texas , uh 
that's still 
can they be , 
or does it have to , 
has to be on the hip ? 
has to be in sight so uh , you know , that you're not , uh , a menace or 
can a s , 
how about where you live there in utah ? 
what do you think of our space budget 
and should we go ahead and keep exploring , 
or should we call a halt to it , 
is it doing any good ? 
i think that the space program has done a lot of good for the country . 
now i think uh , to the current generation of space craft , the reusable ones , like they are now 
and i think some of the earlier approaches were uh , much better in many ways . 
however , uh , you know , we've gained an awful lot from the space program , all the way from remote monitoring to teflon to , uh , some new space age materials , plastics and all that . 
so i think it's been a good investment . 
uh , somebody was telling me the return was about twentyfive or thirty dollars for every dollar spent 
oh , really . 
 oh , yes . 
wish our post office could do that .
i wish the post office would just stop raising our rates . 
that's right . 
i wish they'd just deliver stuff . 
i think , though , uh , oh , i don't know , the guilt that we had out of , uh , challenger , 
i think maybe we can 
but , i don't know . 
i don't think we really have all of our act together yet as far as clear objectives . 
i agree . 
the space station's where we should go 
i agree . 
seems like that we've kind of gotten side tracked with putting all these different things up there to monitor 
you know , you know , and i'm in favor of , you know , getting closer to seeing certain things , 
but i'd like to see them also you know , go back up there , see , you know , what they can do . see about setting a space station up . 
i'm all in favor of the space program , 
and i don't think we should stop , 
and i don't think we should cut the money . 
well , where do you think we ought to go with it ? 
you talking about , uh , uh , a fully manned space station that we'll keep up there ? 
i'd like for us to really find out more about the actual universe and get up there and see what's going on , even if , you know , there's no life up there or anything , you know . 
but who knows . 
and i would like to see them do something like that . 
 i hate to see them just , you know , keep getting diverted off to spying on other nations and putting up defense things 
and , of probably what they're supposed to be doing . 
and , uh , 
you know , let's go back to our original thing with , you know , our experiments and all and all that , 
and , you know , with russia , uh , seemingly not going to be as big a threat . 
well , it can't afford to .
huhuh , you know . 
have you gone out to , uh , fort worth to see the soviet space exhibit ? 
it's only going to be there a couple of more weeks . 
we need to go . 
we went , uh , 
we took our grandsons and went , uh , the weekend before last , 
and it is marvelous . 
i mean , it's really neat how they have done it . 
they have done a beautiful job . 
have they ? 
and they have a , uh , scaled down model showing uh , oh , the fuel trucks and things run out there to it and how they , uh , 
all the things that are against the actual uh , space ship , you know , how they fall away from it , 
and the loading of it 
oh , yes . 
 and then it's actually , you know , 
the smoke comes out like it's taking off . 
it is really interesting . 
well , maybe i need to run out there this weekend . 
you really do . 
it's well worth the time and effort . 
we went , uh , early on sunday . 
we got out there about , uh , ten , ten thirty , 
 and the , 
 now do you have to have tickets ahead ? 
excuse me . 
and if you have children , if you go to mcdonald's , they have coupons , or did have . 
now they may be through with them now . 
but , uh , buy one adult 
and one child gets in free . 
um , i think both of my kids are too old for that 
oh , okay , 
 they're both , uh , 
you have teenagers or something . 
yes , 
well i had grandchildren so between their mother and their grandfather and i , 
because their dad was at work 
and , uh , 
did you , 
they really did like it . 
it's very impressive , i'm sure . 
and i felt the , uh , six year old that he'd be kind of bored , 
but he wasn't . 
even the three year old enjoyed it 
 because they had one of those moon vehicles 
so it was really neat . 
well , see , that's something else . 
the russians have had space stations for years now . 
you know , they had the merv 
 and see we've yet to keep anyone up over 
well , in going through it , i got the impression that actually they were farther ahead , 
to improve it ? 
well , i saw a program uh , recently , 
and it said every time they cut , you know , like fiftyfive million dollars on a certain thing , then they brag about how much money they cut , 
and then they go and spend that money somewhere else 
 and that's why the budget is never balanced . 
the gramm rudman act didn't solve the problem . 
they just take all the money that they say they cut 
and they spend it somewhere else 
 or you know , they pad out their staff , or , you know , spend it in bounced checks at the ,
uh , yeah , 
i'm getting uh , uh , you know , the fact that they're counting a reduced deficit as being some big step . 
i mean , first of all , this proposed budget has the largest deficit ever , 
and , two , is as far from a balanced budget , 
you reduce the deficit , 
you're still overspending . 
i mean , it's just the amount that you're overspending , 
and this is , you know , for some reason , the way that the reporting is going on now , 
it seems like the goal is to reduce the deficit to some , you know , still outrageous amount , um , .
the , uh , 
well i mean , it seems to be kind of inherent in the political process , right , that you've got , uh , people , you know , trying to corner money for their state or for their constituents so that they can get reelected . 
and , uh , there isn't any sort of overall accountability , 
and , uh , i don't know , 
is exposure and information . 
and i don't know that in general the american people are that interested , you know , to listen to as much , uh , uh , you know , 
i mean , you're going to have to know what people are doing , their motives are 
let me grab some of this money for my state now , 
and then we can throw in some highway bill , 
or you can throw in you know , some other kind of thing , 
and , uh , it's a pretty uh , vicious cycle . 
i don't know . 
well , i think one six year term . 
that's being batted around . 
proponent of that . 
he , uh 
and don't let them come back , 
and , uh , keep congress to , um , two terms of two years a piece 
 and then it'll be overturning 
and they won't have the same people there all the time 
 and then , all the special interest groups will have to renegotiate all of their 
and that'll keep them busy enough so that they won't have as much influence . 
uh , the fact that they're always trying to lean somebody toward one way or another , whether it's the oil companies , or the automotive companies , and like the air bag thing . 
the air bag came out , what , twenty years ago . 
and only now they're getting that put in cars . 
and the oil companies really aren't responsible , you know . 
the valdez proved that , 
and then the government doesn't jump on them hard enough to make them do anything . 
it should have been done immediately . 
i think that that's probably right , 
because in terms of long term , you just got to get people , um , 
i mean , uh , at one point , at least on a local level , um , going into politics is really trying to serve the community 
i mean , you don't expect to make any money out of it . 
you know , maybe you gain a little bit of local fame , 
uh , you put in a lot of work in exchange for that . 
and i don't have the feeling that national level politicians are at all like that . 
they listen to wherever the money is . 
and , uh , you know , i think inept politicians 
they're not as efficient , 
that's for sure . 
but on the other hand , maybe that's , 
all right . 
um , we have small children , two and four 
 and so our dining is very limited .
i bet you're mcdonald's fan . 
are you ? 
gosh , where do you go , whataburger ? 
um , we're more 
oh is that right ? 
and the kids just love everything that's there , 
so we're pretty fortunate . 
kind of , um , buffet style , uh , 
so you can 
that's good . 
and the food's already served 
and you don't have to wait , 
and it's already in front of them when you sit down , 
and things like , um , souper salads , you know , 
again it's buffet , 
and it's already prepared 
and any eating area that you just don't have to wait an extreme amount of time . 
i can understand that . 
we got three kids , too , 
and when the kids are small , if you going to wait , you don't go out . 
they won't put up with that . 
we tried a bennigan's one time , 
and it was terrible . 
course it was just probably one of the worst days to go anyway . 
we waited almost fortyfive minutes before everything was brought out , 
and we were ready 
and they waited fortyfive minutes ? 
i don't doubt that one bit . 
so , we rarely go eat in those kind of eating , uh , situations , any more . 
but we do love to eat out , 
um , and we do it as often as we can , 
we try and catch , um , some things that we normally wouldn't do , you know . 
where do you like to go when you got a babysitter ? 
oh , um , let me see , uh , for new year's we went to eat at uncle julio's . 
where's that ? 
never heard of that place . 
it's , um , on walnut and greenville . 
what's the name of that again ? 
it's called uncle julio's . 
what kind of ? 
um , basically mexican food . 
and it's supposed to be very similar to , um , uh , 
what is that restaurant off of central ? 
um , it's a mexican restaurant off of central . 
well , there's a zillion of them . 
have you ever been to mercado juarez ? 
that's a good place 
they've got one in addison too , now , 
but the original was on northwest highway , uh , just west of loop twelve . 
that's a good mexican place . 
good , good prices , good , good food there . 
if you like mexican stuff . it's a good place . 
we like , um , seafood , also , 
and , uh . 
you ever been to vincent's ? 
that's a good seafood place . 
you ever tried a place called louisiana purchase ? 
well , this is in plano . 
they might have another one , 
but it's on , uh , parker and central expressway 
 and , it's ca , 
oh , okay , 
i've seen it . 
it's cajun type stuff . 
if you like it kind of hot , that 
that's good stuff . 
we've been to , um , chefalia's . 
it's basically the same thing , seafood 
where's that place ? 
that's in addison , off of belt line . 
belt line and what ? 
like or it's 
and , um , excellent food . 
we got this premier dining card thing , 
and we've been going to all sorts of weird type places with it . 
what is that ? 
well , you get , uh , one free 
and you pay for one now , and 
oh , really . 
and , uh , 
there's a swan club which is out central and campbell . 
uh , if you like continental stuff , that is really nice . 
talk your husband into taking you there some night . 
i mean it's not a cheap place , 
but , uh , it's very nice . 
and where is that ? 
uh , it's north of campbell , but , uh , off central , uh 
 oh , it used to be a northern telecom building in the ground floor . 
i don't know what they call it now , 
northern telecom kind of moved over in their own building . 
but northwest side of campbell and , just before you get to campbell 
 and it's in the lower floor , 
but it's really a nice restaurant 
and , tell him to take you there for your anniversary , 
and then they got a place where you can dance , you know , and all that kind of stuff . 
well , my birthday's coming up , 
there you go . 
all right . 
you got one coming . 
i need an excuse .
have you ever been to ewaldes 
now there's , if you like cont , 
i like continental stuff , myself . 
my wife doesn't necessary like that stuff , 
but i like that . 
and that's down in the stoneleigh hotel now . 
and that is really super kind of stuff , too . if you like continental at all 
either one of those two , you go through a hundred bucks without half trying , 
but it's 
oh , oh . 
oh , you don't have to spend that much , 
i'm kidding you . 
so , how do you use your credit cards ? 
oh , we use them for ,
so we use it quite a bit 
 but we pay off every month , though , 
so we never have to pay interest 
and the credit cards if there's a monthly , or a yearly charge . 
we always get it through our bank or somewhere where it's free . 
so we never have to pay anything extra . 
that's me . 
i won't use one that i have to pay an annual fee 
we just don't think it's worth it . 
 you know , and , um , i use it , well , to buy my gas with , 
my shell credit card , i use that , 
and then like my emporium card and , uh , weinstocks card , i use that , 
but i'm like you . 
i usually pay it off as soon as i get my bill . 
why i don't just write a check , i don't know . 
see , well , i don't do it either .
you know , it's just really weird , 
but i don't carry a lot of cash with me , because i'm 
that's how i fe , 
i mean , it's a rare day when i even have seventyfive cents in my purse . 
you know , enough for a phone call 
and that's about all . 
but , uh , other than that , that's the way i use them . 
i know some people that uses them so bad that every one of them that they've got , they can't charge any more ,
and i think that's terrible . 
because if you have good credit , you know , it helps you in the long run when you want to go make a 
 oh , yeah . 
because if anything ever happens that you do need to , you know , you have excellent credit , 
why , it really does help . 
and i think it's more convenient , too , in a lot of cases , 
like whenever we go on trips , we always , you know , use our visa or our mastercard or whatever . 
  . eah . 
and then , um , you know , we really don't have to pay for it out of our own pockets until about a month later 
 and so it helps us gain interest in the bank when we do it , 
we come out even a little bit ahead because we've been able to use whatever , first off , and then pay 
well , i think it's better to use credit cards , too , like i say , because there's so many people around any more that's watching what you're doing 
oh , yeah . 
 and if you pull a wad of money out of your pocket , they're going to hit you over the head . 
even if it's five bucks , even . 
i know . 
somebody's always watching . 
so , i don't carry money . 
i'd just soon use my credit cards and 
and also , if someone did happen to steal your credit card , my husband was saying that if , you know , you notice it within , i think it's twentyfour hours , you can report it in , 
and he said the most you'd ever have to pay is fifty dollars for them to cancel , you know , whatever payments you had , 
and if 
and then 
and , you know , some of those stores don't even seem to check your signature or anything 
i know . 
i don't know why they don't , unless you have to spend a certain amou , 
i don't know , 
but i notice that some of them don't even look , you know , 
they just slide it in there and pass it back to you 
so i don't think that's right . 
i think they should check it to make sure that the signature at least matches , you know . 
i mean it's just a precaution for everybody . 
well , let's see , 
what else can i say about credit cards . 
um . 
oh , i also like to use discover when i can , because they give you some money back every year . 
i don't , uh , 
that's that sears discovery card , 
is that what that ? 
yeah . 
 now i don't have that one , you know . 
well , we just started doing that , 
it comes in handy for when you're buying things like , um , tickets for the train or , um , airplanes 
and it's only a little bit , 
but , i mean , it's still something . 
we got two fifty last year 
 and so you know , it helps out here and there . 
oh , you mean , uh , for your using your credit card you get like a rebate or something ? 
but you've charged up on the discover card for a year 
 and they give you a half percent of that , 
and that adds up to , you know , two fifty or something . 
oh , i see . 
and so that's what , 
and i know we're going to get back more this year , because you know , we spent a little bit more 
and they do it for how long you've been a member i think , too 
um , i see . 
 and they increase the percentage a little bit . 
well , i'll ,
