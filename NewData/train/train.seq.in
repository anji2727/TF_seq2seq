i guess , 
does it say something ? 
i think it usually does . 
you might try , uh , 
i don't know , 
hold it down a little longer , 
and see if it , uh , 
it seemed like it did , 
but it might not . 
she just had a baby , 
he's about five months old 
and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and 
do you have kids ? 
oh , really ? 
i do .
yes , uh , 
i don't work , though , 
but i used to work when i had two children . 
i work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit , 
but i don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care . 
but , does your sister live in a big community ? 
uh , yeah 
it's a fairly large community . 
she , uh , got real lucky , though . 
he had a boss who , uh , moved into a larger office 
 and she's able to take her baby to work with her . 
oh , really ? 
and it's a small office that she works in 
 and , uh , office , 
and it's just one lawyer 
 and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office . 
there's no one else that works there . 
and so they have an extra room and everything for the baby , 
so it works out pretty good for her . 
how lucky .
i know a lot of people around here sometimes have , like , mothers or grandmothers 
but , the community i'm in is not a real large one , 
so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that , you know , 
you either know them or know somebody who knows them  , to get to , 
so it's fairly safe . 
to get references and that , 
but , uh , 
simply because there's so many kids and so many  , 
worried that they're not going to get enough attention ? 
and they're expensive 
and , course , there's a lot of different types of day care available , too , you know , where they teach them academic things . 
or they just watch them and let them play and things like that , 
take a long time to find the right place 
it's going to be the right place or not . 
anything , i guess , could happen . 
i guess after he , you know , gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care . 
yeah . 
when she can't keep control of him 
and he starts crawling 
it would be hard , 
i think it would be kind of stressful . 
it would be nice to have him around 
 but , uh , seems like , you know , 
what if he cried at the wrong time 
i think she has problems with that , too . 
well , when you have kids , will you work ? 
do you 
i don't know 
that's something i've considered . uh , 
i always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time . 
is that what you do ? 
uh , yeah . 
so i'm here all the time . 
oh , so they don't go to school . 
is it like , uh , 
oh , what's that called , 
it's , uh , correspondence school , 
they do it 
that's interesting . 
do you have to have any special training ? 
it depends on the state you live actually . 
some laws absolutely prohibit it . 
some states , uh , say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that . 
our state doesn't yet , say that 
and i'm not a certified teacher . 
i went to college , 
levels right now 
and so , 
so they haven't been to public schools at all . 
one of them was for a couple of years 
and so , you know , my oldest , he was , 
and then my youngest two have never been . 
so anyway , 
but we don't , 
so , you've never had , 
well , uh , does the company you work for test for drugs ? 
but , uh , since then requests that we do that . 
how about you ? 
uh , no , 
our policies and procedures manual , uh , the furthest it goes about drugs is in kind of the miscellaneous section , or 
it says , use of narcotics on company premises . 
so that's pretty general , 
but , uh , i work for an environmental management firm 
 and i'm an engineer there , 
but i do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites , 
but i don't operate any machinery . 
now , people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that 
because they're at a higher risk of exposure 
and blood screening is part of that 
and i think that drugs , 
they do test for drugs in that capacity , 
but it's not their exclusive , 
it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for . 
but i think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field . 
what is the nature of your company's business ? 
well , it's actually , uh , 
we do oil well services . 
so , a lot of our clients are big oil companies , 
and they go out to , 
we have engineers who , uh , go out and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff , 
so the clients are very concerned that , you know , the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy , because they're on their , you know , territory and everything , 
and i work in the software , uh , house , 
and everybody there , you know , are all software engineers . 
the oil rigs or anything , 
and yet , to , 
well , a little different , actually , 
but , uh , you know , we have to go through the same thing , 
 , than a lot of drug policies . 
in our case , it's like , when you hire on , they'll test you , 
and then if you get injured on the job , if you like trip and fall or something , uh , they give you a drug test right away . 
oh , really ? 
other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that , 
but , a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first . 
particularly , like  , uh , we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol , 
and they didn't find any problem with that , you know , 
an issue , uh , in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening . 
in fact , they'll have these little parties , 
and people will just get , 
i mean , i've , 
my brother lives where i work , 
and i have many a time called him to come get me , you know . 
you know , they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg .
but , uh , i think drug testing , 
and i don't know , 
i think it's got some relevance , 
but i think its relevance is pretty limited . 
i mean , i think , you know , 
in your case , i don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing . 
i think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident . 
it's really bizarre . 
uh , particularly , like where we are , you know . 
there was a story of a woman last year and like sprained her ankle 
and she was a personnel secretary 
and she had to get tested 
and , i don't know 
i'm ambivalent about the whole thing . 
you know , i have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand , it's like if , you know , 
they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense 
and , you know , it's like i mean , employments are contractual by nature anyway 
 but , uh , i had an experience when i was interviewing for a job where i had to , uh , uh , do a drug test 
it was kind of a long story , 
but it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what i went through , 
and it amounted to , uh , going in , uh , before any of these interviews , 
i'm not even working for this company , 
i'm going in for , like , interviews 
and they flew me out to chicago 
and , uh , before i went into any of the interviews , uh , they took me to the doctor to give me a physical . 
they said it was going to be a physical , you know , 
and , uh , actually beforehand they told me they were going to , uh , do drug screening , 
but i had forgotten about that , 
and so , basically , i'd already peed off in that morning 
i wasn't , like , able to give a full sample , 
and so 
the procedure is utterly humiliating . 
you go in there with the doctor , 
he makes you take off all your clothes 
and then he examines you . 
uh , the question was kind of interesting to me because i was just trying to put together a , uh , long term financial plan and monthly budget . 
the only thing i do now is , uh , put the data into quicken . 
i don't know if you are familiar with that . 
and , uh , i've considered using it once myself , 
but i decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date . 
so i kind of gave up on the idea of using quicken , at least for now . 
um . i've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then , well , uh , uh , not bother to total it 
 and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic . 
so it really helps with that . 
well , it's similar problems 
but , uh , we just have the one check book 
and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible 
and occasionally we will get behind like you say 
but , uh , it doesn't really seem to be up to date and balanced . 
well , how to you handle that , the long range or medium range planning on finances ? 
well , actually we haven't had to . uh , until just recently . 
i guess we've got a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way 
we try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that . 
well that's pretty good if you can do that . 
i know . 
i have a daughter who's ten 
and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point 
but , uh , we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away 
so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction 
and then the money that i will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund . 
um . sounds good . 
i guess we're just at the point , uh , 
my wife worked until we had a family 
and then , you know , now we're just going on the one income 
so it's 
find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to , uh , do it . 
you know , kind of enforce the savings . 
but , uh , it will be interesting to see  .
well our situation is just kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently , uh , took on a full time job , well almost full time . 
so , it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for , uh , long range goals like college and sickness and 
that sounds good . 
but , uh , uh , i was just curious , what , uh , part of the country . 
oh , stockton . 
oh , okay . 
how about you ? 
uh , cincinnati , actually . 
i was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with , uh , the western accents or something like that . 
uh , uh , actually , uh , i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by , uh , reading telecom digest 
or was there another ? 
uh , a colleague of mine at , uh , work got some information over , uh , the computer network called internet . 
oh , okay . 
that is how i got it as well 
but , uh , 
and he just forwarded that on to me 
and , uh , it sounded like it would be an interesting project 
so i 
it will be interesting to see what , 
uh , probably need to try to get back on the topic 
but , uh , it's hard to talk about finances without getting to , uh , dollar figures i guess 
well what other long range goals do you have besides college ? 
uh , well i think , either my wife or i would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point 
 uh , i guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that . 
it seems like every year my employer just gives back , you know , a little bit your tuition reimbursement . 
i mean they use to reimburse one hundred percent 
and uh , now it's reimbursement depending on the grade you get in class 
and , uh , it's a real shame from what we had before , uh , because we're , 
uh , actually i lived over in europe for a couple of years , 
i lived in germany 
and in germany they don't have the jury system . 
what they do is they have , uh , three judges , basically . 
and you get up there 
and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence 
and your defense attorney presents their evidence 
and those three guys take the evidence , go off , figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not . 
our judicial system is in such total chaos . 
i think what they need to do is , they need to somehow take the money out of it . 
i mean , when you have a man that's signed a statement saying he's guilty , 
we have a family called all day family . 
they were all murdered . 
all the people signed confessions , 
they went to a trial by jury . 
they been trying these people now for twentytwo years , ever since i was a child . 
and what they've done is they've bought mercedes after mercedes after mercedes is what they've done , 
has nothing to do with justice whatsoever . 
 well , you know , it's one of those things , 
i mean , uh , uh , i would have to look at it . 
uh , just the judges , the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight 
because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day , they know all the procedures , 
they know what's good and what isn't , 
you can't use this as , uh , evidence , you know , because it was either illegally obtained or whatever 
and , you know , you wouldn't have this , uh , uh , theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the jury 
disregard that . 
any jury's not going to disregard the evidence , you know .
uh , that's true . 
i think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself . 
that may very well be . 
i hold it in the utmost contempt . 
my favorite is the police department , 
they're not aimed at the criminal . 
the judicial system is aimed at the citizens 
because you and i , we have work schedules , 
we can be called at work , 
we have social security numbers , 
they can trace us down , 
we have telephones , 
then we have checkbooks . 
criminals have none of these things . 
they're real difficult to catch , 
and if they do catch them , they don't get any monetary gain out of it , whereas we write a check . 
so where do you think they target their efforts ? 
that's true . 
you d , 
they target their efforts toward the citizens 
 you know , that's a , 
i've nailed the problem down 
but i , 
leave the details up to somebody else , huh . 
i'm going to have to leave those details like , what would you do about , 
i think , to begin with , you would have , 
like , here in atlanta area , our crime rate is just astronomical , 
yet , you go out on the streets 
and they're giving speeding tickets . 
i think somehow you have to separate the revenues from , 
well , you know , uh , talking about the lawyers , you know what might very well uh , a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that , is to set the fees for cases . 
it's kind of like like , uh , v c r or television repair . 
and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it , then he eats it . 
he repairs it , gives it back to you , and takes your hundred dollars . 
now , if he comes in and says , you know , i'll repair your v c r , or somebody else's v c r , for a hundred dollars , gets in there , 
maybe it's a blown fuse , 
takes him two minutes , 
he fixes it , 
he still charges you that hundred dollars . 
so , maybe if we did that with the lawyers , so that , you know , whether it's a murder case or uh , somebody suing somebody else , you get x dollars for that case 
and that's it . 
none of this , 
because when you get the most heinous of crimes , have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney ? 
oh , yeah . 
and here's this bum that didn't have a job 
 and he's got a attorney that you and i could never afford . 
that's true . 
um , you know , .
and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it 
that's right . 
you know it's amazing 
they're all former lawyers . 
well , that's another problem . 
i think to really correct the judicial system , you have to get the lawyers out of it .
i mean , they're totally and morally bankrupt without any ethics whatsoever , 
and with that type person running it , i mean , you could expect that you , 
so i know what they've said . 
uhhuh . 
well , i'm trying to think . 
my , uh , uh , wife's grandmother had alzheimer's 
and they were going to put her into a nursing home 
and , uh , when they put her in , she had all kinds of trouble 
and the nursing home made them come was being a nuisance . or worse than a nuisance , 
i mean 
 oh they thought it was too much of a bother . 
and they couldn't deal with her .
so , i guess you need to , uh , know whether it's you know , a no deposit , no return kind of thing whether  , 
if they're equipped to handle the kind of patients you're going to have 
because i know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still . 
they wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her 
but they wanted to be independent as well .
my grandmother actually was in a nursing home that , uh , 
there was a retirement hotel and then a , uh , 
there was some sort of fulltime care place that was also associated with it 
so for , uh , the first few years she had her own apartment and , you know , made her own meals sometimes . but could also go and eat someplace else . 
and then , uh , as she became less able to take care of herself , then she moved into this other part that was able to , uh , provide fulltime care 
and , uh , she didn't have to do anything anymore . 
but my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly . 
and that's som , 
i don't know whether that's because they , you know , sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the reason is . 
but i think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something . 
well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help . 
they need health care 
so they're already ill before they go . 
that's probably a large factor . 
if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you , then you stay where you are . 
then you only go there as a last resort . 
or people send you there as a last resort . 
that's what my grandparents , 
it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened , there was somebody there for them . 
so that was their thinking . 
somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency . 
and also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make .
i guess that's a problem too for people . wait lists and all . 
i guess . 
that , uh , 
you can't always get in when you want too 
and of course , you can't just sit around and wait . 
when you need it , you need it 
and the money is also another issue . how you're going to pay for it . 
at that stage of life you only have so much money left 
and i guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings . 
 i mean it is kind of fair , 
but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise . 
so it's another problem . 
and if it were you , you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price . 
so , it's just so complicated anymore , i think .
people outlive their savings . 
and , with medicine being the way it is , you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down 
and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore . 
well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing . 
it's just a shame that's the way it has to be . 
i think 
and cause like if your spouse died ,   all alone , it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you .
i've known quite a few people that have , uh , gone to retirement communities . 
i don't know if they have them back there 
but here in california and in ari , 
uh , so , what do you think , uh , about putting the elderly in a nursing home ? 
well , i think that on the individual basis . 
uh , sometimes there is no alternative . 
uh , you do not have , uh , uh , family available or family that's , uh , 
you may not even have family you know , who are around . 
that's true . 
so , sometimes it's not an alternative . 
uh , but i think also , sometimes it can be , uh , a benefit if it's for a short time . 
sometimes in a nursing home 
 uh , especially if it's after an acute illness . 
to get over a , 
or to rehab after , uh , an illness . 
that's true . 
i never thought of that . 
 you know , sometimes the nursing homes are good for , uh , just short periods of time . 
that's true , 
until they get over that hump 
 because too often the acute hospitals are sending them out much faster than what they're 
they really are . 
they don't like to keep them 
uh , sometimes too , it's used as a dumb job . 
you know 
what do you mean ? 
and they don't want to take the responsibility 
so they will put them in a nursing home . 
that's true . 
there's both sides to it too . 
what do you think ? 
and it depends on how sick the person is too . what you're capable of , like if you have a family to take care of , you know , of your own .
yeah , 
uh , i would personally like it 
if my parents were to get ill , i would like to take care of them at home and if i had the money with some help . 
that's not always possible . 
that's true . 
but , uh , to the best of my ability , i'd like to do it until it gets impossible .
i think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to , 
there's not a choice , it's 
either medicare or insurance to cover it . 
that's true . 
but i think nursing homes can be good . 
it just depends on what kind they are . 
you know , you need to check them out ahead of time . 
and then there's also some that are set up for specialties 
 uh , i know some . 
unfortunately , some elderly or have , i guess it's alzheimer's or where 
that they're  , 
and you need a special nursing home for that . 
you need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around 
 and you need people who are trained for that type 
who know what they're doing with that . 
so there's different types of nursing homes i think . 
well , my , uh , grandmother's not really in a nursing home , but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it . 
 and she really liked the idea of moving there . 
she's not ill yet 
 but , uh , she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years 
and then she decided she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden . 
she's very independent . 
 so she's in this nursing home . 
it's out in the country 
and , uh , she really enjoys it right now .
gives her a little bit of her own independence 
 but she still has , uh , a security there . 
some support . 
and then there's also , uh , sort of a wing for those people that do get sick 
and , what i like about it and i think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now 
and then , so if she ever does become ill , uh , it will be like family around her . 
that's right 
 and i 
and also they have a lot of , uh , activities going on for the ones 
so it's not sort of like , uh , uh 
she loves it . 
she has a great social life 
and she travels 
and , uh , it's in the mountains 
and it's beautiful 
and , uh , .
oh definitely it's , 
 and , uh , you know , sometimes those choices can be made in advance 
and sometimes 
so , uh , do you happen to be working for a large firm ? 
well , it's about three hundred and fifty people . 
i guess that's not large compared to some , 
but it's big enough . 
and they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything 
and i wish they did . 
you know , they have a four o one k , 
but i put all the money into it . 
they don't add anything . 
what about you ? 
uh , i work for a fairly large company . 
it's got eight thousand people . 
and , uh , we do have health insurance . 
we don't have four o one k plan , stuff like that , 
but we do have , like , retirement . 
they kind of match up to , you , 
if you put six percent , they match up to six percent , 
and then the rest is whatever you want to put in . if you put more than that or something like that . 
oh , that's a pretty good deal . 
it's not bad . 
now , how long does it take for your contribution to vest ? 
god , i don't know . 
i'm sure it's not till like twentyfive years , thirty years . 
the place i work at's , health insurance is kind of expensive . 
it's like hundred bucks a month or something 
huh , well , i guess what we have is you get like a certain amount of dollars 
and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need . 
otherwise hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money , you know , put in your paycheck . 
we have one of those use it or lose it plans , too , where , uh , they'll basically pay for , uh , you know , child care type , uh , expenses . 
i uh , can send in a request for payment 
uh , and they'll send me , you know a check for the amount they withheld . 
that's pretty good , you know . 
uh , it saves a third off on taxes or something . 
yeah  , 
well , it depends on which company you work for . 
i know that , like , uh , think you call it plan d .
deductibles are really high , 
it's like fifteen hundred dollars , 
but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because amount of money , you know . 
so , you know , someone did start a cost benefit analysis , 
and ends up the best is to take a high deductible whatever it happens to be , if you happen to be a healthy individual .
uh , on the other hand , you know , had a similar health plan 
and , uh , one of my kids was in a car accident 
and , uh 
you mean , not even your car insurance ? 
well , it got all screwed up because i had a high deductible on the health insurance , no fault here , 
car insurance 
and then you know , we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and .
 oh , well . 
yeah  , 
uh , well , i don't know , 
i think other than health insurance , i think , uh , you know , an extra week of , uh , time off would be nice . 
i only get two weeks . 
my place you get two weeks when you start 
and then every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks . 
oh , that's nice . 
we don't get them till your seventh year of service till 
that's a long time . 
it's , uh , 
especially in the kind of engineering job i'm in , you know , companies don't stay afloat that long  , 
 and they , 
 uh , with the telecommunications type of company , supposedly you , used to be much more stable . 
it's a lot less stable than it used to be . 
they used to have job security crap , 
but now they don't . 
so , i don't know , 
it's , uh , no longer .
so that's what , 
i think it's still based on the old model of , 
and now they don't , uh , 
a lifelong job security 
all that stuff , huh . 
i don't think so . 
uh , hearing a lo , 
they're always laying people off , which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security . 
i mean , does it , 
oh , i don't know , 
we haven't been doing layoffs . 
we've been doing , uh , down sizing with , uh , getting rid of extra layers of management . 
and , uh , i don't know what they do for those people . 
mean the management they get rid of ? 
some of it , 
there's too many chiefs and not enough indians 
oh , they put , 
well , have you ever served on a jury ? 
i've been called , 
but i had to beg off from the duty . 
and you ? 
and then i was not chosen . 
well , i was , uh , originally chosen primarily , i think , because i was a young fellow 
and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict . 
i don't know why . 
something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago . 
oh , really ? 
and they kind of liked me . 
i looked conser , and all that stuff 
and they , 
i don't know what they saw in me , 
but they saw it . 
but , uh , back to the issue , uh , 
i don't know , 
at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted , especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun . 
but , there , too , there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable , particularly , i think in civil cases . 
in criminal cases , i'd like to see the unanimity remain , 
but in civil cases , i think a majority rule by jury would be sufficient . 
well , uh , could you give me an example of a case where you think that ? 
well , in a criminal case , say one in which , you know , there is , like , say assault or some such . i think there ought to be a unanimous , uh , vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this . 
and in civil law there , you know , is such a thing as like , let's say , uh , misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that . 
a majority rule , i think , would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases . 
i don't know if i'm making any sense or not . 
well , i mean , i think , 
are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more , uh , tangible 
like , for instance , say , uh , 
and also , too , i think i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more , uh , serious in a criminal case . 
well , do you think that in a civil case , if there was majority rule , that it would be easy for someone to be set up ? 
um , well , i really can't say for certain , truth be known . 
uh , as it stands , uh , civil and criminal case . 
i mean , the , uh , documentary , the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that . 
you know , i don't know if you're familiar with that or not . 
a , uh , fellow when he was much younger , uh , was tried and convicted and sentenced to death . 
fortunately , in his case , the death penalty was revoked 
his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system . 
the case was reopened 
and he was exonerated . 
well , i mean , i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served . 
many laws , but little justice . 
but , uh , 
and i also think , just like you were talking about before , why you were chosen to be on a jury that , uh , the process of picking jurors is not always objective . 
oh , certainly not , 
and  , you know , they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this , 
but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires . 
you know , the , 
because you get up 
and they ask you a few questions , 
both sides do , 
and then you're either challenged which is , 
you know , each attorney can use that as much as they like 
or , i think it's a limit now , 
they probably have a limit now , 
but , they pretty much go through that , 
and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve . 
for me , it was financial hardship , 
but , onto the thing , uh , i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing . 
it was always my impression that the justice himself , or herself , had the final say . 
i don't really know that much about the recycling in this area that we're in . 
we live in the saginaw area . 
and i'm not real familiar with , uh , anything that , 
fact as far as i know , the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here . uh , or the grocery store or anything 
the rec , 
we live in plano 
and they started off recycling by , uh , putting the , 
i think at each walmart , they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that , which now , 
i guess the , uh , city has bought the big green trash cans 
and , uh , they have a recycling truck that comes around now 
and you separate your glass and paper 
and you set it out 
and they pick it up 
and it works real neat . 
they seem to be having a real good response . 
that is pretty good . 
we're originally from another state 
and i know in the state we were from that they did that similar type thing . 
the city separate trash cans 
and you separated your stuff 
and you put it in there 
and they took it , you know . 
i don't really know . 
even or , 
they started after we moved down here 
and so 
i just know that , uh , my inlaws you know , they pick it up , 
but i don't know if they get anything back on it 
or , do you get money for it ? 
iowa and other cities like that , it's a nickel per aluminum can . 
so you don't see too many thrown out around the streets .
you know , all kinds of bottles and then when you turn them back in . 
i remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel . 
and now most of them are throwaway . 
so , maybe that's one thing they can do . 
i think now they're a lot more expensive than that . 
uh , i bought some cokes the other day in the little bottles 
and like , i know they were at least ten cents apiece . 
i started to see , at home , 
and , eight and ten packs , you know 
it was like two dollars and something for the bottles . 
it costs more for the bottles than it did for the cokes . 
that was my brother's first job in a grocery store . 
he was in the bottle area .
in the bot ,  .
it's pretty dangerous out there , you know , when they fall over , 
they say that there's a big glut 
oh , really ? 
of green glass . 
well , out in this area , they really don't have anything . 
now , i know that like minyard's 
but i do know some of these places were doing that 
and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them . 
i notice the plastic have sort of faded away , the milk jugs . 
people just , 
they really don't , 
uh , there's too much labor involved i guess to separate the stuff . 
more than it's worth . 
i don't know , 
it can be , 
it's not as easy  ,
well , who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away .
that's right , 
it's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher . 
uh , yeah . 
we all do it .
well , it was nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
oh , i think two or three minutes is 
is that it ? 
well , it was nice talking to you 
and he's in high school , so that he could make some money . 
uh , but then it has my name on it , 
i'll sit down here and call it .
well , we're doing it for a church choir 
oh , are you ? 
oh , that's interesting . 
that's nice . 
well , thank you . 
thank you . 
so . have you heard about saturns ? 
i've heard some about saturns . 
i don't know a lot about them . 
i haven't been over , uh , to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their , uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of i guess , the japanese cars . 
ooh , that's great . 
actually that's kind of the type of car that i'm thinking about we might get . 
saturns , you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a saturn dealer .
and , uh , supposedly , they've got great customer satisfaction from what things i've heard . 
um . yeah , 
i've heard a lot of people like them . 
uh , yet i don't know whether i would buy saturn or not at this point . 
i'm kind of , 
my card and , uh , desires tend to be pretty picky 
and so , uh . 
well , like what ? 
well , let's see . 
with human beings in mind , 
and that's not just the driver and the passenger 
but that's the person who's working on it , 
cause i do almost all my own maintenance and , uh 
and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in , uh , finding a it's not very , 
almost unlikely at this point . 
and , uh , yo , 
i've got a sixtyfive mustang 
and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that , i just say i will never do that with the modern cars . 
it's not worth my time . 
you can't get in there . 
you can't do anything . 
and it's so complicated too . 
i look at it 
i'd have to almost go take a class or something like that . 
 well i've got an eightythree saab . 
and i find that for you know , everyday things . it's really very easy to work on 
and so , uh , you know , i'm kind of spoiled . 
i used to have a   chevy . 
with a three fifty in it . 
and , uh , i really liked working on it . uh , cause it was pretty easy too . 
it was about a nineteen seventy . 
so i'm kind of , uh , biased in that 
and , you know , i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore . 
and that's probably one thing i'd look at . 
i think another thing i'd look at is safety . 
that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about . 
actually , one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninetyone ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual 
that's a real nice car , i think . 
i've driven some , uh , tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips .
and i've always been very impressed with the taurus . 
it's a really nice car . 
i think  , it's a stylish car both inside and out . 
it's comfortable to drive . 
uh , reasonable performance , 
and this is out in california where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore . 
uh , i've been real impressed with that . 
and i didn't realize that they were putting dual , uh , air bags in that car now . 
or , excuse me , the ninetytwos . 
this newest model . 
you could 
 oh , i think that , 
but the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars . 
actually , contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so . 
so we're actually 
we'd like to get like a 
oh , i don't know . 
what do you call it ? 
a dealer return type thing on a ninetytwo and ninetythree or something like that you know . 
year old ninetytwo or something like that . 
those are 
 see if we , 
that would be a good deal to go with . 
and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too . 
because they looked really nice . 
in those ? 
what attracts you to the saturns ? 
or , of course , we've already talked , you know , 
the taurus is safe . 
but what kind of things are you looking for ? 
 well , the saturns you can get air bags in them . 
i don't think you can get dual side air bags . 
but one of the two things that i'm really , 
i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart . that doesn't have problems . 
you set down . 
you look at consumer reports . 
we've been pouring over consumer reports 
and you just get so depressed for the u s auto 
because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have 
 and the two cars that apparently are close to that . that actually have high reliability , the taurus is one of the highest u s cars . 
and the other one are the saturns . 
so those two things . 
and then , you know , we kind of want a four door . 
what is your , uh , community , uh , currently doing with regard to recycling ? 
uh , basically , they're just , uh , having various recycling , uh , bins , uh , located for , uh , trash pickup . 
 well that's more than we have up here in massachusetts . 
uh , in that respect 
and they do have bins set up . 
but i live in a metropolitan area 
and , uh , they're not , uh , too inclined to do something as aggressive as that .
well , here they 
uh , live in an apartment complex . 
and they only have one set of recycling bins , one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters . 
so a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because , you know , it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins . 
to do something like that because it does take extra effort . 
and i know massachusetts has , 
a bottle bill was passed 
and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now , 
and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably , believe it or not , is just to get the extra nickel at the store and not , uh , 
that's the majority of people that i know of anyways . 
where people aren't really , you know , eco conscious . it's just the fact that it's something they have to do . 
and i'm not going to throw a bottle away , 
it's like throwing a nickel away . 
that type of thing . 
 but , uh , people need to be more conscious of it . 
and a lot of people are against it . 
and it's going to create a lot more work for the stores that sell , you know , sodas and stuff . 
because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything . 
  it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans . 
uh , for it to go through . 
and it's been pretty successful 
and people notice it as far as , uh , highways being , uh , you know , 
people would have a drink of soda , 
instead of throwing out the window , they keep the bottle 
so as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth . 
but more importantly , it's recycling reusable materials back into , uh , manufacturing . 
and that's the big thing , i think , that they try to promote . 
i think here put out the trash and stuff , if they could get some kind of rebate , those people who do put the stuff out , uh , you know , and separate it , have lower collection fee or something may 
that's a good idea . 
there definitely has to be a motivation factor 
and i know that , where i work , 
i work for a defense contractor . 
and there's a big push on for recycling , uh , paper materials , you know , computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of , uh , styrofoam usage because of and the whole eco issue and that . 
and they're very proactive 
and , uh , matter of fact , they give you discounts if you use , uh , china wear rather than , uh , styrofoam stuff , 
people more conscious of it . 
i think that's what they need to do . be more proactive like that . 
uh , uh , i believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books . 
uh , usually have them come from   you know , projects to collect old ones . 
usually just get dumped out with the trash . 
and phone books are a large volume of annual trash . 
they just , 
matter of fact , that reminded me of an article i saw in the pa , 
the local schools , you could send your phone book with your kid to school 
and what they'll do is they'll recycle it . 
because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that , uh , uh , the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time . 
a guy went to and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty 
because they don't degrade over such a period of time . 
well , part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper . 
they contain the glue and stuff 
and they used to have to take out all the , uh , pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them . 
now i think they've come up with some way of , uh , pulling the glue out . 
let's see . 
how uh , let's see , about ten years ago , 
uh , what do you think was different ten years ago from now ? 
 well , i would say as , far as social changes go , uh , i think families were more together . 
they did more things together . 
uh , they ate dinner at the table together . 
uh , the parents usually took out uh , you know , more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity . 
uh , although i'm not a mother , i still think that , uh , a lot has changed since ten years ago . 
uh , what do you 
well , uh , actually ten years from today seems rather short . 
uh , but i do agree that , uh , generally society has sort of , uh , let's see , rushed everything ahead . 
and , uh , i don't know , 
it leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that . 
in other words , they just prioritize their lives differently . 
but i think that has a lot to do with economic situation . 
what about like as far as , uh , social changes in the individual ? 
um . it depends . 
uh , it's hard to say because i think people were busy ten twenty years ago too . 
uh ,  , 
well , how old are you ? 
i'm twentyeight . 
twentyeight . 
i'm twentythree . 
so there's maybe a five year gap between us . 
so , uh . 
have been busy all along . 
it's just 
and now , uh , it's pretty much an economic necessity in most places for both parents to work . 
do you think it's an economic necessity 
or do you think that we're , uh , all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living ? 
i think that's part of it too . 
but i do think , 
i mean do you think ,
but then there are a lot of people that don't have that .
i think maybe those people that really do need to work , both parents , just to survive . 
uh , but i tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive . 
so you think it's , 
which group are you saying is the one trying ? 
i'm saying that uh , the group that is just trying to survive from day to day , where both parents are working 
because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing , uh , middle class in this country 
i mean i have met people that really need the job . 
and then , sometimes a microwave , a v c r , a answering machine 
well i guess we're sticking more to social changes 
but , uh 
and not all of those are necessities . 
so they're trying to , 
it has become a necessity .
i say they , uh , 
probably the best things to do is tie them with a rope and throw them in the water 
if they sink 
i see . 
uh , so , uh , how do you feel ? 
that's , of course , being facetious 
you'd have to say that . 
uh , i don't know . 
uh , whether the judge should be the one that does the , uh , sentencing . 
and seems to me that i think that's the way it's done now . 
uh , at least ,
uh , it seems to me that the judge does it 
and the norm is 
and , i guess , also what the system will absorb .
probably more tuned in to that . 
possibly though on , uh , capital cases like maybe the death penalty 
 uh , i'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole , 
i mean he could have like a personal prejudice . 
you know , judges are people like everybody else 
that's right . 
but maybe , uh , 
 and i think that may be an exception as well . 
because i think that , 
doesn't the jury decide on the death penalty rather than the judge ? 
uh , uh , get the death penalty . 
do they have a death penalty in california ? .
and , uh , there's a big uproar going on right now . uh 
the , uh , governor , you know , has been trying to decide whether he's going to commute it or not . 
you know , it's someone who had , uh , 
something like that , i've got no problem with it . uh 
i guess the way i think about it it shouldn't necessarily be thought of as revenge . 
it's just like if you've got like a dog that's running wild and biting people 
put it to sleep , you know . 
just get it out , you know , 
it's not able to fit in , you know .
something inexpensive . 
uh , i guess ,
if somebody gets the death penalty , they're judged guilty , 
they got the death penalty , 
they should have one year and one appeal . cover all their bases with one appeal 
and if not , you know , don't let them sit up there on death row for , you know , fifteen years . 
i think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years . 
 but i guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake 
oh , i'm sure .
the other thing they asked about was whether uh , uh , the verdict should be required to be unanimous .
well maybe not . 
i don't know . 
at least in capital cases i'd think they'd have to be 
i believe it is 
i think in like , uh , lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six , whatever .
i believe that's the way it is . 
but i'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases . uh  , 
the paper here tonight had a thing about the noriega trial .
and , uh , they've only deliberated four hours or ,
and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked . 
oh , no .
and the judge told them  , 
i'm telling you , go one way or the other . 
that's probably an expensive trial . uh , 
six months so far they said . 
you know , i'm not sure there's a number . 
it's probably like thirty , forty thousand dollars a day you know , worth of all the free for all . 
maybe they could go with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their , uh , vote . 
practically forgot who noriega was , you know . 
my , uh , cousin is a f b i agent down in miami . 
oh really ? 
so she follows that stuff pretty closely . 
 but , uh , 
that's interesting . 
she's not involved in that case . 
but she does , 
well have you ever served on a jury ? 
i never have . 
my wife has 
but i haven't . 
i got called 
but i , uh , never , uh , got selected for a jury  , 
i sat for ten days 
and they had some guy that was , uh , defending himself . 
so uh , our discussion's about , uh , the care of the elderly ? 
you know , uh , what do you think is important ? 
if you were , 
uh , i don't know how old you are , 
but grandparents , whatever it is , uh , who were ready ,
uh , well my dad's almost ninety 
and he's in good shape . 
uh , but , uh , some friends of mine have , uh , gone through this . 
i think i'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and , uh , where they did some things to try to keep them , um , mentally alive .
well uh , uh , my wife's grandmother 
and we go there , uh , once a year . 
we tend to see her there cause we're in boston 
so we're pretty far away . 
when we visit minnesota though we go to see her . 
and it seems , uh , 
i mean the environment there , i don't know too much about it 
but it seems nice enough . 
uh , it's hard , 
at least half of the residents i would say are not mentally sound . 
so it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to retain , uh , clarity , say , uh , you know .
 well i don't know . 
we also , my wife and i , uh , uh , volunteer to go to a , uh , nursing home that's just a mile from our house . 
uh , she goes more often than i . 
we used to go once every two months to visit some of the patients there . 
and we have a two year old son 
and so sometimes we'd take him with us . 
and , uh , there i would say it's the same thing . 
uh , relatively nice environment 
but again , um , it must be depressing for the people have retained all of their , uh , mental skills and so on . 
it's , must be depressing and see all these other people who really don't know where they are . 
do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with , that the people who operate it seem to have , what you'd perceive of as genuine concern ? 
uh , some of the patients asking for things , uh , just repetitively 
and so 
i'm sure learn what's normal for this person 
and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person you know , is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need , you know . 
it's possible , 
i was thinking also that there could be a fair burn out factor 
oh , yeah . 
i'll tell you one thing though i saw that was really nice . 
we saw a husband and wife , 
we used to see a husband and wife in there , uh , together 
and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were 
but these two were . 
and when you walked into their room , they had brought all their furniture from their house 
 so it 
 and so , 
you walked in there 
and it didn't look like , uh , you know , how , you walk into some rooms 
and it's completely generic . 
there's nothing , maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person 
and that's it . 
but this room , on the other hand , you know , they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that 
and they had all their stuff from their house 
and it looked like , uh , it must have been , 
it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them 
and it must also give them a sense of , uh , uh , security s , uh , 
have read . 
i used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who , uh , were adequately deficient in their abilities , uh 
but i also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because i think they provide , um , a lot of social activities . 
 uh , one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities 
and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation . 
uh , and , 
that's new to me . 
well it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there 
and i feel like , the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like put her in there . 
and there's so much , 
uh , so uh , same situation uh , we're in . 
we're kind of past having to provide child care . 
our kids are grown up . 
we don't have any grandchildren yet . 
but , uh , uh , they're , 
how old are your children ? 
uh , one's twentysix 
and the other is , uh , twentyone . 
so uh , uh , 
well , they're going to be getting there . 
you know , there's 
oh , i see . 
but , uh , 
i have , uh , five children . 
i have a eighteen year old son . 
the rest of my girls are like twentythree , twentysix , twentyeight , and twentynine . 
and i have three granddaughters right now . 
and , uh , i , uh , 
one's in iowa . 
and , uh , she's a teacher 
and what she does is she ,
 oh , okay . 
 and so she kind of , 
and they let her bring her little daughter in for free . 
but she just works parttime . 
then i have another daughter in , uh , bountiful , utah 
and she has to work fulltime 
and it's just tearing her apart . 
she has a private babysitter . 
and , uh , the baby just screams . 
i mean , the baby is like seventeen months 
and she just screams . 
well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there . 
they're not even there yet 
it's hard . 
 uh , uh , i have a seven month old granddaughter 
and , uh , her mother stays home 
and as orange county 
they live with us 
and so , of course , we love it . because we get to see this cute little baby all the time . 
but , uh , uh , she just , 
uh , she used to work and child care 
and she says after working in there 
and , you know , here she was a provider 
but , you know , there's only so much one person can do . 
she said it's so awful . 
she said she'll never put her child in a preschool . 
i'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere . 
but really very difficult 
what did you do when your kids were growing up ? 
were you , 
well , when 
see first ten or twelve years , i stayed home . 
and , uh , then after that i went to work . 
and , uh , uh , uh , a couple of times i just , uh , uh , you know , 
then i had one job 
and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job . 
i tried to get the baby to a babysitter . 
supposed to be good , uh , recommended person from the church 
and i knew her personally . 
she had two kids of her own and everything . 
but i quit my job because i couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child . 
i mean , first of all , uh , her children were sick all the time . 
so when my son stayed over there , he got sick . 
he got sick , 
her kids had , 
right . 
 and so , uh , we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock . 
then to kindergarten . 
but s , 
that's what he got , you know . 
so it's not like he's going to infect her kids . 
and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty 
so she said well she'll keep him home 
and he'll probably just sleep anyway . 
well , you know , what 
that woman sent him to kindergarten . 
as soon as he went there , the teacher took one look at him 
and he threw up again 
and uh , they put him in the nurse's office . 
guess so , 
and then what happened is , you know , they gave her a call because they knew that she was my babysitter . 
called her 
and they said , uh , that he's sick . 
well she wasn't home . 
i mean all her kids were sick 
but she wasn't home , right . 
her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick . 
now why didn't she keep him home with her ? 
so , it got to the point where he's supposed to get out of , uh , kindergarten like about two thirty . 
and i had to leave work . 
it was five o'clock in the evening 
and i found out he was still there at school . 
and they were calling me 
and i kept thinking that like two blocks away from the school . 
i was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff . 
and he had a hundred and four fever . 
they couldn't , uh , give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything . 
i was so furious . 
i quit that job 
and i stayed home for awhile longer . 
then i went and got uh , a job in real estate where i can kind of adjust my time a little bit better . 
a little more flexibility . 
you can come and go . 
but , uh , i haven't had any really very good experience with child care .
uh , get them to come to the house . 
so , who's your favorite team ? 
my favorite team is the pittsburgh steelers . 
i used to be a big pittsburgh fan when i was little . 
well , i , uh , 
when john stallworth played he was from my hometown in alabama , 
 oh , really ? 
 so i kind of grabbed on to that team ,
that's pretty nice . 
that's good . 
i used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain , 
that's right . 
how about your favorite team ? 
well , last year it was buffalo 
and they just impressed me as being so efficient 
and they never score . 
they never blow out their opponents . 
they just score just enough points , 
 and that really impressed me . 
but then down here i li , 
  is pretty close to new orleans 
and i've been keeping up with the saints a lot . 
they are just a fun team to watch . 
they are really . 
did you see the game or , 
it was funny . 
they ha , uh , a fireworks display at halftime . 
 oh , yeah ? 
oh , you're kidding .
 so , they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter 
 oh , my gos , 
those big piece of something came falling out of the roof and landed on the field 
so there's this big fire on the field 
and they were dumping the gatorade bucket and everything . 
oh , i can't believe that . 
it was funn , 
i mean , you just really can't tell what's going to happen . 
that's hilarious . 
i know . 
it's like about two weeks ago i was watching the saints . 
and morton anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal . 
and it was beautiful , right down the middle . 
oh , boy . 
he is tough , 
he has 
he is . 
well , do you think they're going to be able to make it this year ,
i'm not sure who they play . 
right now i've got it narrowed down to the top four teams . 
who's that ? 
it's pretty much going between washington . they are undefeated . 
and one of those was to buffalo . 
and they beat the saints . 
their only time they lost . 
what do you think about , uh , houston ? 
houston . 
i saw houston play this summer in memphis . 
oh , yeah ? 
uh , from what i saw they were playing , 
when i was at the game we sat right on the front row ,
and from what i saw the game houston impressed me a lot . 
 but my brother watched it on t v and said that warren moon was just having an off night , 
and if that was an off night i'd hate to see when he's on a good night . 
oh , yeah , 
their backfield is really impressive . 
haywood jeffreys and drew hill 
they really impress me . 
well , they squeaked out a game on sunday . 
that's right . 
who did they play ? 
they played dallas . 
dallas , 
that's right , 
they won , 
all because , 
that's right . 
i remember that now . 
so that was , 
i watched that game 
and , uh , that was , uh , 
do you have a favorite between those two ? 
well , also houston is , uh , in pittsburgh's division 
 well , that's true . 
i hate to say it 
but i hate dallas .
that's okay .
well i was never really a big dallas fan 
and they just kind of grew on me . 
i imagine . 
that's the way , 
i've never been a big saints fan until the last year or two 
and they've actually started doing something . 
so , i've actually paid attention to them . 
well , do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in ? 
to tell you the truth i haven't paid too much attention to that . 
um , what cities are they looking at ? 
uh , right now i think this memphis , they're trying to get the teams . 
and that's where i was when i saw , uh , 
saint louis is trying to get a team . 
uh , baltimore is trying to get a team , 
and there's some other city . 
i'm wanting to say raleigh durham 
but i'm not sure . 
you know , i think you are right . 
i think it is raleigh . 
think so ? 
i think i remember hearing that . 
because i know they've got a   football team 
but i think it might be them . 
that would be fun . 
i'd like to see some more teams get in . 
i would , definitely . 
i think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after . 
and right now i think it's memphis and i think baltimore have a really good shot at it . 
because i know saint louis is much bigger than memphis 
and when i went up there they were saying that memphis sold more tickets than saint louis did . 
oh , really ? 
it's like the or liberty stadium in memphis holds about sixtytwo , 
i think that , uh , one , uh , advantage of having , uh , the unanimous verdict is that in a criminal case you want to make sure that you don't , uh , convict someone who , uh , really shouldn't be convicted . 
um , and i think that , you know , a unanimous verdict , uh , helps to ensure that . 
i guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way , that , uh , you , uh , would have a problem , uh , you know , that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted . 
have you ever served on a jury before ? 
oh , okay . 
it was a pretty wild experience . 
uh , what sorts of cases were they ? 
they were just , you know , small time cases where , uh , trailers and banks were involved , you know . 
they were civil . 
 oh , okay . 
what was the verdict ? 
did the jury have trouble reaching a decision ? 
uh , the jury , uh , let me see , i think it was ten to one on the jury , because they only had to have eleven people 
 so it was , 
and , uh , the one changed his vote at the end . 
so did it become ? 
so it became unanimous , you know , after they turned it in 
 and then he changed his mind after they turned it in 
 but it then became unanimous . 
you just needed a majority ? 
what was the other case ? 
that was also civil ? 
the other case was just traffic , 
and , you know , it was seat belt law 
 and it didn't even hardly 
oh , didn't really even count . 
i'm a college student 
so i haven't been , you know , a jury eligible age for very long 
 um , and , uh , i did get one summons actually at one point , 
but i declined it which i'm able to do because i'm a student , because it was , uh , a very bad time . 
well , you learn a lot going to the juries like that though . 
yeah , i mean , uh , to do at some point , um , 
but , i haven't . 
uh , i think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now , 
but i wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well . 
especially sort of . 
i wouldn't think that it does 
you know , it didn't turn out the way i planned it , i mean , the way that i would think that it would go . 
uh , you thought it turned out pretty well ? 
but you know , it was , 
jury was unorganized 
and just wasn't organized enough for me . 
i'm not used to it not being organized , 
and i just assumed that it would have been . 
oh , so it was just kind of a zoo 
and the jurors just sort of , 
someone had to figure out what was going on ? 
that's about what it was . 
um . that's interesting . 
did it work out pretty well in the end ? 
i mean , did a couple of people sort of gradually , sort of assume , uh , sort of a moderator role in the trial 
and then he finally , you know , moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have . 
so it did end up working out pretty well ? 
the one thing i sometimes wonder about , um , in civil cases is , uh , whether , especially sort of in , uh , maybe like product liability , or medical malpractice , where there's , um , sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes 
 you know , it's not just a matter um , of , you know , did this guy rip off this guy , 
and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract , 
it's sort of a matter of , um , you know , sometimes getting into very technical issues , 
and i wonder in educating the jurors about , uh , whatever , um , you know , issue is under discussion . 
to really know what's going on . 
in the case you were involved in , you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind . 
the trailer 
it was on his property . 
oh , so the deal was that he had , uh , borrowed money from the bank to buy it , 
so they came to get it . 
and then when they came to get it , well , it was on the landlord's property 
and he wouldn't let them take it off . 
uh , so they were suing to get it back . 
it was a double wide , 
so they'd already taken it apart . 
so they left it there 
 and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it . 
so they were suing him for the money , 
and , you know , there's no way they could because it was the moving company , 
uh , i get most of my news uh , from newspapers really . 
i read the daily newspaper , uh , the houston chronicle 
and sometimes i'll read like the , uh , wall street or the new york times . 
i don't subscribe to either , 
but sometimes i get a hold of copies of it . 
uh , how about you ? 
i actually get most of my news coverage off uh , computer networks . 
however , i do also watch television news , uh , usually in the morning once a day 
and i read the front page of the wall street journal 
oh that's interesting . 
you said computer networks . 
uh , uh , what sort . 
i am fairly knowledgeable of   .
 uh cause the 
uh , okay . 
that's interesting . 
and it's picked up and actually available , uh , at my office , 
so , it's , no fee , or subscription either to read at my leisure 
and it's sort of by category . 
for example 
is it , 
or is it something that is , uh , a little bit different from that ? 
well , uh , it's similar to that , 
but it's dow jones , which is , uh , the wall street journals news wire . 
uh , okay . 
so , that's interesting . 
i had access in the past to , uh , uh , the a p news wire 
and i thought a pretty good way to get news . 
uh , i've never used the dow jones news wire 
but , uh , 
it , uh , 
uh , do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader , like more long term analytical sort of approach ? 
uh , i do , uh , follow , uh , uh , uh , 
i don't know how to describe it 
so i'll say a religious newspaper which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense . 
it's a weekly 
i'd like to say however , uh , that i'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires .
in what way ? 
 uh , i think that it has to do with , uh , 
i personally think , uh , 
i have a problem with their viewpoint 
and i personally think that , uh , ther , 
well you won't offend me . 
so go ahead and say .
like a liberal type of bias . 
uh , after all , who writes . 
people who are journalist who are trained to write 
and uh , a liberal field 
and , uh , the other thing that i always notice is that whenever they write about something that i'm an expert in , i find their descriptions to be wrong 
 and it , 
they generally make mistake on anything technical at least .
that's right . 
if i am an expert in it , they usually make mistakes which makes me think i'm not expert in it . 
they're telling me lies . 
by mistakes , do you mean just like honest mistakes 
or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things ? 
uh , i think both . 
uh , by deliberate 
so , uh , uh , to give you an example , uh , we will go out of the printing media . 
i know of cases where , uh , we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but , with the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you .
huh . that's disturbing . 
 i mean he does that . 
i haven't really noticed them doing that , 
but whatever , 
again i don't watch t v news that much now . 
if i had access to c n n , i would watch t v news more . 
uh , you know , but i don't usually . 
i don't have access either . although , i did at one time 
and it was , 
i did during the gulf war 
and it was addictive . 
well , the gulf war coverage would be kind of , uh , an abnormality ? 
i just wonde , i guess . 
i would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say c n n t v news compared to the three networks . 
uh , you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever 
but i guess you wouldn't . 
you probably , 
if you just watched it during the gulf war , that probably wouldn't tell you much . 
well during that small sample , i would think that everyone was just about the same , except the three networks ,   radio television programming . 
so , if at a particular time , you wanted to get the latest and greatest news 
and you , 
how about you . 
what do you do with your budget ? 
what do i do , 
uh , at the moment it's under chaos . 
uh , right now i'm just , uh , 
i don't really have a budget per se . 
uh , it's called living within your means .
that's true . 
i don't really have a budget at the moment . 
uh , but uh , i have a rough feel for how much money i can afford to spend each month 
and then i unless the visa bill gets out of hand for one reason or another , like if i have car expenses 
and then it goes through the moon , 
that's sort of a problem . 
so uh , what do yo , 
 we're trying to , uh , 
so far we are in the clear credit wise 
but , uh , the other side of it is , 
so , not much on that side of it to add to it . 
we're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that 
so you can afford to get a house ? 
we have this dream . 
but , we don't know how long it will be a dream . 
we're real happy that we don't have any debt , 
but at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this , uh , economy right now 
so , what do you and your husband do ? 
we're missionaries actually . 
are you really ? 
and , uh , it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have , uh , like , uh , uh , support quota 
 and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here . 
no kidding . 
 and it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home . 
i see . 
overseas , where would you be going ? 
how long would you be there ? 
about four years . 
we're career 
so , we go over seas for four years 
and then we come back for a year . 
we go over four , 
we come back for a year . 
with what church ? 
uh , we're with wycliff bible translators . 
oh yes . 
 uh , i know who they are . 
in costa mesa as i recall . 
they could very well 
 well that belongs to them . 
so , uh , uh , are you , uh , active in translation ? 
uh , we will be . 
i was over four years doing language surveying which is the first step . 
you're kind of like the scout that goes ahead of the team and assesses the need . 
and , uh , came home and got married 
and we will go back as translators cause we want to raise a family 
and it is easier to raise a family as translators . 
well , i always wanted to do translation , 
but as long as i was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier . 
you know they really need surveyors cause you're free to travel anywhere . 
you don't have kids hanging around you and stuff . 
true enough . 
so , uh , uh , what languages do you speak besides english , of course ? 
well , i have a smattering of about ten different ones , 
but there's , 
i'm not bilingual in any of them because i kept switching from one area to the other , you know , 
since i did 
so i know the greetings in about ten ,
but in uh , about five i guess , i can do better in it . 
and my french is pretty good 
but it's , uh ,   french 
so , uh , i'm terrified to speak uh 
in france . 
because they're real snobby about their language 
and   french is street french 
and i just picked it up off the street 
and i knew what i was communicating , 
but i didn't know what i was saying . 
i never sat there and got a direct translation 
and said something here when i came home and french to somebody 
in   .
i don't know what i said to him 
but , uh , i didn't ask him either . 
must have been terrible . 
the , uh , 
so they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die 
and it just amazes me that the french don't recognize that . 
free style english is just , 
takes on , 
uh , some of my things , 
i'd like to have a short work week 
oh , okay . 
and we need , you know , better health insurance and you know , cau , 
we can start off there . 
if you don't want to , you know , uh , talk about it now and then 
so , so uh , i think that a short work week is real nice . 
uh , i have a thirtyseven hour work week . 
how about you ? 
well , well right now , i'm just a student . 
i only work part time , 
but i've work in the job force before 
 and forty hours is just too long . 
you just don't have any time to do anything . 
it seems like , saturday you get off , 
but sunday you're getting ready for monday . 
and have a 
and then that way everybody would have a three day holiday , okay . 
and that would make a bigger market . 
we'd have , uh , more recreation . 
people would have time to do it . 
there would be less of a stress level . 
we'd have less crime . 
we'd have to build less prisons , you know , less police force . 
it all makes sense to me . 
although , there may be more crime . i mean if people have more leisure time . 
it's not clear . 
and that , 
that's a possibility . 
can't offer health insurance 
 and it's too costly 
and what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have x amount of users in it , okay . 
so they get a specific rate . 
well what happens is that if people start and things like that , 
what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money 
it's called a group , 
well what happens then is that they cancel , because they just can't cancel an individual . 
so they have to cancel just like life insurance . 
they have to cancel everything . 
so what they do is that they cancel the insurance 
and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage . 
but , i'm satisfied with my job . 
i'm an engineering student . 
and i work for my instructor 
and i'm not a typical student . 
i'm older . 
i'm in my thirties , okay . 
and so i have a lot of job experience 
and my instructor thrives on that because he can just tell me what he wants 
and he can give me access and tell me what to do and just turn me loose 
 but really enjoyable for me because i don't have to have , you know , nobody breathing down my back 
i just really can't deal with that 
what kind of jobs have you done ? 
well , well , i do uh , research in computer science 
and i've just been doing that for a few years now 
uh , what i really like is , i like being , 
like they send me to conferences for instance , but probably not as much as i'd like 
but , uh , you know , that's just nice you know , having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of , 
uh , they also , 
a really important thing to me is when uh , they pay for continuing education . 
like , they'll cover right now 
and that's really good 
yeah , 
that's just great . 
you have what you might call knowledge power 
 you know , when you work at a company whether you know it or not , is that you're categorized . 
some people can be let go and replaced like , uh , say , uh , a typist , uh , somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist . 
but if you're a person you're vital to the company 
 and you get more benefits 
so . that's where i'm like , 
i'm into computers too 
and that's one of the things that i've found in any one of these jobs and anything i've done is that to have knowledge . 
when you have the knowledge , you're not going to , uh , you know , be let go , 
be one of the last ones to let go anyway . 
so what i , 
well , what were you saying ? 
oh , okay . 
uh , do you want to go ahead and start ? 
uh , well , i haven't really been up to date on a lot of music . 
i've been in school 
and i haven't really gone out ,
and , uh , 
well , you like classical music ? 
uh , i like classical music . 
i like rock and roll . 
i like country and western .
uh , i like all kinds .
i like different things about each one of them . 
well , i like most of them except for country music . 
 oh you don't like country ? 
i think i might like dancing to it 
but i don't like listening to it . 
the kind of country i like is kind of the older country music .
uh , that's a little bit to , uh , 
it's such 
they're trying to make it too much of a crossover thing , 
you know what i mean ? 
what's the old country music like ? 
oh , like hank williams . 
like the old hank williams . 
even hank 
the kind that 
 oh , okay . 
 uh , this stuff ,
i mean you d , 
i mean , not all the time . 
oh , okay . 
well , i guess i like the blues a lot 
and i guess you could say it's similar as far as 
 and i 
i also like jazz . 
me too . 
i guess i like 
except heavy metal 
and , uh , most rap i don't like . 
yeah . 
you're about like i am then . 
i can't ,
i used to love m t v . 
oh , okay . 
and i can barely watch anymore because , uh , they have this heavy metal stuff on there 
you know , i can't like that . 
and i liked , uh , aerosmith and 
 now i like groups like that . 
but when you get , uh , 
i even like guns and roses , some of their stuff . 
but , uh , some of these groups now like slaughter .
 oh , i really haven't listened to that .
some of them are just really rough . 
so you went to school then in , 
i'm surprised you didn't go parties or anything where they were playing a lot of music or stuff 
well , uh , i used to a long time ago 
but since i've started back into school now , i haven't really done that much . 
i've been pretty busy . uh 
 but , uh , 
i haven't . 
you know , i used to go out and dance a lot 
but i don't do that anymore either .
 oh , i see . 
are you married at all ? 
i've just been real busy with lots of other things . 
well , how old are you ? 
so , you went to school for awhile and quit . then went back . 
well , no . 
and then i worked for awhile . 
and then i started back a year and a half ago . 
changed directions . 
oh , okay . 
how old are you ? 
oh , i'm , uh , twentyeight .
i was born in sixtythree .
i guess we're 
 oh , okay .
all right . 
and , uh , i didn't really start getting into music until i went to college because , uh , my parents didn't really have music in the house . 
put it that way . 
 oh , rea , 
were they religious ? 
uh , i see . 
 so , i'm always behind . 
i'm never really up to date on all that stuff . 
but i know what i like uh , when i like a sound . a certain kind of sound , 
my parents were very musical . 
my mother had 
my father likes , uh , country western music . 
he's from , uh , west virginia . 
so that's what he grew up listening to . 
and he's always liked it 
and , you know , he's probably about fiftythree years old now , 
so he grew up like in the late fifties 
so he likes that . 
and my mom always liked that kind of stuff . 
my mom likes like , uh , doris day , you know . 
oh , really . 
she always had these old doris day records and stuff like that , though . 
 oh , well . 
so , you know , i grew up listening to that stuff . 
but , uh , uh , you know , i could see why you were kind of sheltered 
well , i do play the piano , you know .
oh , okay . 
but , uh , i like the , uh , early seventies , late sixties rock .
oh , okay . 
 and , uh , 
so do i . 
do you van halen or anything like that ? 
or how about brian adams ? 
this love cuts like a knife .
i think i've heard summer of sixtynine . 
he sings that . 
he's from canada . 
i'm not very good at remembering the , uh 
the titles and artists . 
but i can remember the song . 
do you get cable ? 
you have to get cable to get those stations anyhow . 
but , uh , yeah . 
i like to watch rock and roll videos and any kind of videos . 
i like watching that kind of thing . 
do you uh , like someone recent ? like enya ? 
have you ever head of her . 
she's not rock 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , uh , she's been on like the top ten , i guess , or whatever . 
oh , really . 
she did   , 
so how serious is the ,
well , needless to say , here in washington , d c this is the war zone . 
uh , d c around here stands for drug capital or death capital . 
uh , it's really bad here . 
uh , for example , the , uh , local high school , uh , they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns 
 and they're starting to , uh , get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school , of all things . 
well , luckily , it hasn't gotten that bad here . 
uh , san jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime . 
uh , but it's on the uprise , especially in a lot of the , uh , outlying agricultural towns .
uh , it seems to be that , uh , gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions . 
that's how uh , they bind themselves together in groups , i guess 
and , uh , 
now , the , 
interestingly enough , i don't think we have here , a lot of gangs , but , uh , only a couple , uh 
economic interests , i guess . 
and , uh , nowadays the latest thing i've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as , uh , crimes involving stealing cars is that , instead of stealing , uh , cars like at night , breaking into them or whatever , they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up , 
and then as you get out of the car , they just , uh , step up and , uh , take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house . 
well , that's efficient . 
that's the , uh , latest thing . 
that way there's no damage to the car or anything . 
they just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want . 
they're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything 
just wait for you to drive to your house , 
you get out 
and they get in  , 
off they go with your car . 
 so it's , 
uh , i think they call it car jacking around here .
i'd heard that phrase . 
that's kind of the latest thing , 
but  , every year in the d c area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides , 
so uh , it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here , 
uh , i'm from ohio 
and my wife's from florida 
 and we've just come from twenty years in the military uh , which is an entirely different environment , 
so this is a whole new thing to have to put up with 
and it's , uh , really scary sometimes . 
there aren't that many ,
and it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school 
 and , uh , of course , the mayor , uh , of d c is having a real problem , uh , trying to , 
what do you do in a major city like d c where it's a way of life for everybody . 
uh , i would hate to have to wrestle with that problem . 
i don't know what the solution is . 
uh , there's no way they can stop the drugs , 
and that's what's causing all the killing . 
well , uh , 
uh , most of them are fairly , uh , radical in terms 
uh , course and 
because , i mean , you know , the parents aren't making a living at anything . 
and they see all their friends and neighbors , uh , 
and they're accidental parents half the time anyway . 
and their friends are driving mercedes 
and , so it's actually , 
they grow up with that as their way of life 
and , uh , i think , uh , to a large extent , they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised . 
it's illegal , 
but it's not wrong because all their friends do it . 
so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes 
and they 
so , i don't know , 
it's  , 
i'm glad it's not the kind of problem i have to come up with an answer to because it's not 
wouldn't go away . 
they've always been with us . 
i mean , there's been a lot of , uh , 
and i used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus , 
but then , the 
uh , and prohibition didn't stop it and didn't do anything really 
capital punishment , uh , 
the problem i have with capital punishment is that , uh , uh , it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime , 
but i don't think that it really actually does that . 
i don't think it deters anybody , because most of the time crimes without any thought to the consequences 
they worry about it afterwards 
and then they try and get out of it . 
well , i think that in some cases , it is warranted . 
i do , too , 
and i don't , 
i think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not . 
you still have to do it . 
i mean 
so you're in favor of capital punishment , then . 
i think for serial murder 
needs to be punished or , uh , eliminated from society . 
i mean , 
and then do it all over again . 
and i don't think that rehabilitation is effective . 
have to agree with you , 
and i'm kind of in favor of capital punishment also . 
i just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because , uh , you still see them committing the same crimes , 
but , i tend to agree with you that , uh , we should have it .
i don't know that it's always effective  , 
but i guess uh , we're kind of stuck with it . 
it's a difficult , uh , problem , isn't it , to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime , uh , 
but , then , you know , i think that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment .
 and i don't think ,
because they're not really a danger to society . 
it was almost really self defense , isn't it , in a case like that . 
 but i think , 
i don't know because , 
i know they uh , put them in jail sometimes , i guess . uh , 
i think in s , 
and it ,
you know , now , i wonder what you think about this 
and , uh , unfortunately , we don't get to do it , 
but , uh , it used to be a long time ago , i guess in biblical times  , if somebody did something , for example , to your family , then you had the right to administer the punishment . 
so if somebody killed somebody in your family  , then uh , if that person was caught and found guilty , you had the right to , uh , execute that person . 
and i know that , uh , if somebody had done something to my family , i would feel that i had the right to get revenge on them 
i don't think that's done much anywhere .
that's kind of drastic punishment . 
might make you feel better 
but  , 
but , one thing , i think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation 
but , like i said , is just pathologically 
because they're a danger to everybody else . 
huh , that's interesting . 
i have to , uh 
there's a lot of folks , probably , that are in prison uh , that aren't really a danger to society , huh , 
and , uh , 
and a lot of people that are a danger 
probably more of them then the other way around .
not sure 
i'm in washington , d c or at least very close to it . 
i'm not sure what kind of , uh , capital punishment we have here . 
well , i know in north carolina , we do have capital punishment . 
and i'm from south carolina . 
well , we , in our family , have been pretty remiss in trying to , uh , you know , keep track of , uh , daily finances . 
uh , uh , way back , what , twelve years ago or something when i got my first computer , i did what everybody else does , which is to put the whole family budget on the machine and put checks , and , you know , checkbooks and all this kind of thing 
and we kept that going for about a month 
and it became so onerous that we gave up on it .
that sounds about right .
you know , so , uh , the only thing the present value of various kinds of investments and so worth . 
uh , and i only update that , oh i don't know , maybe once every quarter or so . every three months . just , basically when the statements come in .
uh , that's really about , you know , the extent uh , of the kind of , uh , financial score keeping that we're doing . 
well it's kind of difficult for me . because right now , uh , like most teachers , i'm laid off 
 so , um , i spend most , you know , 
i substitute a lot . 
so it's very hard on a nonfixed income because i don't know how many days i'm going to be called in and whether i am or not , to try to keep track of finances . 
but i know how much i have to bring in a month .
and that's about it . 
that's about as far as we go . 
and then anything extra is , you know , more or less split up between all of us .
oh , i see . 
are you married ? 
are you living with people that you're sharing expenses ? 
uh , no . 
i have three children . 
oh , i see , 
so , uh , right now , you know , aid from the state at this point because there's no other way to do it . 
and my exhusband just sort of took off and doesn't pay child support .
oh dear . 
so right now i know what i'm getting from the state 
and , uh , i have to balance , more or less , what i get from the state with my bills and , uh , you know , try to work as many days as possible .
but i still have to figure out . 
if i work too many days , then i lose all my state aid 
and if i don't work enough days then i don't get enough to meet the bills 
and it's like a juggling act every single month . 
like this week i've been just holding my breath and hoping they'll call me in 
but they probably won't because next week the kids have school vacation . 
i see . 
so , you know , the four days before , they only have a four day week 
 and they usually don't need subs because everybody's pretty good about coming in .
 a , oh , i see . 
they don't like to be absent before a vacation . 
oh , sure . 
but uh , that's why i'm doing this , to get some extra money .
my kids are in boy scouts 
so trying to get pledge sheets for the boy scouts 
because every penny i bring in is ten percent to me . 
so it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit . 
but , you know , we do a lot of robbing peter to pay paul . 
i guess we're in the situation that a lot of middleclass americans are in . 
you're the first , you know , uh , 
my next door neighbor just lost his job .
oh , my lord . 
his company i mean went , you know , bankrupt . 
actually , it was a subsidiary of an outfit called u s shoe or something . 
it was a computer subsidiary . 
i don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company . 
but , uh , you know , they just folded it up and , uh , uh , told him to , 
they took the top management and gave them jobs 
and everybody else was sent packing . 
 uh , hang on one second 
i've got 
 uh ,   somebody was knocking on my door here . 
uh , it sounds like , in a certain sense , at least at the present , 
i mean , it sounds terrible to say , 
but at the present stage , you probably are even more in the market for might be .
 do you have a computer at home 
uh , yes 
 and we try 
you know , i keep track of every penny .
every single day i'm at the computer . 
i see . 
uh , a standard spread sheet 
or i mean , 
this topic is , is russia a threat to our security ? 
to their own people at this day and time . 
 , how do you feel about it ? 
well , they do have , uh , a major internal problem .
everybody wants to defect , 
and i can understand why . 
um , i think their biggest problem is just , you know , obtaining food to live , 
so when you have the basic needs , uh , 
so , as soon as they get their own home country taken care of , then they'll consider ,
it's , uh , pretty much on the way out of the door , insofar as the strong hold that they used to have , 
and the russian people are all realizing that the communist system does not work to their satisfaction surviving in this world , 
if they can get the army ,
it's just a matter of time , because ,
and that hasn't set too well with their .
what's your synopsis ? .
well , with how they're handling their internal , uh , strife , you know , as far as diplomacy is concerned .
i think it's been a good positive direction for uh , the soviets as far as yeltsin is concerned . 
you know , he was , uh , allowed to , 
gives him more power overall , which i think is a good sign that there will be some , you know , 
politically speaking , you know , he's going to have more power , 
 , and i think it's a step in the right direction . 
i think gorbachev realizes that he's got a major uh , uh , power figure , you know , competing against him , 
and i think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't realizing , 
well , he does realize it , you know , with the fact that food and goods . 
i think that it went up a thousand percent on most , 
that's incredible 
but they had to , uh , go in the direction of a market driven economy , 
and they had to bite the bullet for that . 
so that's a good move  , on gorbachev's part in doing that . 
 but gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that ,
and i guess that's where yeltsin steps in , so far as his politics of government goes , uh , 
but i don't know how convinced the people are of him yet , myself . 
 well , that's all they got right now . 
that's their ray of hope . 
so , you know , they'll go with  ,
it's just that ,
and i think he's got between the old guard  , and the new , uh , glasnost . 
uh , i think it's kind of escalated to a point where it's out of control . 
and i think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how , in order to keep the peace on both sides . 
so i think that's you know ,  , kind of where he's stuck . 
you know what i'm saying ? 
uh , i understand . 
and that's the situation that he finds himself in , 
and you know , he's a tough guy , 
i mean , he's been through it .
so i have no doubt that he'll , 
i mean , a  , good figure for the soviet union . 
i mean , i think his intentions and his ideals are uh , well intentioned . 
and in the longterm , 
but i just think that the basic needs that the people don't have , 
i think that , uh , makes the problem most severe , and makes him um , what his ideals are ,
i agree . 
what's bad for the soviet system is that  , they have the resources to grow and produce their food , 
but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should . 
and , uh , one thing , and then all the corruption . 
i think there's the have and the havenots .
that's probably more true than ,
at least we're more blatant about it , 
but it's very secret , 
and it's been going on for years . 
i mean , you can't change things overnight . 
but if it gets to a point where people can't  , survive , i mean , there's revolution . you know , 
and that's  , 
it seems to be headed in that direction too . 
yeah  , 
big time  , 
major  , 
but you know , that's what happens when , you know , the cork blows 
and you can't handle it anymore . 
i mean , 
of changing things , too . 
probably not enough , 
but  , of what they're missing out on . 
i think they're starting to realize , 
but fax machines and cellular phones , and state of the art equipment that we are so used to . 
i don't think they even realize what's out there , and to what extent . 
i'm sure a lot of them are missing those .
the major conveniences of life .
 , normal everyday things to them is real luxury .
and of course , most of us , we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it . 
this is true . 
this is very true . 
and we , 
it's human nature though to take things for granted 
and it kind of ,
when you've lost something you know , what you have and what you don't have . 
i agree .
 so the original question , do we think they're you know , a security threat ? 
um , yes and no . 
i can go with that answer too .
the only yes i could go to is if uh , a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to a nuclear exchange , 
 but i don't even see that occurring .
um , no . 
well , i don't really feel that the soviets really want to blow up the world . 
i mean , um , we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as nonfeeling machine type people , 
and they're people just like us . 
i mean 
and they put their pants on the same way , 
and they have to eat and everything else , 
and i just don't feel that  . . . 
do you have any elderly relatives currently in an , uh , nursing home now ? 
do you ? 
i have a grandmother . 
she's a hundred and two . 
oh my gosh . 
she'll be a hundred and three in august . 
and we decide not to put her in a nursing home . 
she lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town 
and then my sister takes care of her . 
even though she is a hundred and two , she still has all of her faculties . 
she still has her snap . 
she takes care of her own business . 
this is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker , 
but with somebody that needs around the clock care , 
i have seen my family age . 
i have seen them in the , 
she's been there ten years now . 
and i have seen them age twenty 
if you had a good nursing home 
and they needed some quality care , 
i would 
my motherinlaw finally . 
they had to make a family decision . 
there's seven children in my husband's family 
and fortunately four of them live in the same home town 
and she has alzheimer's . 
it was getting where she was getting dangerous . i mean 
but they were very fortunate . 
it's a small town 
and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mothers 
oh , well that's good . 
but she really doesn't . 
nobody thought she would adjust , 
but she has adjusted beautifully . 
oh , that is great . 
but then i am also facing my father who is very sick 
and my mother and father reside in colorado . 
she's been taking care of him . 
i don't know how much longer this can last 
and at that point because he requires round the clock . 
he can't do anything without her . 
he doesn't know when to take his medicine 
and it's really sad 
and i have thought if something would happen to my mother for , uh , 
my brothers are not interested in helping me 
so i would have to move him down here . 
that way , 
i want to see the nursing home . if i have to put him into one . 
you know , where i can go see it . 
i'd be very uncomfortable with him being in colorado . 
 oh , why yeah . 
i am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around dallas . 
and some of them are limited care too where people can do , uh , 
like they have apartment styles , 
but that wouldn't work for him . 
i think he is beyond that . 
where if you need help you can get it , 
but basically people kind of have a small apartment 
and doctors are available if they need them . 
 and allows , 
well , the only problem with these are that they are very expensive . 
of course , i guess all nursing homes there is 
and the bad thing about it , before you can get any kind of government help , well you have to be a pauper . 
it takes every penny . 
they want you to spend every dime you have 
and that's the sad part about it . 
i , uh , 
and i think a lot of people who do it now . 
in colorado it's interesting . 
i talked to my mother . 
they allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home . 
and my mother could make it on that . 
what she probably would do is disburse the money to me 
and then i would send it back to her 
so that's what would happen . 
i think that's what most people do . 
you just have to give everything away . 
it's unfortunate . 
i work at a brokerage firm 
and i have seen so many people that just have to gift , you know , their belongings 
it's frightening . 
and i guess , uh , i don't know how old you are . 
i'm fortysix . 
you know , we're the generation moving into this 
and i don't know how our kids are going to take care of us .
i can't imagine . 
i'm twentynine . 
and everybody in my family has always had , 
we don't have any children . 
everybody that has , has them later in life . 
so , my mother and my father are in their late sixties . 
so , i mean , they're not 
i also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise 
and he's still living at home 
and i don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are . 
oh , i know . 
and so , it's kind of , 
you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations , 
but something will have to change as more and more of us get older . 
uh , luckily , if we could be like your grandmother , uh you know , i would love to live to a hundred and two if i were okay . 
but yeah . 
most people aren't . 
most aren't . 
that's the problem . 
and that's the bad thing . 
i would hate to have lived so long . 
she lived by herself . 
my grandfather passed away before i was born so she lived by herself up until she was ninety , ninetyone .
that's incredible . 
hello ann . 
hello chuck . 
uh , the other day , i attended a conference here at utah state university on recycling 
 and , uh , i was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the e p a and lots of different places 
 and , uh , they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste . 
uh , i didn't think that was a new revelation . 
well , it's not too new . 
so , what is the e p a recommending now ? 
oh , they really didn't propose any solutions . 
actually , the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the e p a . 
but , he had a lot of , uh , facts to give and , uh , things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down 
of news print . 
he was talking about , uh , the city of new york and how they went and collected all this news print 
 and they could sell it for a while . 
they were able to sell it for some amount per ton 
and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling , they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away . 
that's a common problem though . 
that has happened in dallas as well as new york 
and i try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house 
and after a while i just quit taking the newspaper because i couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either , i suppose . 
we're doing some here in cash valley , the community here . 
uh , we've actually got a kind of a nice set up . 
we've got a couple of plants here that actually take , uh , recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard 
and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them . because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside . 
well , that's good . 
so one of the real keys , it sounds like , to getting recycling for , uh , paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it . 
there has to be , uh , a reuse for it . 
i mean , that's why they recycle . 
the one i think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that , uh , the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers . uh , everything from , uh , waste baskets to carpet to i mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet 
 and , uh , i think they are even putting it in the roadways these days 
and they're making clothes now that are recycled . 
like the recycled plastic coke bottles and milk cartons and things like that . 
and there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from alabama 
and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government . 
one was like , environmental protection 
and the other one was , oh , i can't remember what , 
but the basic idea , it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill 
 and , uh , the solution that he came up with for plastics , it was really quite amazing , 
oh really . 
he came to the conclusion , plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's low weight , but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space 
 and there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling , 
but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it , produce electricity . 
so his solution was to burn plastic . collect it and burn it . 
well , it's carbon 
so that makes sense , 
like a carbon fuel of some sort , 
and it's more than even paper or something like that . 
there is more energy in it per pound or whatever . 
well he didn't deal with that . 
he just said burn it . 
he didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that . 
so it's not very practical  .
well it's interesting . 
i bet that was a good day , at the yeah , conference then . 
well , real interesting . 
did it change anything for you ? 
uh , i got a bit . 
so , uh , you know , my feeling is that , uh , it's really being used today , 
it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal . 
i think i've seen some statistics that say that , uh , it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life . 
because all the prison expenses , plus all the legal expenses . 
uh , and , you know , it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent . uh , for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because i honestly don't think the people that are committing the crimes that would be eligible , you know , really care . 
well , that's , 
committing them mostly is , you know , either crimes of passion or at the moment 
or they think they're not going to get caught 
i mean , it's kind of like the aids phenomenon , you know , 
i'm invulnerable , 
i don't need to care about this . 
you know , i'm 
but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis , for example , someone like , uh , jeffrey dahlmer , 
do you want , 
by putting him in prison for life , there is still a possibility that he will get out again . 
 you know , and somehow redeem himself . 
i don't think he could ever redeem himself , 
problem with capital punishment you run into is , what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent , you know ? 
there are cases where , you know , twenty , thirty years after the fact of getting evidence , especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence , then , oops , 
i'm sorry , 
guess we killed the wrong guy . 
once you've made a decision that way , it's a little difficult to go back on it . 
you can apologize nicely , 
but , you know , you know , i think , you know , the price , you know , 
the philosophy of the way our legal system works . 
oh , yeah , 
it's a , 
the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is , uh , based on the , uh , person who is accused . 
and , you know , i think that , you know , 
and the way it's being used now , it's like you listen to bush you know , 
well , where are we going to impose d , you know , 
it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in , 
tsongas is also saying , you know , make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer . 
they risk their lives every day . 
and , the profit margin's so high that , yeah 
in massachusetts , you know , 
we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something . 
so , you know , 
but you look at it's affecting it in any way . 
i think it's mainly , people , like , they get the vengeance of it . 
because , you know , 
i used to live in georgia 
but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed , it's very racially related 
oh , yeah 
it's lot of blacks . 
also a lot of young people . 
you know , a sixtytwo year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what i've seen . 
and , you know , the victims' families and things , they're always talking about , you know , uh , feeling justified or feeling , you know , like they've gotten something out of it , 
i mean , my thought has been , once the guy has been imprisoned , if he goes to jail forever or whatever , if he gets killed , it shouldn't make any difference to uh , the victim's family . 
the only thing that should really , i mean , 
obviously , if someone of mine who has close died , i'd probably feel differently , 
and that , 
and , you know , also by keeping them in prison , you do have the possibility , though , we don't currently do this , of making restitution . 
i mean , the , 
you will work your prison job 
and any money you earn will go to the victim's family . 
and , human geneo research 
 and there , more and more things like schizophrenia 
and why , does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin . 
and , you know , if you take this regularly , you'll be a sane and productive member of society 
you really get back to the question of , you know , is someone responsible for their actions . 
well , i think on some of it , you have to say someone's responsible for his actions . 
i never like the , uh , 
society made me do it . 
well , i , uh , oh , 
i did forget to ask you . 
what is your name by the way ? 
uh , i'm ann . 
oh , you're ann . 
but , uh , anyway , i , uh , 
something that's been going on because of the rodney king trial here in town 
uh , and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race . uh , 
oh , really ? 
well , the people that   
uh , the jury that's trying , uh , the officers in that case ,
and there's been a lot made in the local papers of that ,
i see . 
i can't , 
i'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one . 
they have . 
they moved it up to the county north of here . 
um , it's in ventura 
and there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously , 
and uh , that , 
well , that videotape was just horrible . 
it was everywhere . 
so you know , 
and and known of what was going on . 
oh , i agree with you 
but i can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort or , you know , uh , appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff . 
you know , um , the you know , 
i'm kind of torn on this issue . 
it's like they're saying well on the one hand he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways i think true . 
but on the other hand , are not going to convict . 
uh , you know , they're not going to do their job . which is 
or , uh , let go based on whether ,
based on fact . 
how interesting . 
so what's the prevailing thought within the community ? 
 i mean you know , what the news media is going to make of it , 
but what about the community ? 
they , well , 
i guess it depends on who you talk to . 
uh , i haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it 
but there's some snickering about it . and a lot of the usually fatalistic , uh , here we go again folks ,
oh , my goodness . 
that can't be good for los angeles either . 
i , you know , 
they have that very strong piece of physical evidence showing ,
 oh , exactly . 
unfortunately that kind of thing is not limited to a big city like los angeles . 
you're going to have it just about anywhere . 
but that's interesting . 
yeah . um  , 
what about the judge who's hearing the case ? 
is he going to be impartial ? 
is he going to ,
i don't know . you know , 
 , uh , something else along those lines . 
there was a girl out here named latausha harlins . 
i don't know if it's got as much notoriety 
but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was with , uh , the rodney king problem . 
um , a girl walked into a korean owned store 
and , uh , she had a dispute , black girl . 
with the owner of the store . 
the owner of the store popped her . 
oh , really ? 
and , oh , of course , they , 
you know , the criminal case went up 
uh , uh , practically a suspended sentence . 
i mean 
oh , my goodness . 
she gave her no time in jail , you know , all of these things 
and then , oh , with petitions trying to get the judge , 
to get that judge recalled i would think . 
that's almost when you kind of wish that there where standardized sentences . 
it would make life easier . 
it would . 
the whole world would know what you were facing . 
and then it's a matter of deciding , 
uh , before a couple of years ago , i had of nursing homes 
and it was , uh , more like a funeral home . 
i always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home . 
and , uh , then i had to do some volunteer work here in tyler , texas 
and i went to one 
and it just had a very good activities director . 
everyone was cheerful 
and now i don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore . 
but resort . 
uh , i have a sister that is in nursing school 
and she's real interested in geriatrics . 
well , that sounds good . 
so , uh , she's real interested in , uh , what ann richards has been doing . 
ann richards is really cracking down on , uh , the nursing homes 
and , you wouldn't know anything about a texas governor .
i've heard the name 
and that's about all it goes . 
ann richards is our governor in texas 
and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes . 
and , uh , my sister's real interested in that that side of nursing . 
that's one problem with the nursing home environment . 
the elderly , even out of the nursing home , are very open to abuse . 
uh , you know , they don't always have their full wits about them . 
they're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on . 
and it can be pretty sad . 
i've had a grandmother who had a stroke . 
and she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died . 
and , you know , it's the type of thing that she was living down in florida . 
my families was up in maryland 
 and the other part of her family was up in , uh , new york state . 
and , you know , it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she uh , you know , could not do very much for herself after the stroke . 
and , you know , the nursing home was the , you know , best facility to put her in .
and both my , uh , aunts and uncle work .
you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person fulltime . 
and , you know , there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home .
it's a necessary evil i think . 
it sure is . 
and some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive . because 
and , you know , even there you have to watch out for , you know , 
you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there 
and , you know , the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry 
oh , yeah . 
my grandfather passed away several years ago . 
i was much younger . 
but , uh , he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life 
and someone visited him every day . 
my grandmother did . 
but , uh , if she couldn't , someone visited him every day . 
it was in a very small town nursing home . 
and , uh , people didn't get paid much there at all . 
they didn't care about what went on . 
they would let a patient get a lot of bed sores . 
and , uh , the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people . 
and then , the nurses and doctors really didn't put forth any loving care for them . 
either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford 
an elderly person can , you know , 
it's like a newborn baby . 
you need 
and nurses get so worn down . 
and , you know , there's a number of 
the elderly are very , you know , complaining because they remember the way that things used to be .
oh , sure . 
 and they feel 
 and it , very , very hard for them to accept that . 
we just , uh , moved my grandfather into , not a nursing home but , you know , a transitional type facility . 
is it , uh , like a retirement center ? 
more of a retirement home . 
and they provide one meal a day . 
and , you know , the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him . 
but they do have , you know , group activities going on . 
how's he handling that ? 
uh , he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in florida . 
uh , you know , to move into that facility we moved him from florida up to maryland 
oh , sure . 
there wasn't anything like that , that you could do in florida ? 
uh , so , uh , what are your benefits like at your job , 
and how do you feel about them ? 
uh , pretty good , actually . 
i work for hewlett packard 
and they have , uh , a pretty good , uh , benefits package . 
in fact , they're kind of known , uh , for having good benefits . 
the pay isn't fabulous , 
although i saw a survey recently 
and over the average 
oh , that's good . 
what kind of a degree have you got ? 
i've got a bachelor's in electrical engineering 
and i'm not , like , a hugely advanced degree or any of that stuff . 
uh , anyway , our benefits are pretty good . 
we've got stock purchase program and a , 
that's pretty generous , although you have to hold the stock for two years 
but , uh , there's a four o one k plan 
uh , there's , 
how long have you been with them ? 
i've been with them for seven years . 
that's good . 
and , and a lot of the stuff , the best thing is like four years or five years , it's pretty soon , you're 
so , uh , it's not t , 
but there's several medical plans to choose from , uh , that cover pretty much everything . 
i don't get sick that often , 
so i don't pay much of it , 
the hospital 
uh , they don't cover eyes though , 
and i have contact lenses , 
so that's kind of a pain . 
but , you know , i 
 but , for all 
oh , yeah , 
so that you've got small things to gripe about . 
well , that sounds like you must feel really good about it . 
the dental plan , i pay absolutely nothing because , uh 
i guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that 
so , i guess nothing . 
it's fabulous . 
uh , the , 
what about you ? 
well , i , uh , work in washington at the naval research laboratory . 
i also have a part time job at a law firm 
and i get no benefits from them , at the part time work although , they pay better per hour 
uh , and benefits , through the government are , uh , really , 
uh , uh , they're not the greatest . 
uh , i , uh , uh , got my degree 
uh  , 
i'm , uh , a computer scientist 
 and before i got my degree , i had , uh , done paralegal work 
and , uh , at that time , i was in gravy city . 
uh , the law firms in this town are not , you know , 
for a long time were just rolling in the dough in the 
and , uh , benefits were just amazing 
 and we had everything paid for , 
and , uh , anyway , with the government , it's not , uh , quite that nice a deal . 
uh , but it's okay . 
what we have to do is , we have to pay , uh , about twenty percent of uh , uh , our costs 
and it's deducted from our check each month and that sort of thing , 
and the plans that are available to us , uh , range from kind of mediocre to really sweet 
and , uh , so plan at this point . 
uh , but , uh , it could be better , 
that's for sure , 
uh , but , you know 
it's really nice for me , anyway , to be able to work in , uh , a research atmosphere , uh , where i don't have to , uh , uh , you know , worry about , uh , academics or anything like that , 
and , so of things . 
it's , uh , 
one of the things with my company is that they've , uh , got a reputation for a lot of job security 
and , uh 
so there's , 
i , myself have moved around quite a bit within the company 
 and i haven't had to move my residence to do that . 
you know , i still live in san jose 
that's fabulous . 
you see , now that's interesting , 
because i have a cousin whose husband works for hewlett packard 
oh , yeah ? 
he lives in andover 
 and , uh , the work that he , 
he's , uh , specifically an engineer and does work with , uh , the hewlett packard machines that do , uh , uh , sonographic imagining 
 and , uh , i've been over to see his complex over there 
and it's amazing . 
it's all ecologically designed 
the set up . 
in fact , i know a guy who works at andover who i used to work with out here 
 and he moved his family back east a few years ago to take that position . 
kind of interesting . 
uh , anyhow , 
or what do you think ? 
well , that's a really hard question . 
i do know that , uh , politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths . 
uh , i 
let's example , uh , 
our friend , the president , right now , says no new taxes , 
we should and especially , if anything , be cutting taxes now because of the recession 
and at the same time , the budget he sent to congress has tax and fee increases , 
so , uh , i know the politicians , uh , aren't straightforward . 
now , in terms of economics i'm not , 
it's hard to call . 
it really is . 
see , the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little . 
on investment . 
for instance , like social security tax or soc , uh , 
i mean , that's tax 
we're paying money 
and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire , the money will be there for us . 
so that's , 
yeah , you know , 
i really think that money's history 
yes , uh , 
and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back . 
uh , someone was telling me that 
i may be wrong , 
but i believe that the cure for polio is already founded , 
and staff it with people , it's really tough to close it down 
and they just haven't yet . 
well , yeah , 
i'm not exactly sure , uh , about polio in particular . 
i know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio 
i'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio . 
well , that might be the difference . 
i don't know . 
uh , the other thing that , uh , i remember seeing on t v lately uh , had to do with , 
it's like seventyfive percent of the historical sites in america are in the home districts of very powerful people politically 
to very strong politicians . 
congressional districts 
and the poor president has to , uh , either accept or reject the whole thing . 
so , it sounds like that we'd be able to save some money by , uh 
on the other hand , uh , it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your president not to veto important things .
and whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment , there's always going to be a dispute 
so that that will help solve our problems , 
but there definitely is a problem with , 
uh , i forgot , 
there's a political term for this stuff , pork barrel or something . 
pork barrel politics . 
pork barrel politics . 
there has to be some way to do it . 
i know state governors usually have line item vetos 
and , uh , i lived in massachusetts for a while 
and , uh , when dukakis vetoed certain things , there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular . 
but massachusetts when dukakis was there , anyway , wasn't in that great shape financially . 
at least at the end . 
i mean , i don't know , 
they were very good at first , 
they were in very good financials at first 
and , uh , that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well . 
and then , of course , the bottom fell out . 
it's tough . 
i mean , there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations . 
i guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot 
or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and whatnot . 
and spare the economy . 
it definitely is . 
even not for government , even just , say , for a small business . 
uh , i know some , 
uh , well , i'm not sure how it is in georgia , 
but the crime rate really is not very high at the moment . 
for atlanta ? 
uh , it's lower than it has been in the past . 
uh , i guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off , 
and usually around the christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher . 
that's probably not true only for atlanta , but for just about anywhere . 
uh , what kind of crime problem do you usually run into ? 
well , uh , the least , of residences . 
what's more likely to occur is , uh , things of that nature . 
very few , uh , assaults , 
although on the college campuses , uh , there are , uh , cases of , you know , like people getting for , uh , getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners . 
but mostly petty things and , nothing really too big . 
well , i guess here we run into that sometime , 
but i guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins 
there are some , but not very high . 
uh , as far as tellers and things like that , it's not extremely high either . 
there were one case where , uh , this one guy , uh , was taking women from the teller and , you know , making them give him money and stuff and 
so that's kind of like a double assault there . 
uh , a strange case about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine . 
it was a free standing machine 
and they backed up into it with a truck 
oh , wow . 
now , there's a crime for you . 
but , uh , i guess most of the things that happen around here are pretty , uh , innocuous . 
although , uh , from what i hear in the news , 
saw an episode of the t v show , cops 
and , uh , and things like that , 
but it's not all that common . 
oh , okay . 
i don't know , 
crime situations here , they , 
like i say , and break ins and things like that 
and a lot of it is due to drugs .
it's not like , uh , it's someone do steal a or television or v c r or something like that 
it is for drugs , you know , because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se , you know , 
you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it 
 so you really not making a sizeable profit . 
so it's not really lucrative to take chances like that , you know , even though it does exist . 
you know , just to diverge a little bit , uh , i live in an apartment . 
right now i'm finishing out my last semester at the university of pittsburgh 
and , uh , the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in .
but , even so , to like lock the doors when they go out  , you know , and things like 
uh , it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just , you know , sit out back , take a look at when people are here and when they're not 
there's a t v and a v c r 
and , and especially , uh , since there are bedrooms upstairs 
it could still happen then . 
that's true , 
but you'd be surprised also how , much people watch you that even not , uh , participating in any type crime . 
i guess there was one case , 
i was surprised , uh , 
so happened this person worked at the same place , 
i work for georgia tech 
and they work at the same place i did , 
but i didn't know that they had been watching me 
because i was getting ready to go in my car one morning 
and the first thing they said is , uh , you must don't have to be to work at eight , you know , 
like shock , 
i , uh , get a lot of my news driving home from work listening to all things considered on national public radio . 
uh , that is one of my big sources for current events information . 
uh , i really like that coverage . 
my wife , uh , on the other hand is home most of the day 
and she watches a lot of the cable news network . 
have you , uh , ever heard of all things considered ? 
i can hear it at uh , uh , oh , the college town nearby when i'm in stillwater , which is about an hour away , 
but the f m signal doesn't reach this far . 
uh , i'll listen to shortwave quite a bit . 
it gives you a whole different perspective on the news , uh , when you hear it from , say , a european 
uh , i agree with you , too , on uh , uh , the cable channel , c n n and headline news . 
uh , i'm not too satisfied with our local newspaper 
i'm , uh , interested in the shortwave aspect of it . 
uh , how do you find that the coverage from other places in the world  , uh , compares with the american coverage of , 
how do you think that , uh , the viewpoints differ ? 
i think a lot of it is just , uh , the fact that in the u s you're so far removed , uh , in a lot of cases from , say , conflicts 
or it's not happening in your backyard 
 so than what's on shortwave . 
is almost , uh , 
they almost take all emotions out of it when they 
and it just , 
they seem to give more of just the facts than opinions . 
do you think , then , that , uh , the american media is presenting an opinion along with their facts ? 
and i think a lot of it is , uh , especially t v news , 
they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to , 
i mean , you know , i think it's important to interpret it , 
but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to do the interpreting . 
oh , i like the straight reporting . 
uh , and then i hope to be able to form my own opinion of it . 
it's nice to hear someone's interpretation of it 
 uh , i always think it's humorous uh , for thirty minutes 
and then for an hour and a half you hear different commentators explaining what you just heard . 
and a lot of time i don't hear exactly what they write into it . 
so overall , i think i would rather hear just straight reporting . 
one of the things that i found interesting last year during uh , the gulf conflict was a sentiment against , uh , peter arnett , who had stayed in iraq and was presenting , uh , some of the things that were available . 
uh , uh , uh , hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory , 
and while he was being severely , uh , censored and could not make any judgment call on this , it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda , 
but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that , you know , this isn't a baby milk factory , 
how could he say it was , uh , 
i think that , 
people have that opinion . 
and find out every , 
so , let's talk about the , uh , wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order 
and after the fact , the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it . 
what do you think ? 
is pennsylvania kind of out of line there ? 
devil's advocate possibly , 
but you are trying to avoid paying taxes 
and you're still circumventing it . 
you are legal in your circumvention of that law . 
what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though ? 
i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying , uh , income tax on something that you purchase mail order ? 
really , i don't think that's a valid argument . 
i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax . 
um , or , uh , bryn mawr stereo dealer . 
uh , but pay the sales tax  .
corporations have to , 
why should an individual just because the state can't really find out about it , be able to avoid paying sales tax ? 
well , i mean , it seems to me that , generally , at least in my own experience , when i purchase something mail order , it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania . 
it's because , i'm sorry , the commonwealth of pennsylvania . 
uh , it's because i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area . 
so i go outside the area for that . 
and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though , you know , the revenue stream went to another state . 
as a conscientious consumer . 
it's not your responsibility 
b , is it also legal ,
into place in the next few years . 
it is a lost revenue stream right now 
and states can use all the revenue they can get . 
do your arguments still apply ? 
well , i think that if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion , then i don't argue with it . 
i need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania . 
which is exactly what businesses do at the present . 
but the point is is that businesses do that . 
the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question . 
that's a cost of doing business . 
the burden 
that's my understanding of uh , the way it works . 
usually , the person ordering doesn't pay . 
but the accounting department will , uh , suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay . 
and if businesses try to avoid that . 
i ,  .
businesses , uh 
from say utah . 
um , i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax . 
my accounting department will at the end of the month . 
i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania . 
and i know they work that way uh , say here in d c . 
see i'm unfamiliar with that because i never see that end of the business . 
so , my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer . 
uh , but , if that's the case , if the business is responsible for policing themselves , then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that , uh , the opportunity to forget that you owe sales tax for something , uh , can be avoided . 
that's true . 
there is no well defined mechanism at all 
in order to gain the revenue that's being lost . 
uh , i mean , i don't know if i agree with that . 
do you , 
 so , what is your , uh , family , 
what do you usually do as far as budgeting ? 
we have a very detailed budget . because my husband is a finance major . 
and for gas and things like that . 
and then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for christmas and for , uh , other things . 
then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year 
and we budget them into what we call our needs and wants list . 
and so , uh , the things like a vacation . 
we have a vacation fund . 
we have a fund for the things we need . and then for the things that we want . 
uh , and we're continually putting into those , you know , each month how much we're going to need 
and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item . 
so we very rarely buy anything on credit . 
everything we buy is paid for . 
my husband is a finance major also .
and , uh , we kind of have the same plan . 
uh , we have one credit card 
and every month we put , uh , you know , the same amount in for retirement . 
uh , and our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby . 
so we're ,
so that's in our budget every month now . 
that's the newest addition . 
but we too do the same thing as far as , uh , 
we have a set amount 
we take , oh , one big vacation a year and then maybe , you know , three small vacations . 
so you know , an ,
 uh , we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money . uh 
if we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here . 
i see . 
and we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays , that we want to put in for , uh , the vacation . that we put in for christmas . 
like you have a separate account for that then ? 
well , a lot of that , uh , i don't know how safe it is . 
i guess , uh , we keep it all in a safe here at the house . 
oh , i see . 
 and so it's actually pulled out . 
then we keep our 
 oh , i see . 
we have a savings account for the kids' education . 
that money goes into there . 
each of our , 
we have three children . 
so they each have their own account . 
i see . 
that money is put into each month . 
does your husband deal in , uh , stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff ? 
does he invest in that and 
he does somewhat . 
uh , we have an investment plan . 
i guess he does . 
but , uh , we have really found , 
this is the first year we've done it this way . 
and we are really saving a lot of money . 
because you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to , 
so what goes into that particular thing ? 
it's vacations , christmas . 
christmas , birthdays , uh , car maintenance , dental , medical , 
we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much 
uh , and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover 
we have it , you know . 
and when we see something on sale , uh , instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it , and then when something comes up , you know , kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill . 
and we're finding that we even have more money than we thought . 
well , you know , uh , what do you do as far as , 
i take it , 
do you , uh , run the family budget as far as , uh , groceries and that sort of thing ? 
all the money . 
and what's that ? 
all the money is turned over to me . 
do you have a set amount that you spend each month 
it's very generous 
and i usually have extra . 
and so then that can go , uh , you know , either back into our checking account 
or i can just carry it over . 
uh , you know , there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months . and 
but that's completely up to me how i do that . 
i do too . 
i stay home also . 
 and so it's kind of my money 
and i also get my own money to do what i want to . go to lunches , you know , and do that kind of thing . 
we have a clothing , uh , envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing . 
it really works out great . 
we're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that . 
 and we're , 
as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a t v or a big item , like for the house . 
do you have like a household ? 
like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year . 
and also , we need a new bed . 
and so we've got both of those budgeted 
and we put a certain amount in each month 
and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those . 
and if we find one on sale before then , then we can just take that and put it towards  , 
we've got a nice little valley here 
and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in 
and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley . 
 well , here in seattle , uh , the air's getting more and more polluted . 
uh , we're in kind of a basin .
and , uh , seattle is on puget sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains . 
and , uh , there's been population growth around here .
and , uh , .
i think 
here in utah up along the wasatch   along the western side of these rocky mountains here , where a lot of the big cities are salt lake and ogden and provo 
and logan's up in the valley a little bit further north , 
we get a lot of pollution 
and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars . 
and , uh , it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion .
and when we get , 
and it just sits and sits and sits 
and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the wasatch front which match that of l a a few years ago . 
it's almost sad . 
because when i grew up here , it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys 
and now it's not in the mountain valleys . 
i live in the ,
and , uh , uh , it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution .
i think probably due to , uh , a lot of students going back and forth to school . 
and then we're right next to interstate five also . 
they're getting serious about things like , uh , mandatory , 
well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties , 
 oh , yeah . 
  have they started doing that yet ? 
not in logan up here cause we're doing a lot better . 
population is a lot lighter up here . 
we have that here 
and , uh , they're expanding it to , uh , more counties here . uh , as the population spreads out 
and i think they're also going to be making it , uh , mandatory for more cars . 
there was , uh , something in the law about if your car was over a certain age , like over twenty years old , you didn't have to get it done anymore . 
they're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun . where they're , uh , looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust . 
kind of like a radar gun . 
and  . . . 
oh , really , 
you mean they could 
do it remotely just looking at what they do , 
they do several different types of things . 
sometimes they put a source light 
and they look at the source light 
and then as the car goes by , you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it 
and you can look at the emissions actually . 
and  . . . 
now where does the source light go ? 
like across the street . 
they'll set up 
 oh , i see . 
and they're also looking at , uh , other , you know , ways of monitoring this cause they've found out something basically that , uh , 
and a poorly tuned car can emit something , 
it's an incredible amount . 
it was like four hundred times as much 
it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half . 
that's neat .
but it's also been , uh , oh , you know , 
everybody is talking about using more mass transient here 
but uh , it's tough , you know . 
like i've looked into riding the bus to work 
and i can drive to work uh , and get there in twenty to twentyfive minutes over a very congested corridor . which goes over lake washington on one of the floating bridges . 
but uh , if i take the bus , it requires several transfers 
and it takes over an hour . 
 so it 
and they're  . . . 
and you know , i feel guilty cause i'm driving a  , 
uh , uh i should say something . 
that i'm the , uh , least informed , 
this is totally accidental that i have to talk about this topic . 
but , i'm the least informed person in the whole united states . 
this has not been determined yet 
but i've never read a newspaper in my entire life 
and i never watch t v news nor listen to the news on the radio unless i'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before i can turn it off . 
any particular reason ? .
well , no . 
uh , they've tried to lock me up and , uh , things like that . 
but , uh , uh , i'm basically not interested 
and i also find and off the , uh , uh , 
what am i trying to say . uh , 
i do learn about things .
and i occasionally will read something like the new york review of books . 
you know , someone will write a book about something 
and then i'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier . 
but it , 
and somehow , 
and anything i participated in or know about when i read about it in the paper is always uh , covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that i don't have much confidence in it . 
but , i mean , i don't think it's just that i'm lazy .
i really don't , 
i like to refer to this as sort of consumer report phenomenon .
and , uh , i guess you could explain it two ways . 
and the cynical view is , well these things aren't doing a very good job at all . 
and the view that i would rather take 
 and i think the same thing is true with news . 
if you want to just have an idea as to what's going on , most papers , the times , the wall street journal , the 
if you were deeply involved in it , then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know 
doesn't want , 
i totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them . 
so , i mean , i'm not being elitist in that sense , i hope . uh , 
well , i mean , there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes .
 and most people think it is 
and i can , you know , accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it . 
by the way when you say most people think it is , 
i think it's like ninetynine point ninetynine think it is , percent . 
i don't think it's that high . 
oh , you don't ? 
i know a lot of people who may watch the t v news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper . 
that's , is a reasonable start 
and for awhile i didn't read a newspaper when i came out here because i didn't find one that i liked . 
uh , and if something important happened , it was covered on t v 
and i could then go if it were important enough to read about . 
and i imagine you get the same level of   something that you cared about happened , you'd find out from friends or other channels .
uh , i did , on for , uh , uh , the whole business of , uh , 
see i actually have a , 
clarence thomas or , 
the thomas and anita hill business . 
that's the closest thing . 
i deeply cared about that . 
uh , and i sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine 
and when i arrived at her house , she was engrossed in that . 
we ended up watching it for a couple of hours . zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and watching it some more . 
and i thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on . 
but even then , i didn't end up doing it on my own . uh , uh , 
i stayed as far away from those as i could . 
i decided i didn't want to waste the time 
i had , i guess , five years ago now , wasted that kind of time with oliver north hearings .
do you ever read , 
what sort of company do you work for ? 
uh , i work for georgia tech . 
i work for the research facility . 
uh , and it's kind of small in a sense 
but it does have , about , uh , i guess , two thousand civil employees . 
and , on a scale , i guess it's still considered small . 
it just have a lot of different laboratories . 
the area i work in , it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so . 
so that's make up most of the laboratory 
what about yourself ? 
well , i work for , uh , actually probably similar kind of place . 
i work for , uh , lincoln laboratory . 
oh , okay . 
uh , yeah . 
we actually do some work with some people down at georgia tech . 
i see . 
uh , and , uh , 
so we're actually part of m i t . 
so it's very much the same kind of place uh 
 oh , okay . 
right . uh , 
uh , while i was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to , trying to think of uh , the challenge of the work and , uh 
i don't know . 
uh , what sorts of things would you consider important ? 
 well those and probably the security aspect of it . 
because a lot of time nowadays , even though you're working , uh , you're treated , 
and it may not be true in every place . 
in a lot of cases i think you're treated more like a number instead of a person . 
because when it come down to layoff , they don't really consider people their next dollar going to come in . 
how they going to pay their bills . 
they just lay them off . 
and i was reading this book one time about this guy that had , uh , 
i think the company still exists . 
what they use to do is , they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off 
that way that , you know , one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time . 
and , uh , you know , i think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better , you know , other than you know , something like , 
unemployment is good 
but i mean the company as a whole 
because you as an employee , even the company is making money , 
they paying you a salary 
but you are responsible for that company growth . 
you're responsible also for helping that company get to the point that it's at at making profits . 
so there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than , you know , uh , neglect or something like that . 
you know . because it's not a person's fault that , you know , people not buying or businesses are not on the up and up all the time , you know . 
i don't see how one or two people , maybe more one or two , but , you know , a number of people a company situation . 
now how do you mean that ? 
i know it , 
well in a sense that say , how do you make a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people .
what about the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well . 
you know . in that standpoint . 
well , the effort equally among all the employees of the company 
i really do . 
i think it'd be better that way 
and even at that , it would at least give the person time to look for another job because 
and , you know , there are reason to look for another job 
you know . that's my views , you know . 
i've heard of a couple of companies that have done that . 
i think , uh , back about , a few years ago when things were tough , hewlettpackard did that for awhile . 
they went to a four and a half day work week rather 
and i think you can do that for a little while 
but i'm , 
well at least that would give a person a chance to look 
all right , have you lived in this area long ? 
uh , but , uh , i've noticed that , uh , this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past . 
 you know , you see a little bit more rain . 
i mean by mid february , i mean , we start getting a lot of rain . 
well i remember last year , or the year before , 
but it , 
terrible ice storm , uh , around this time of the year . 
and , uh , this year it's been so hot and , uh , sunny 
uh , quite amazing . 
my wife and i we used to live in san antonio , couple years ago , 
and it was i remember the first day of spring , 
it was so much ice that came down , later on that afternoon and evening , 
it was horrible . 
i was just talking to my son today , 
he's up in boston , 
and it was twentynine there 
and it was , you know , in the seventies out here 
he really wished he could be here , rather than there . 
well , um , i don't know 
i guess i'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather . 
oh really . 
um , i like it warmer , 
i mean you know , i like it warm 
but it doesn't really matter . 
i mean , i would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly 
but , uh , 
i have , you know , 
i , don , 
i think it's really been delightful . 
in warm weather areas 
and , uh , uh , the ice and snow just doesn't , uh , hold any allure for me at all . 
well i spent three years in germany , 
so i'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway .
but i got used to it , 
it was really strange , 
i mean , just swelter 
and then we got used to it 
and then we went up to dallas 
and it was just , 
not that it's just hot or dry , 
it's just not very comfortable , 
it just , 
do you think san antonio is more comfortable than dallas . 
you must , well , uh , 
we were down there 
and , the last day , right before we left , i had to ride with my sister 
and the air conditioning went out on the car  , 
oh , wow . 
and , you just get used to air conditioning all the time , 
oh yes . 
and this , 
it was just , 
the humidity was like eighty percent plus 
and it was just killing us . 
oh yeah , 
it's terrible . 
orlando is the only place i've ever been where i've seen the car sweat . 
i mean , that's really bad . 
well , i mean , i guess i've been in some places , you know , where the weather was just so mild , you know , places like monterey , california or ,
just , you know , so mild , 
and then you've been to such extremes like san angelo , texas where you walk outside and you sweat , 
you know you're sweating , 
you look down at your arm , 
but you see the water leaving your arm , 
it's so hot ,
oh wow , uh . 
i know i tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate . 
uh it doesn't , 
some people say , uh , they like to watch the changing of the seasons 
but , uh , i'd rather , you know , like southern california , you know , have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time . 
so , it's kind of a luxury . 
i tend to agree 
but , i don't know , 
in some respects it probably   more tolerable . 
well i guess uh , as some of the others we might have gotten . 
the other topics . 
i got one topic , 
they said talk about the middle east situ , well , 
i guess we're supposed to say goodbye or something , and think about what 
my daughter is here prodding me to say goodbye . 
we messed up the conversation , anyway . 
well i mean i've had some pretty bad , i guess some pretty controversial topics 
so it's just like well that was my fault . 
but then the weather's like , 
man , i mean , it gets pretty mundane , 
i mean you can only talk about the situation just so long . 
i know , 
weather's just not all that inspiring . 
well it's nice talking to you . 
drug testing in the work place . 
um . i've been tested a few times , just before employment . 
but that's about it . 
i've never had random drug testing . 
we have random drug testing in my business , 
but i've uh , never had to do it . 
oh , really ? 
and i think it's mostly for the field people that , you know , drive trucks and heavy machinery , that kind of stuff . 
but , uh , uh , drinking beer and stuff at lunch time , 
at least that's . 
 oh , they do with alcohol . 
oh , i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine . 
the whole thing . 
huh . that's interesting . 
it's a , 
what type of field of work are you in ? 
i'm in the oil business . 
oh , in the oil business . 
and you work in the office around . 
so , uh , it's pretty safe environment . 
see , i work in the automotive air bag industry , where we make the safety bags 
and we work around a lot of explosives . 
 well , that sounds like kind of an important job to be , uh , straight on . 
so that's , you know , 
i'm all for it , because well , the type of environment i work in , you know , they're working with explosives , 
and so they could blow up the whole , 
well , they have safety features with each of the explosives they use , 
but still , it can be dangerous . 
well , i agree . 
i think that , uh , you know , under certain circumstances , especially when you're working that you need to have that kind of stuff . 
you know , 
if it's , 
as long as it's not abused , uh , you know , random , you know , 
as long as it's random , uh , are protected , i don't have that big a problem with it . 
well , see , this is it , 
this is where i start having my problems with my company . 
i work for a private company , 
but if they catch you , if you test positive for a controlled substance , then you get fired . 
oh , wow . 
so , you know , it's sort of one of these little catch twentytwos . 
huh , that's . 
i think our policy is that , 
all right , it's probably the same thing . 
i'm not really sure what the  , 
it's one of those things that you read once , 
and then , if you're not worried about it , you just forget about it .
that's right . 
but i know , they do have counseling , and that they do give you a second chance , 
but i'm not sure if 
our company's a little tougher on the second chance . 
i mean , get back at your job . 
but , uh , when you're a private company , the rules don't always apply . 
uh , do you think it limits , 
well , to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment 
and , you know , it's not , 
i guess i that's been a problem . 
uh , so uh , well , shoot , like any lottery , 
i mean , everybody's got an equal chance to get picked . 
so , uh , i'd rather have that than , you know , say well , this week the a s and b s are going to be in 
and next week ,
you could time it just right . 
i know one employee , 
i know , when i was working with , he had alcohol on his breath , 
and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not . 
that'd be just as dangerous . 
well , especially around , uh , you know , equipment , machinery and stuff . 
huh . that's true . 
you know , had a beer at lunch time , but not to excess in any case .
do they give any limits on alcohol , 
or is it ? 
uh , i don't remember , to tell you the truth . 
i don't think they do . 
um , well , they must , 
that just shows you how much i've been paying attention , 
because i really don't know . 
i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask .
well , you know , you can take some of that testing a little bit too far . 
uh , there was a company in houston 
they did , uh , an unannounced drug sweep of their company 
 oh , of , 
it was not only drugs , 
you're first . 
i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement . you know , not to get like in a dead end job . 
and plus , for me , it's , uh , i mean like medical and you know , uh , benefits and dental . 
they're also important . 
i guess one of the differences i see is , uh , working for a university , uh , there is room for advancement , but not so much so , in , uh , quite a highly unionized environment 
so there is a progressive path , 
but not being in say the commercial sector , the motivation isn't there for a lot of people 
are they like pretty much train for a specific job 
but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have , uh , a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances . 
uh , so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution , 
uh , it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance 
 and i suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution , perhaps somewhat even with the business , uh . 
but i agree , you know , the , uh , medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the , uh , security aspect for long term employment , uh , 
well , you know that's interesting though . 
because i don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore . 
i use to think that , you know , after you work , 
you mean job security ? 
uh , that use to be i think a couple of years ago , 
but i don't know if it is so much anymore . 
in fact , we just had a lay off in what november , i guess . 
but , uh , it wasn't necessarily , 
i mean , you know , some people had been there a long time . 
we are seeing that here as well . 
like in some of the large oil companies . there has been massive lay offs . 
uh , so it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world 
no doubt 
yeah , 
and institutionally , like here at the university , oh if there is a cut back , well gee , it's not where it's needed , 
it's where it's most expedient which ,
expedient , 
that's exactly it . 
where you know it cuts back the most . 
see , yeah . 
so we , 
i think that's one of the things too . 
you get too many management people , you know . 
it's very easy . 
and it's very easy for them to say , oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know . 
and then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time . 
well , those people aren't there anymore . 
because it's support people that are providing 
so what else do you think is important ? 
well the , uh , 
that's maybe the majority of the importance , i guess . 
because my perspective is from an institution , 
uh , there is not much incentive for innovativeness 
 but if you're in the corporate world , i think there is considerable motivation for i guess innovation , 
although you know , the more complex your structure the , uh , less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through 
 but , uh , i think uh , things can happen much more quickly 
and so you can see the reward of the efforts . 
i think probably in a small , 
i was going to say it's more personal for one thing . 
you probably have a better team , uh , cooperation , or team playing , atmosphere . 
probably , where as in a bigger corporation , i think you're just a number , you know . 
you end up being your own person 
 and , uh , if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up , well then that's their problem 
whereas yeah in a smaller , 
i think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished , you know . 
it becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves . 
so , uh , with the issue of trial by jury , uh , i actually found the whole question about whether you need a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting . 
actually , i agree that that's an interesting thing . 
but for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law ? 
i don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because i thought there were cases uh , i don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors , but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve . 
i actually thought i'd read that , too 
and that's why i phrased it that way . 
i wonder , 
things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote , 
and things that are under state jurisdiction , even criminal don't require , 
but i don't know what the laws , 
do you think that that's an unreasonable , uh , requirement that they be unanimous ? 
well , i'd be curious as to what the , uh , requirement for an acquittal is . 
and i don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if , you know , six or seven voted not guilty , then instead of it being a hung jury , that was an acquittal . 
but i don't know whether you need a unanimous , uh , vote of not guilty to acquit . 
that would be an interesting change . 
it was also allow the , uh , idea that if you had one person who was , uh , very disagreeable that , i mean , the likelihood of getting the proper judgment . 
so , i think , if anything , it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision . 
i'd agree with that . 
but i've never had the opportunity to serve on a jury , although i've been out here and registered for , i guess , about five years . 
i would like to do that . 
i've been out here twenty some years 
and i've been called , uh , three different times , 
but i've never actually even made it into the jury box .
and i've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions . 
uh , i , 
i also think that would be really good . 
well , the people i know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that , you know , after initially finding out where people stand , that the whole deliberation usually results , if there is and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right 
 and in fact , i'm not sure that that's any more , uh , liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than anything else . 
 well , that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure 
and that , uh , peer pressure , 
and in some cases if it's a long trial , the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time , that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons . 
some of them did say that , you know , when they were the only one left opposing the verdict , uh , you know , everyone was getting on them so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict . 
i understand . 
you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude , uh , to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response . 
i think of the movie , uh , twelve angry men . 
you ever seen that movie ? 
uh ,  , yeah , 
it's exactly that situation where , uh , 
it's henry fonda 
and it's eleven to one 
and he's the one , 
i believe he was opposed to the conviction 
uh , and he held on 
so , do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have ? 
uh , actually no , 
i kind of miss out on most of the current events . 
i just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it . 
do you watch a lot of t v to get the news then ? 
but that's the on , 
basically that's my only major source of information . 
what about you ? 
well , i read , uh , 
i get a bunch of different things . 
i get a newspaper every day 
and i try to at least have a few minutes to look through that 
and i look through , uh , 
i get a newsweek every week which i pretty much read that cover to cover 
and i , as far as , you know , 
that satisfies most of the short term news i get . 
uh , don't watch much t v , 
don't have enough time 
and , uh , don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that , you know , 
they might give you a little blurbs like 
and that's about all i ever hear of it . 
uh , but most of my news probably comes from newsweek 
and for the longer term and , uh , readers' digest and some of those other types of magazines that come out which , they , 
the news isn't , like , immediate what you'd generally think of as news , 
but it's recent material . 
and it's more in depth . 
it is more in depth , less broad . 
well , actually , it's , probably isn't less broad , 
but it's just more in depth 
and , uh , it is more just significant information , you know . 
it is the big events , not the little events . 
not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of broad and main , you know . 
i know , 
where they're just trying to fill in . 
or they're making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news . 
uh , i get kind of bored watching t v actually , when i watch the news on t v because 
i know , 
i do , too . 
and , then there's nothing that , you know , really is like oh , so exciting . 
you may find one little , uh , news item interesting 
so you have to wait twenty minutes to hear about it . 
that's about what it ends up being . 
listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something .
actually , you mention newsweek , 
i do like , uh , u s news and world report . 
i don't get to read it as much as i like , 
but i think that's a good magazine . 
i think they're about the same . 
they certainly have a very similar , uh , charter at least in my mind . 
and , uh , uh , uh , what kind of news normally interests you , 
i mean what do you find interesting 
that's going to affect our , uh , economy quite a bit . 
i think it will , 
uh , they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence , 
but we've yet to see it 
and th , 
it's real short term yet , though , 
i mean , it's only been , three months or something like that 
oh , yeah . 
but they like to tell us that it's going to be important .
i'm pretty sure it is , because , uh 
i think it is , too . 
i think that's a possibility , 
uh , it will be easier to do business over there , too . 
for the companies that already have a presence over there 
and , uh , i know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninetytwo so that they would have it when it 
oh , yeah 
so they have a toe hold , 
because once you're in there , then you can easily expand . 
but getting in after nineteen ninetytwo is more difficult . 
because , when they first start off , they're going to be highly protectionist 
and there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist , 
even amongst themselves , they're being somewhat protectionist , you know . 
like , england doesn't want to do one thing 
and sweden doesn't want to do other thing 
and they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet . 
and some of it , i mean , is , 
i'm sure within those people's minds , it's quite justified . 
i can understand their viewpoint , 
they're starting off , 
their economy's a little bit weak , 
so you want to 
before they 
uh , what is the , uh , 
do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that ? 
actually i'm not really into sports . 
my roommates are , 
so , unfortunately , i forced to watch quite a bit of sports . 
against your will . 
we have to , fight over the remote control . 
at least you guys have a remote control . 
it's sometimes better to not have one of those . 
course , you can always mislocate it . 
so , what kind of music you into ? 
well , i have a , uh , pretty wide taste , uh , in music , ranging from progressive rock to jazz to , uh , lot of different forms of , uh , music . 
in fact , it's easier for me to say , uh , the types of music that i don't like are opera and , uh , screaming heavy metal . 
the opera , yeah , it's right on track . 
i like classical , 
but i can't deal with opera at all . 
and heavy metal , uh , it's noisy . 
i'm into , uh , some industrial music that's , a bit even harder than that . 
but it's got to have a point to it . 
oh , i don't mind music that's difficult to listen to , 
but , uh , which seems to be music to annoy you ,
what kind of progressive stuff ? 
uh , lot of stuff that actually has , uh , ended up becoming popular like , uh , nirvana and , uh , oh , you know , 
i'm thirty , 
so lot of the stuff i was listening to in my teens like the clash and the sex pistols and 
uh , r e m makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being , uh , you know , ultra mainstream at this point , 
and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed . 
oh , yeah . 
it's , a lot of people like , saying that , you know , bands in that position , you know , sold out . 
i think that's pretty much , you know , bull . 
because r e m really hasn't changed . 
if , it's interesting . 
they're producing , uh , similar music 
and it's good music 
 but , you know , people have picked up on it . 
that's good . 
i think it is . 
i'm impressed . 
uh , for a while there , popular music seemed to have , uh , not a lot of point to it . 
i was really tired of , uh , the michael bolton . 
michael bolton really got on my nerves because he , 
oh , yeah . 
and i could , uh , go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money . 
 uh , but he picked the right songs 
i guess . 
that , and a marvelous hairdo . 
oh , yeah . 
i'm sure that sold a lot for him . 
that's all you really need for a lot of pop . 
for pop . 
it just seems like there's no real point . 
you hear the same tune over and over again 
well , you were saying that you liked classical music 
 and i like a lot of classical music , 
but i also dislike , uh , some classical music , 
and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music ,
i can believe that . 
what kind of things do you like in classical ? 
what's the 
stuff that i like , 
uh , i like bach . 
i tolerate vivaldi . 
i can't ,
uh , uh , i like tchaikovsky . 
he can make a lot of noise when he's , uh , so inclined . 
oh , yes . 
uh , and some stuff that i like , uh , 
for instance , frank zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition 
 and that's interesting music , 
but it would not get performed by any , uh , municipally funded , uh , philharmonic ,
you know , we're , 
that's right , you know , 
we'll do the ninth 
and everyone will know it and 
it's safe . 
and it just isn't chance taking enough for me . 
uh , i feel a hundred times , 
do you think that there's any way that , uh , 
or do you think there's too much crime now ? 
i mean , i guess ,
uh , yeah , 
uh , well , uh , out of control , i don't know . 
i guess it could be worse . 
uh , we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood . 
uh , i live in the university district in seattle near the university of washington . 
uh , uh , there's a lot of problems . 
i mean , there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people 
and , uh , you know , we get uh , gone through , rifled through and stuff . 
okay , i would not have guessed that in seattle . 
you know . 
uh , it's not newark , 
but , uh , yeah 
what really is the answer . 
i mean , it seems like the prison systems , we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system . 
i think most people regard it as a warehouse .
we only have but so much room 
and we try to put aside in the warehouse , 
and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and 
that's what i hear . 
so it's , uh , 
i think , you know , 
don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea ? 
i'm not convinced that i have . 
uh , see , i mean , my mom taught english as a second language 
were in on drug crimes 
and , uh , 
oh , you mean she taught in a prison ? 
i see . 
and , the problem she had was not with the inmates at all . 
the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison . 
i mean , 
the bureaucracy . 
they put her , i mean , 
obviously i didn't see the classroom , uh , and , hopefully never will , 
but , uh 
there were no other classes going on at the time 
and they refused to let her wear a body alarm . 
i don't know exactly what that is , 
but i just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and really annoy a lot of people . 
but , uh , you know   , 
so she didn't feel safe . 
she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates , 
and then later on uh , the administration kept getting worse , 
and , uh , she got a couple of inmates that she didn't feel quite as comfortable around . 
but , well , when we came back to the states , she decided that it was too , 
she didn't feel that public schools were safe , 
so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison . 
but , uh , 
well , at least it's maximum security , right .
was , that it , you know , 
you said that perhaps , uh , people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible 
that run the system have given up on it . 
uh , well , yeah , that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical , you know . 
i mean , i talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff 
and it's , uh , 
you can get pretty hardened , i'm sure . 
but getting , i mean , well , see , 
i always have problems or a liberal 
but i keep , 
those are funny labels , see .
i mean , i can't help but wonder if i grew up without a father , on the streets , and 
oh , yeah . 
uh , yeah , i think you can blame it on social problems . 
i mean , i don't know . 
i mean , been more crime . 
we've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't 
there's not enough 
and , yep , 
it's a mess . 
the gentleman's name , 
but is a rhodes scholar 
and what he , 
is he the guy wants to , like , deregulate heroin , or something ? 
well , what he wants to do is take all the money that , uh , he gets for drug enforcement and use it for , uh , drug education . 
and basically , just attack the problem at the demand side . 
stop trying to attack supply which to some extent makes sense and to some extent doesn't . 
i mean , switzerland tried the grand experiment 
and , you know , they had this park where they were letting anybody use drugs as long as they stayed in the park 
jonathan , uh , you say it's near and dear to your heart . 
buying a car is , uh , something you're contemplating , i take it . 
can't do it right now . 
our situation is that we're a two car family 
 and i have a mini van we bought a few years ago . 
it's got a , uh , five year loan , 
so that's still got a couple years to run 
 and the car i get to drive is a , uh , nissan sentra that's going to be ten years old next month 
uh , what kind of a car do you think you'll buy next ? 
well a forty year old man's car , uh , something real sporty 
something a little seating room . 
how about you ? 
well , i think the next car we get will probably be a  , well 
i like buicks . 
we have a buick century now , 
it's a nineteen eightyseven 
 and , uh , whatever i get , i want to have , uh , air bags , uh , both driver's and passenger side and four door because it's much more convenient if you're carrying anybody you know , rather than have them stoop down to get over , 
and , other than that , uh , you know , reasonable cost and safety and , uh , as much economy as you can get out of a car . 
uh , you know , i'm not looking for one with a great big engine , uh 
something that will carry it around careful , i guess is best way to describe it . 
right now , we've got a v six 
and that seems to be just fine . 
i know they're coming out with some v eight now 
and i think that's probably a little over kill for this day and age . 
i was surprised to hear that the v eights are coming back , 
so , they've got some pretty powerful sixes . 
and , uh , you know , v eights seem to be a return to the days of , you know , ten or twelve miles a gallon . 
a ford truck . 
i like trucks because they're spacious , 
and it's handy to haul things . 
uh , it's not related to my business , 
i just really use it , basically , for transportation , 
but there's so many occasions when i've had to move some members of the family or do this or that , 
is , uh , traction much of an issue for you up there . 
it's a two wheel drive truck 
and i figure if it's so bad that i need a four wheel drive , i probably ought to be home anyway .
actually , uh , pretty good way of looking at it , 
uh , we had a small accident with our mini van 
a case where there was a , sort of freak ice storm 
and we weren't aware of it , and just slipped on some black ice and went into another car , 
and , this is a rear wheel drive model . 
so , we got some monster studded snow tires after that . 
haven't had any problems since . 
what make is the mini van ? 
it's a mazda . 
mazda , 
i see . 
and , uh , we're pleased with it in terms of comfort , and , uh , driveability . 
fuel economy isn't great , being a mini van , 
but , uh it's real nice for carrying around our kids and others 
so we've been able to do some real creative , uh , load hauling when called upon . 
one of my sons has a plymouth , uh , van 
 and , uh , they have a child that's five years old 
and it's really handy for hauling him around and their stuff , 
and , of course , as he gets friends , i'm sure that will be even handier . 
so , i know we're in our fifties now , but , if we had kids still at home , we'd certainly have to seriously consider a van just for their functional value . 
i think that we're going to be , uh , owning a mini van for some years to come . 
probably till the kids are out of , uh , high school anyway . 
what about , uh , all wheel drive ? 
is that something that you'd be interested in 
or is that , 
uh i'd be satisfied with a good front wheel drive car when it comes time to replace the sentra . 
and even it's done pretty well 
uh , again , like you , if conditions are that bad , i probably don't want to be driving anyway . 
so i know i'd be happy with a reasonable , uh , four door . 
you know , again , we've got the same issue with getting kids into the , 
what kind of crime do you think , uh , is the most prevalent in our society ? 
oh , boy , probably , uh , robberies , people stealing from each other . 
such as new york city  ? 
uh , that's mostly what i hear , though , is people getting ripped off and things getting stolen . 
that's the most prevalent crime . uh , far as insurance money and stuff like that , insurance costs . 
you know , everybody has to pay for it indirectly eventually . 
uh , if drug use is a more prevalent crime , though , because , i mean , so many people use it , 
and even though just using is not really , 
i mean it is a crime , 
oh , well , yeah , 
that is a crime . 
i guess , uh , when you count all the little things that people do like , 
uh , speeding is a crime .
well , that's true . 
i break that law every day .
but of felonies versus misdemeanors 
well , actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor , 
but , uh , what kind , 
uh , have you been the subject of such a crime , such as stealing , or anything ? 
well , uh , i've been caught with marijuana before , 
so i guess that was a crime . 
i got a year's probation for that , 
but , uh , 
that's not that much . 
i mean 
it wasn't that 
uh , when i think of crime , i think of stuff that affects other people like people getting , you know , killed or raped . 
i think rape is one of the worst crimes .
i think it is . 
in some ways , it's almost worse than murder . 
it's very degrading 
is hard on the people that were related to 
 you know , i mean , it is a rather final solution , though .
once a person's , you know , gone , then it's , 
but the person that's been raped has to live with that the rest of their life , you know . 
or , uh , murder 
it's a pretty good thing . 
i agree with that . 
they have that down here in florida still . 
the electric chair 
and , uh , 
i think virginia does , too , up here . 
oh , do they ? 
i think that's still an appropriate penalty to pay if they absolutely sure they got the right guy 
and , i guess usually they're always sure they got the right guy , 
but , uh , 
i think the appeal process takes too long . 
so do i . 
from conviction to execution should take no longer than a year . 
if that . 
you know , the sooner , 
a year's plenty of time 
then , you know , there's been guys in jail for six years 
and the other guy admits that he did it 
and they  , 
well , yeah , 
i mean , the system isn't perfect , 
i mean , it's run by a bunch of imperfect humans . 
you do the best you can to make it perfect , you know , 
you go out of your way to try real hard to make it perfect . 
but , i think you have to accept some of the errors . 
i think that murder itself would decrease significantly if there was a credible punishment , uh , for murderers . 
um , yeah , 
i don't know if it would or not though . 
and family members , 
you know what i mean ? 
and society probably , too . 
i mean , just general society to , 
it kind of gets 
it does 
and it decreases the prison population .
i know that 
i mean ,
and they're 
i don't think you'll ever stop all that stuff dead , 
but , you might be able to , uh , stop people , you know , 
they're thinking about it , 
they know they're going to get the chair if they get caught . 
generally the crimes of passion and things like that , uh , are not premeditated . 
i mean , they can be , 
but usually they aren't . 
they're spur of the moment 
that's right . 
 and , uh , the premeditated murders , the ones where the person plots and plans , when you catch you end up with someone who's more dangerous to society 
they could probably do it again . 
they would have no problems doing it again . 
that's right , 
they didn't have any time doing it the first time . 
and i think locking them up for , you know , fifty years doesn't do any good because 
it do , 
do you all have a budget ? 
well , uh , yeah , 
um , we've been married for twentythree years 
 and we have , uh , three teenage daughters 
and , you know , they're very expensive . 
so , uh , uh , yeah , we have somewhat of , uh , a system . 
uh , uh , you know , it's kind of hard to explain . 
we've actually gone , uh , just recently , to you know having two checking accounts . 
we always had just one . 
and now we are having two . 
uh , it's kind of hard to talk about this because to me it's very personal . 
it's , uh , 
 so , i have to be . 
that's kind of the way i feel about it . 
i usually , uh , 
my wife handles a lot of the day to day finances 
and of course , we're like a lot of people . 
we just scramble through month to month , you know . 
and , uh , 
uh , we have a two income 
she also works 
she enjoys it 
and she's good at it . 
uh , if it's , 
uh , uh , i'm pretty bad about procrastinating 
 and one of these days i am going to do something about that i believe .
but , uh , uh , she handles it pretty well . 
so your wife , 
to finance or accounting ? 
uh , sort of on a peripheral . 
 and so uh , she works for an insurance company . 
but she enjoys it . 
she likes keeping track of all that stuff 
and , uh , 
so that's sort of related to her field a little bit . 
and with , uh , budgets , you know from time to time , uh , 
but , if , you know , 
you have to keep up with them . 
so a lot of times , we uh , just kind of play it by ear . 
we try to keep uh , our retirement and our savings kind of automated 
 so we never see that money . 
just like taken directly . 
it's just taking it out , right . 
yeah . 
we do the same thing . 
 and that's kind of handy . 
because if you don't see it , you don't miss it   .
you don't spend it . 
you have something to take it out . 
that's exactly what we've always done 
 and uh , they've always had , uh , where they match your funds , you know , 
uh , you know , we've done that too . 
but , my husband works for an insurance company 
 and he has now for about , oh gosh , how long has it been , ten years i guess . 
but he was with another company before that , 
but we have , 
i work also , 
but i only have a part time job 
 and i get paid very little 
but , uh , you know , i try to use that money for food 
jim gives me a certain amount money . 
you know , we just transfer it 
and then i use that for food , household expenses , 
and then i add my own check to that 
and then with that i try and handle , you know , some of the clothes that the girls need 
but the expenses that we need and have around the house . 
just kind of 
 well jim has a budget . 
i mean he works it out every month 
uh , you know . i am given so much money a month , 
so i am suppose to kind of get the food out of that . 
so , i try not to , you know , 
you know , i don't ask for more . 
i mean i just try and make it on that . 
because i think when you go to the grocery store , you can go crazy 
 and , uh , you can really waste a lot of money that way . 
so , uh , well how long have you been married ? 
uh , about five years . 
oh , yeah . 
so you're just really getting started .
so do you have a family too ? 
oh yeah . 
so , uh , she's not , uh , 
she hasn't effected your budget yet really . 
not really . 
not too bad . uh . 
not like she will later on . 
you will see that 
what can we do here 
and then you have to really sit down and plan some more 
uh , but i think when we were back at your age , we didn't have much of a budget 
 and then as the girls got older , i think we did more and more of that . 
you know , more budgeting as they got older . 
uh , uh , but what do you do ? 
do you , 
i'm an electronic technician . 
oh , okay . 
i work for a university . uh , georgia tech , uh , research 
well good . 
 and , uh , 
 so i just , uh , 
 well , you know , we have a good friend that's about to move to atlanta . 
oh , well .
but , uh , budgeting . 
i found , you know , i feel a lot better . 
you know , we use to work out of one check book 
 and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have any idea how much money i was spending in one month . 
now , i know exactly what i'm spending 
and it's so much easier , 
 uh , well , having 
sort of the reason we're going through the school system 
graduating from college . 
uh , i didn't really perceive much of a problem with the school system . 
however , when you compare it to school systems like they have in japan and ad , 
you can compare just about thing to japan 
 and we look like we don't have anything . 
uh , it seems to be not difficult enough for students . not challenging enough . and just not generally competitive enough . 
uh , however , system works at a pretty good pace . 
i don't know . 
uh , i haven't , 
it's been , uh , well seventynine since i was at school . 
and , uh , i've seen things change . 
i don't know if i've seen things change enough that i can actually , 
because i wasn't really like listening to the world go by back then 
so it's hard to compare . 
you know what i mean ? 
but , uh , it seems like when i lived in chicago , 
i've lived down here . 
i hear the dropout rates from the schools , 
and i certainly see how much i pay in real estate taxes every year . 
and i begin to wonder if i'm really getting my money's worth . 
i mean , so many different bad reports coming out of the school system 
and i recognize that there are good schools out there . 
i mean , somebody's 
but , uh , seem to have such a high dropout rate in the big cities . 
uh , well , i don't pretend to understand that either . 
uh , but i'm not quite sure that it's the kind of thing that ought to be blamed on the schools . 
but then , again , i'm not quite sure where the blame ought to be put . uh , because the dropout rate is , in those areas , w , 
it's high in those areas where also there's poverty and crime . 
and they all seem to go together . 
and it seems like if you could eliminate one that things ought to get better . 
so , uh , a , 
they're all three social issues and could be addressed by the government in any ways . nd clearly , to me , is a kind of government thing to fix 
but it's just like , which part is best to fix just like i don't know . 
it's a complicated issue . 
i still don't think i would blame it directly on the school . 
i don't know if i blame it on the school . 
i think i blame it on a couple of different things . 
i think i blame it on the school system . uh , 
 well , that's i meant when i said the school . 
i don't blame it on the teachers in the school . 
although i think that , 
i do know for a fact that some of the teachers that i know personally get paid an awful lot more than , 
well , that's odd because i don't think the teachers in my school district , uh , were well paid . 
not all school districts are well paid . 
but there are some school districts out there that are very well paid . 
i mean i know one family that's got , 
they're both teachers , 
and they both have ,
they both work all summer fulltime . 
and from their teaching job alone , they pull in forty grand each . 
well , it , 
i mean that family is making over a hundred grand . 
and i'm , 
i mean , okay , 
i agree that teaching our kids is important . 
however , these people who only work eight hours day at it , from seven to three , 
and they only work nine months a year 
and they get an awful lot of breaks in between 
and that's my tax dollars that i'm spending on that . 
and i don't even have kids .
well that's true . 
but there's , 
my tax dollars are paying for this . 
this is wrong . 
but , when you're w , 
and there's really not much you can directly do about that . 
i think that could be improved . 
uh , w , 
you have other professional jobs 
and this is a profession . 
and , as a matter of fact , it's a pretty big influence on  , 
so , do your privacy being invaded at any time ? 
 well , uh , one of the things on the , uh , credit card bill . 
 well , yo , 
 and , in fact , uh , it is actually prohibited 
but it doesn't stop uh , from doing it . 
and it's one of the things that it's used for , primarily , is for demographic , uh , research . 
and to get your phone number on , uh , uh , lists for phone solicitations . 
now you can still , yeah , 
i've always done that . 
i started , 
once i found out that that's really not necessary or legal then i just refuse 
you going to say you don't want to sell me this product then 
i'll just buy it somewhere else or not buy it at all . 
you don't have to put it down .
but , uh , really it's part of this compliance thing . 
uh , the thing i don't like , 
i know that certain states actually sell uh , their lists like , uh , motor vehicles . 
that really burns me because , hey , you're required . 
you have to do that . 
and nowhere does it asks you whether you have permission or not to sell your name or information regarding that to anyone . 
and i think that , to , uh , voluntarily give it because someone asks . 
you can always refuse 
but it's another thing where it's required by law 
and then they go ahead and take that information and sell it to somebody .
 uh , that , 
i don't think they have the right to do that . 
i agree with you there . 
that's something that , uh , people have seen . 
oh , here's an easy way to make some money . 
but , uh , i don't know if that's been challenged in the courts or not . 
in my state . 
uh , the budget problems up here are pretty tense . 
and people are looking for alternate ways of , uh , 
enhancing revenue is the , uh , phrase they use . 
and they were talking about selling the d m v lists 
and there was uh , a lot of , uh , consternation about that 
and the last i heard they'd backed down from that idea . 
but it really makes you wonder what other lists you're own that have been made , uh , public that you ,
well , that's easy . 
whenever you donate money to someone ? 
you become , put on something like a sucker list 
and you start getting millions of calls or 
and then y , 
it kind of makes you feel   from doing it again . 
like , uh , national public radio or any of the public , uh , stations , you know . 
uh , to public , uh , t v . 
and i started getting calls from all sorts of diseases and syndromes and 
it's like  , 
and it just started soon after i had done that one . 
uh , and that's also happened to me where i've given money to my old alma mater in college . 
and , uh , it's one thing , 
they don't sell the list . 
but the thing that makes me mad is , uh , then they start getting , uh , other people , 
the people do these phonathons 
 and they call you up 
and they actually happen to be people who graduated in your class or something like that . 
you , uh , had , uh , contributed x amount last year . 
can you do better this year ? 
and , you know , like hold on here . 
how do you know that ? 
why you even telling me this ? 
is it any of your business ? 
i mean , it's one thing that i , and the college knows that 
there's no need for someone 
just , uh , 
and that was very offensive too . 
last year , the , uh , lotus development company , the , uh 
um , um , oh , yeah . 
home repair . 
you were helping your parents . 
i still am really . 
they're , uh , sort of remodeling a house out in downtown atlanta , in candler park . 
and , uh , lots to it . 
we've taken out the glass and most of the windows and the sashes and replaced them . 
 so you're remodeling ? 
how about you ? 
well , i live in an apartment now . 
uh , two summers ago i went to massachusetts 
 and i went with a friend of mine 
and we undertook a building house . 
and this was a lincoln log house where you have the wall partitions 
and it's preconstructed you might say . 
and uh , we , started from an empty lot with , uh , 
and we had to cut them , uh , down and clear the lot . 
we had to call in the excavators and have them dig the basement .
well in massachusetts , i thought i was going to , 
well , it was a fun time 
well , all it ever did was rain and thunder storms .
and one thing is that we were going to pour the basement foundation . 
and we're in the process 
and it started pouring down rain . 
and i guess we had most of it done 
but the end was result , 
what happened was that a lot of water settled on the top 
and it really didn't give a very good finish 
and some of the , 
it was sort of sandy 
but it was okay 
and it's only the basement floor 
so it was okay . 
but , uh , it kept us pretty busy . 
it was only , uh , 
there was , well me and my friend 
and then we just had like two helpers and 
it wasn't , you know , like a commercial project or something . 
it was sort of just , you know , uh , my brother and well , maybe , you know , my cousin's coming over today to help us do that 
and then materials coming in 
 and so we're hopping around pretty good . 
but overall , yeah , we got it done 
and it's a three bedroom , two bath house 
and it's pretty neat . 
so , uh , i mean what was it for ? 
you just , 
well , it was , uh , for my friend's parents . 
they had some property there 
and they'd lived in this old , 
it's sort of like a farm , you might say . 
and they live in this old house 
and his mom just wanted a new house .
that has been her dream . 
and so , we did that . 
and , uh , she was really pleased with it . 
 so it came 
that's great . 
where you live it gets very hot ? 
and that's why you , 
what type of windows are you putting in ? 
 because the windows are something that is conducive to temperature changes in , uh , you know , the solar game ? 
have you , 
we just went into a building supply store and bought plate glass . 
my parents do not have a whole lot of money to put into it . 
 oh , okay . 
 and , uh , but it , 
see in a lot of the windows ? 
uh , the house is eighty years old 
and it's had several owners and stuff 
 and , uh 
oh , these 
so you have the sash windows in ? 
uh , did it go up and down ? 
oh , i see . 
and so we wanted to get all new stuff in there . 
there's a problem with those . 
those are , uh , 
they usually most of the time don't open very well .
ours didn't .
and the ones that would open , uh , wouldn't want to stay open .
they wanted 
and they , 
a lot of vibration 
and it causes the glass to crack 
 and it's 
uh , i haven't been in any really home repair things lately . 
uh , because i know that , uh , in using drugs i was not a good employee . 
and so i can see from the company's standpoint that there , uh , 
whenever you are an employee of the company , you are using its assets , 
uh , b , you are also under their liability , under the workmen's comp . 
uh , on my job we had a lot of workmen's comp cases 
where do you work ? 
and , uh , it's also a retreading plant , 
and that's where most of our , uh , injuries occur . 
and what we do is we'll have a drug test a break or a man , uh , has an accident . 
then he's automatically , uh , given a drug test . 
do they do it , like , you know , within hours of the accident , 
or is it ? 
and so , that kind of , uh , 
i don't know if it's been a deterrent or not , because we have , uh , just started using it 
now we've let some people go , uh , that found that drugs were used in their system . 
now , i don't know how t e c would handle it . 
they haven't pursued it , you know . 
uh , if there's some , uh , problem i know , 
there was one guy that we tested for preemployment for drugs who absolutely swore up and down that it showed that he was using amphetamines , 
and he went to a separate drug 
and they showed it negative . 
so i think the tests themselves are not really that 
i think that's probably true , too . 
that's sort of scary . 
and then i also had a friend who was just around some people that were smoking cocaine . 
and he tested positive on cocaine . 
yeah , 
that's a bad situation . 
i think most companies now , as far as entry ,
i think they should . 
i'm a t i employee 
in fact i , you know , 
some of the places now , um , like i b m don't allow them smoking , you know 
we have designated smoking areas . 
but , um , i work in sort of a building that's not really , well 
it's on the campus of the t i facility , 
but it's a little bit , you know , separated . 
we lease the building . 
and it's a factory environment . 
and , uh , they have designated smoking , 
but it's just wide open , 
it's not ventilated properly 
 and i think that's bad . 
but as far as the drugs , you know , being in the factory kind of environment that way 
because you're endangering everybody's lives 
in fact we've had the policy on just the random testing now 
and , uh , come up , you know , 
they never called me , 
they never , you know , 
and finally , the day we declared war was my time .
you're kidding .
has gone for about like three times , i think . 
and i told him he's obviously in a high risk group .
and of course , you know , they did specifically single them out when we started ,
the executives ? 
wouldn't that be awful 
which i thought was interesting .
oh , man , 
ooh , yeah . 
i can't believe i was so brazen before . 
like i say , i'm a former drug user , 
but , uh , i accepted christ as my lord and savior , 
and so i don't use drugs any more . 
oh , what kind of drugs did you use , if you don't mind ? 
 uh , marijuana , cocaine and amphetamines . 
um , yes , 
and all on the job , too . 
 you know , it had gotten that bad . 
well , it's really lucky that you got away from that . 
cause that's really , 
life is so much more enjoyable . 
and i was losing jobs just from doing a poor job , you know . 
that's it . 
i mean , you know , there's all kinds of drawbacks , much less the drug testing . 
just life in general . 
that's right . 
well i'm definitely for it . 
plus , you know , that you're working with people who are not only putting out their fair share ,
that's right . 
in some cases 
 like , uh , my husband , uh , several years back , worked for motorola . 
and they had , you know , 
i mean it was a chemical handling type . 
oh , goodness . 
i mean , and they have some serious chemicals out there 
like they have emergency shower where you just run in there and strip off and dump water , you know , that kind of thing . 
and they had people out there using all sorts of drugs handling those chemicals . 
oh , my gosh . 
and that's really frightening . 
so i think some you know , places like that , it should be like mandatory 
i would think there would be . 
well you'd think so 
but , uh , 
but they weren't ? 
i don't know if they do it till yet . 
isn't that awful . 
because when he was at , 
course now it's been years now , because the designated smoking 
i forgot what , 
i guess it was like eightyfour , eightyfive 
and at that time , they had no testing whatsoever . 
so that's scary .
that reminds me of , uh , 
i have a friend who was telling me about her brother who gets high all the time , 
and i have just casually asked her what he did for a living . 
 oh , lord . 
should we move ? 
let me move as far away as possible . 
that's awful . 
but , i'm proud , though , that , um , you know , i grew up in the sixties , 
and back then it was popular 
but people have really you know , become wise about drugs 
 and they really have a good campaign for the young people , you know . 
they know it's not smart , 
peer group is the other way now instead of , 
that's right , 
and that's good . 
that's the best way to stop it . 
it really is . 
 so it's good talking to you . 
 well , i enjoyed talking to you , cathy . 
are you on any kind of , uh , regular exercise plan ? 
what's that ? 
uh , it's a new , uh , form i think , 
uh , it's like low impact aerobics 
but it  . . . 
oh , instead of hopping and jumping you just step 
you have a step 
and you literally step up on the step and move your arms , 
it's new , 
it's fun . 
i probably couldn't do that because of my knee .
bad knee .
um , and , uh , i do toning a lot and , uh , some , 
every once in a while i play tennis , 
i'm not too great at it 
but i try to play , .
i've kind of gotten out of the habit myself , 
i mean , it's 
i guess what i do now is i play softball ,
that's about , 
well , right now i'm on two teams 
so it's four nights a week . 
but , uh , uh , so i enjoy it 
instead of having to join a health club and make myself go out there ,
i need to make myself do that . 
i slacked off a little because of , um , 
i'm about to graduate from college 
and so this past couple months have been really hectic 
so i haven't really gone , 
 and i've really been faithful these past two months of going to the health club and working out 
but  . . . 
what school you going to ? 
i'm at east carolina . 
but , um , no , 
i , uh , 
my step classes and toning is about the only thing 
well , i mean  . . . 
now what's toning ? 
is that lifting weights ? 
it's , um , like isolated movements for certain muscles groups , 
oh , okay . 
you can do with , 
isometrics , stuff like that . 
you know , you can do it with weights if you wanted to 
but , you know , you leave out of there 
usually the next morning , if you haven't done it in a while , you wake up the next morning 
what did i do to myself 
and your whole body aches , you know . 
um , i know i'm looking forward to getting back into getting into shape , 
uh , i feel like i'm out of shape 
but i feel guilty for not going ,
but , um , 
i played baseball ,
and , you know , working out six hours a day , usually six or seven days a week that kind of ,
oh , yeah . 
but , uh , ever since i got out of school , you know , just jumped right into the job 
because i work some weird hours and do some traveling . 
some , um , 
i walk a lot because , uh , you know , being in school we , 
i don't know if your campus was anything like ours , 
but our parking lot's in one end of the campus 
and the buildings are all at the other end , 
you ut , 
i didn't have , well , much of a problem 
  i guess i went to a small baptist school 
and we had about , when i was there , maybe thirteen hundred people . 
oh , okay , 
that's if  . . . 
so , it's pretty small . 
yeah . 
but i usually get in at least a couple of miles at work just walking around the plant . 
it's , uh , 
i live on the second story apartments 
so i walk up and down stairs all day long , 
uh , we've got a one story house now 
that's enough . 
i guess i push the lawn mower around 
that's one of the exercise , now . 
i , um , would like to start running . 
i've never been much of a runner 
but i want to start , 
i want to run 
but to do it . 
 , i'm afraid i won't be able to . 
oh , if you do , 
i wish i'd 
i hope not . um , 
we ride our bike occasionally but again not nearly often enough .
i don't even own a bike , 
i think the last time i was on a bike when i was about twelve , 
uh , i don't know , 
i'd be  , afraid i probably forgot how to ride a bike , you know . 
you can't forget how to ride a bike . 
but , um , no , 
i guess that's about the only form , 
i'm trying to think of other things that i do that will be considered exercise ,  , 
there are things i should do . 
i know it ju , 
now , when i was going to , 
i went to a junior college for a couple of years and played baseball and then transferred , 
well , when we were at this junior college , uh , our coach , you know , 
one semester the whole team was required to take aerobics 
and the next semester they were required to do weight lifting . 
so , they , uh , 
i mean , it was a regular , 
i mean , we had it for course credit , 
but still , i mean , it was pretty high impact stuff , .
those aerobic classes the high impact . 
definitely are tough classes . 
and she'd , uh , you know , 
most of the guys were all in one class 
so she'd kind of lay it on occasionally , you know , .
first at eight , i think we had 
eight o'clock in the morning , was our class . 
wake up . 
well , now they have uh , those exercise bands now that are better that you can use for like toning instead of using a weight , 
you have like bands , 
i don't know ,
they're just made of , i guess it's different kinds of rubber , 
uh , and they get , 
or sand even some of them , 
well , no , 
they're elastic 
so i guess it wouldn't be sand . 
and there's some that , like the different colors denotes how much the tension i guess they are and how easy they are to move . 
uh , i know there's purple , gray , and , uh , green . 
and some of them are real short 
and they're the ones that are the tough ones to use , you know . 
but , uh , those classes i enjoy . 
uh , i think , uh , with the aerobic classes you have to get an instructor that's fun . 
if you don't have one that's fun , and not acting like she's enjoying what she's doing , the class is not going to get out , uh , what they should get out of the class . 
uh , if the , 
so , are you going to get into instructing ? 
well , what are you studying ? 
oh , i'm an interior design major , .
oh , okay , 
 , not in the , 
i'd rather just be the student , .
and , uh , 
some of the nautilus equipment that i started seeing at the one that we used to go to was really interesting , 
i mean , they really know how to isolate each of the different muscle groups ,
but , man , they are , 
i don't know 
to me that was just too much of a hassle to get all geared up and take the time to drive over there ,
well , these computerized machines , 
and you set a speed on it and the weight 
and it makes you do it . 
and it tells you 
and , um , it tells it 
and the whole place can hear what this machine is telling you . 
a little negative reinforcement there while you're going . 
so , uh , do stuff like that 
but just i've never used those machines 
i just use the regular machines and the free weights , you know , like little five pound hand weights and eight pound hand weights . 
just to do , you know , some bicep , tricep exercises . 
situps , of course . 
 , yeah , 
that's where i'm really starting to get noticeable , 
i'm just getting real soft in the middle . 
oh , yeah , 
i think that's , uh , number one problem with everyone .
i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight 
nine or ten pounds , since i stopped playing , which was about four years ago . 
but real soft 
and i'm sure i don't have near the endurance that i did , .
but i keep saying i intend to get back into it . 
 , i just need to , put the old nose to the grindstone , 
i guess at that point it would turn into a task ,  , 
i don't consider it fun doing that , 
i plan on getting back , once i graduate next weekend . 
next weekend ? 
all right . 
one week , .
then i plan to get right back into it . 
you know , it does a lot for you i think . 
makes you feel a lot better . 
oh , no , 
the end result is great 
and i mean , i enjoyed , you know , 
when i was playing ball we could like run all day and not be tired , you know .
and i mean you feel so much better ,
just that , you know , you don't feel guilty when you eat that cake after dinner , .
oh , i still don't , 
oh , yeah , 
well , good luck on your graduation and your  . . . 
all righty , 
well , thank you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
ing seems to be a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to , uh , catch on , it seems , or maybe a generation to two .
and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up . 
uh , it does seem to be a lot of habits to break . 
i , uh , wasn't raised as a kid on it , 
but my kids are 
and so they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do , 
and we were doing all right there until , uh , the price dropped out 
 and they weren't worth anything anymore . 
and we  , 
it took us , almost a year to get a garbage sack full . 
we just don't drink that many . 
so as far as at home use , uh , we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something 
and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in , uh , 
at the time it was still , oh , about forty or fifty cents a pound , 
and we came out with about a dollar  , 
it just really wasn't worth it . 
and a lot of hassle all year round 
and cans laying , 
yeah . 
so , they realized , you know , 
well , of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old . 
uh , that was a big deal , 
but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it 
and then , uh , t i started keeping up with , uh , cans there , 
so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there . 
least it gets back into the system , 
but , as far as a habit at the house , uh , i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up . 
have you all got the individual containers yet ? 
i don't know if it was , 
i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time . 
but , if everything goes that  , 
i'm not sure all what we're going to have to do , whether we have three separate containers , 
i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything . 
it seemed like , uh , 
if i recall , it's been a long time . 
they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it . 
they were fine on the big green containers 
 but , uh , seems like they said they were just going to have a bin 
and all different types would go in there 
and then that they would sort it as 
it seemed that there was , 
at the time anyway , at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it , happen to do it pretty well , uh , those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting . 
but when it comes down to just general purpose trash , that all the houses , uh , 
the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor , 
so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than 
but i don't know , 
that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house . 
well , it would get messy , too . 
i know other places when they recycle , they have to , like , wash out their glass jars and 
that's true . 
i was brought up , uh , you know , long time ago , that they didn't even have cans . 
they had bottles 
and you'd return them to the 
and you'd get our money back 
and that was all well and good . 
they don't seem to still be doing that . 
if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass , 
but , i guess this day and age 
they don't do that . 
we live next to a set of railroad tracks 
and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there , by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to you know 
but , uh , they weren't that successful , 
so there were a lot of bottles to be returned 
and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted 
and they , uh , p , 
i think kids don't appreciate , maybe the value of money , that it's so little that they don't care , 
they can get more somewhere else . 
just a little bit of begging will  , 
uh , for a good , 
the nickels , the dimes or what , i suppose it might be quarters , fifty cent pieces in these days , that they would get , that much about a small amount of money . 
well , i wonder , 
but , we did buy a can crusher 
and we are crushing cans 
and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninetynine cents , 
so i would say 
uh , it was just easier liter bottle and then have it go flat . 
where do you take your cans ? 
well , as you say , it takes a while to build it up . 
since we've had the crusher all summer ,  , i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta , oh , 
i think the kids , when we were on vacation , they said they did take them to a recycling place , probably at one of the li , 
hello , lynn . 
do you have any pets ? 
oh , what are their names ? 
tibby and liberty . 
which is the dog and which is the cat ? 
tibby is the dog 
and liberty is the cat . 
uh , wife and i , we have two cats . 
uh , one's real nice , 
but the other one is a , well , 
she's pretty wild . 
oh . urs are pretty calm . 
are they , um , just house pets ? 
that's what ours are too . 
our cat we got from the pound the night she was going to be put to sleep . 
oh , really . 
oh , well , that's a nice story . um . 
do you want to hear about my other animals i've had ? 
i've had a skunk 
i've had a burmese python , 
i've had rats , 
i've had mice 
 uh , let's see , 
i've had gerbils , 
i had a son , he's now gone from the home , that was an animal lover . 
so at one point i had a snake , skunk , dog and cat running loose in the house . 
um , the skunk , uh , was it kind of like a cat to have around the house ? 
 and we had it perfumed 
 and , uh , it was very aggressive . 
but all three of them , dog , cat and skunk , used to chase each other all through the house . 
and the skunk . 
and the only thing we have with the skunk , he was very , very protective of his territory 
oh , yeah . 
nobody came near it when he was there . 
uh , i had a dog one time , 
and , uh , he chased after a skunk and got sprayed 
 so tomato juice bath , and , uh , get him cleaned up , 
ours would still back up to the dog or cat when he got mad and try to perfume them , 
but i suppose it was still in the instinct of them 
why , i don't know , 
i think they're kind of nice to have , 
they're kind of , you know , just relaxing i don't know , to pet and to , 
i don't know , 
when they like sit up on your lap and stuff like that , just kind of enjoyable to , you know , have like , 
i don't know , 
something giving you some affection as well . 
i always said if i di , 
what do you think ? 
oh , yeah . 
that'd be the best way to be . 
and he had dysplasia 
 and he had it for about three or four years where we just about had to lift him and carry him every place he went . 
so , when he died , we got a little one . 
but our shepherd was almost thirteen years old , 
and it just , you know , was almost cruel 
almost cruel for him to walk . 
he couldn't get up , 
he couldn't walk , 
so , he was a hundred and twenty pounds , 
so it was a chore . 
wow , yeah . 
so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if 
and then we've had three cats in our married life , 
and we've got a calico now . 
we've got a calico cat too . 
do you ? 
uh , we used to live in an apartment 
and like , our cats never went outside , 
but , um , the neighbors used to let their dogs out , 
and our neighbors were , i don't know , kind of slimy , 
and , uh , our cats wound up getting fleas , uh , from the apartment that we were in 
 so , we had to flea bath them 
and uh , it was an experience that they didn't enjoy at all . 
well , don't even talk to me , 
when i was single 
and my husband , then fianc3e , was to keep my cat , 
and he let her out , 
and my house was loaded with fleas , 
i mean , you walked in 
and your legs were just black . 
and we had such a time , and never got the cat back . 
i was a social worker at the time , and found it , 
now is it stacy ? 
angie , 
i'm sorry . 
well , now , so if you were going to have a dinner party , what would you make ? 
um , let's see , 
uh , i like seafood . 
uh , let's see , 
uh , shrimp , steamed uh , shellfish with maybe herbs . 
uh , spicy lobster with linguini . 
that sounds good . 
now uh , what is , uh , the steamed shellfish you said ? 
uh , i think hors d'oeuvres are good , too . 
uh , and that way , you can have a variety . uh , 
so if you have a dinner party and you're going to serve , uh , seafood for supper , what type of , uh , hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal ? 
like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or , 
fresh vegetables would be good 
or , uh , just , 
 and when you have the hors d'oeuvres ? 
and then when you serve the meal , what type of wine would you have with seafood ? 
oh , all these hard questions .
uh , what , white wine ? 
i'm not really a drinker , 
so i don't know a lot about that . 
something sweet ? 
oh , goodness . 
uh , chocolate , something chocolate . 
uh  , 
you must like chocolate . 
 well , let's see . 
usually when we have a dinner party , i like to grill . 
oh , you do ? 
so , we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe uh , some dip , uh , some cheese . 
one of our favorites is , uh , to take some , let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think , is that what comes in 
and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese 
and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail . 
and then i like to barbecue , like steaks or pork chops . 
and then oh , lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them 
and then , uh , i don't know what we usually have for dessert . 
cake sometimes , 
but , uh , that's what we would do for a dinner party , i guess . 
that sounds good , too . 
but uh , that's more for like when friends come 
i wouldn't be the big , uh , snotty kind . 
i just started , 
and i bought a martha stewart , 
i don't know if you've heard of her . 
her cookbook 
and she talks about catering and , uh , you know , uh , uh , different types of parties , you know , different types of foods . 
oh , well , do you work uh , in a setting where you , uh , are in the food business ? 
um , my father owns a restaurant . 
oh , uh , 
a cafe , 
so it's not really anything , you know , that i want to , 
it's not the same .
uh , it's in lewisville . 
all right . 
so you graduated from which high school ? 
trinity , 
that's public . 
huh , okay , 
i have to get to know this area a little better , i guess . 
uh , well , is your father's cafe , uh , one that you could cater out of ? 
um , and he's not interested in letting his twentyone year old daughter experiment with it probably . 
well , let's see , 
what else for catering . uh , 
let's see , 
what about hawaiian luau . 
oh , that would be good . 
could have , uh , uh , fruits and pineapple , uh , 
let's see , uh , 
and you could actually go with , uh , a chicken if you wanted to . 
i think decorating your food is , you know , really , 
uh , we have a sheltie collie , a miniature sheltie . 
do you ? 
it's oh , about six months old , 
and we're try , 
we live in an apartment , 
so , we don't have a yard , 
so it has to stay inside 
and we're having a difficult time trying to train it . 
how old is it ? 
it's about six months . 
uh , you're in the roughest stages of pet 
 but they're supposed to be real intelligent dogs , 
but i guess or every once in a while , you get one that's not so intelligent 
i've had dogs through the years . 
right now i've got two , and three cats , 
uh , and my son and daughterinlaw have kind of a sheltie mix , 
and we watched it this summer for two to three months , 
and it wasn't trained quite fully either 
 uh , but it was a sweet and an intelligent dog . 
so how do you , 
what's the best method ? 
i don't know . 
i'm old fashioned , 
and when i got when they did something i hollered at them and threw them outside . 
they say that's not the way to do it now . 
you're just supposed to 
stand outside with them until they . 
 catch them in the act . 
well , we're hardly ever at home , 
so it's 
and , you know , you don't want to spank it or scare it , or anything like that , 
you don't want to do that , 
but , uh . 
we try to take it , you know , 
it gets frustrating when you take it outside 
you know 
does it just want to sniff around ? 
does it just want to sniff around and play when it's outside ? 
and it comes inside . 
have you praised it and given it a treat maybe when it does something outside ? 
uh , yeah , 
and , uh , you know , there's certain spots in the house where he likes to 
and he chews on plants and all that , 
but , you know , that's natural 
that's nothing , huh . 
 well , i'll bet you . 
almost sixteen year old golden retriever , 
and she's gone the other way , 
because she's so old , she doesn't have much control 
oh , really . 
 so we're battling with that problem 
oh , that's sad . 
 and she still feels good . 
uh , she can't hear worth a darn or see very well , 
but she's got a great appetite , 
and she knows we're there ,
how old is it ? 
she'll be sixteen in may . 
but we can't bear to do anything because 
oh , of course not . 
i couldn't . 
and the la , 
two nights ago , she had diarrhea , 
and so that was a bad one . 
but , uh , i think we're buying a carpet .
that is really sad . 
what's the deal , 
we're trying to take it on walks now , you know 
 and we can't because it's not accustomed to being on a leash 
 and so i mean this dog really feels like it's being killed or something when you try to , you know , tug on it to walk it . 
i mean , it just goes like a mad dog , 
i mean it just jumps up and down and starts yapping , 
does it , oh . 
you know , maybe you can get it signed up this spring or summer for some of the dog obedience classes . 
well , we've heard some bad things about some of those , you know , 
they sometimes misuse their license or whatever 
they treat them bad . 
well , you know , we went to the junior college , richland 
oh , really ? 
 and we took , 
my daughter was living at home then , 
and she took the norwegian elk hound over there 
 and , it's a pretty good class , 
and they did pretty good , except this dog is , 
she's just pretty , 
she's not smart .
so , she didn't learn a lot , 
but i think it calmed her down a little bit , 
and she's used to being around other dogs now . 
how long did it take ? 
i think it was like a six week program . 
every , what ? 
uh , i think it was one night a week 
oh , really ? 
and , uh , you know , it was a group class , outside . 
it was fairly reasonable , too . 
well , sheltie collies are , you know , timid , 
and they don't really , 
unless they get used to something , they're really nervous 
um , our friend has a , 
um , i guess we're going to describe , uh , job benefits , 
and so what do you think , next to salary do you rank , is the most important job benefits ? 
uh , i would say the medical , uh , group insurance area 
well , um , does your company have good benefits in that regard ? 
i think , 
 uh , so it's different than a company where most companies fund almost the entire thing , 
where the school district does , um , the employee must pick up a greater figure in the way of , uh , costs . 
oh , yeah . 
but overall , um , i've been pleased with it over the years . 
i think the biggest frustration is because of the cost of insurance going up every year , our district has had to uh , you know , change companies , 
or now we're on a managed care thing , which has stressed a lot of people out 
i see . 
how about yourself ? 
uh , well i'm , 
my medical coverage is with an h m o 
 um , so , that's bordering on a health clinic , 
but it seems to be a good way to maintain costs and still provide a good amount of coverage . 
our district did that for the ninetyone and the ninety or calendar years , 
and i was in the h m o , 
and , um , i was because my same doctor , you know , agreed to be in it for , uh , 
they usually sign a contract or something 
 and , um , uh , i did have surgery last summer 
and i paid ten dollars when i went to see him that first day , 
and i've never seen another bill , 
so i 
but , again , i was fortunate because my doctor agreed to be in it . 
uh , if you've been going to a doctor for , you know , ten years or something and he elects not to join , it can be very stressful for 
that's right , 
i'm fairly young myself , 
i've only been , 
when i first started working which , 
three years ago is when i first got into full time employment 
 and , uh , at that time i immediately joined the h m o , 
and i never really , 
so the only doctor i've kind of consistently had has been through the h m o , 
and , uh 
but if you , you know , have a family just has , you know , all the medical history 
and you feel comfortable with it . 
i'm sure it would be very stressful 
and , my husband and i have just elected that if that happens , i will go and just pay . 
you can continue to go to your own doctor 
 but your benefits are not as , you know , good , 
so , uh . 
um , like you mentioned you work for a school system . 
i work for , uh , georgia tech in the 
 oh , all right . 
and i guess another one that i rank up there high is the , uh , kind of job flexibility and time off , um , i enjoy as a benefit . 
i do too . 
are you talking about like spring break 
right . 
getting a lot of breaks 
it really , um , 
i don't think most of our teachers , 
now i'm not a teacher , 
i am a secretarial executive assistant , 
but i don't think the teachers could stand the stress all year long 
it is just , texas has really , um , you know , 
they want everybody educated , no matter what it costs , 
uh , and it would be just , 
we all look forward to , 
like in two weeks we have spring break , 
what do you do there ? 
well , um , i'm not actually on the teaching faculty , 
but we have a large research organization associated with the university , 
and that's who i work with . 
um , and we're given , you know , a good bit of flexibility in what we do . 
we can kind of pursue our own interests in terms of the research areas that we study . 
well , that's good . 
i would think that that type of employment , one day you might be really tuned in and the next day , oh , a little luke warm or something 
 and , um , it's good that they allow you that . 
it , um , 
as i say , the schools , 
now we do have to work , you know , the day , 
but we do get many days off , 
and , uh , we all look forward to it . 
that's the only reason i work there , is that my children now have graduated from college 
 but at the 
 oh , yeah . 
 and , uh , i've just continued to , uh , stay there  .
the benefits ? 
i guess it took , 
so , have you ever served on a jury ? 
i served , 
i was in the air force , and served on a court martial , uh , board a couple of times , which is very similar to a jury . 
a lot of the same rules apply . 
have you ever served on one ? 
i've , um , been voting for years , 
and i couldn't figure out why i hadn't been called yet 
 and i finally was . 
so it was an interesting experience . 
uh , uh 
a grand jury or , 
 so it was a combination of , uh , 
and i was in the pool for a couple of weeks 
i see . 
 so it was a combination of criminal and civil , 
and they had , uh , 
 well most of the time we spent sitting around in the jury room and getting to know the other potential jurors 
 and then , it was always exciting when we got called to go , because then we thought we might be able to do something else besides , uh , just sit in the jury room . 
uh , did the judge , uh , hand down sentences 
or did you folks do that ? 
uh , yeah , 
uh , uh , i had a hard time getting seated on a jury . 
i kept getting , uh , 
i'd be questioned , uh , for empaneling the jury , 
course they don't have to give a reason , 
but it's just 
they want to get the best , uh , mix for their case , 
well i kept getting called up for drunk driving questions , 
and i think part of it was uh , they didn't like the fact that i don't drink any more . 
i see . 
because you'd probably be , uh , too puritanical 
that was 
although in my case i might have been more , uh , sympathetic with the person who got caught , 
i don't know . 
 so , uh , were the , uh , sentences that the judge handed out what you thought to be fair , 
or would , 
if you were deciding , do you think that they would have been different . 
well , i was never there for any sentencing . 
uh , i finally got empaneled on one case , uh , on my next to the last day , 
and , uh , we got into the , uh , jury room to , uh , decide the case , 
and there was one guy on the jury who announced to everybody that he didn't need to deliberate , because he'd already decided that the guy was , uh , not guilty , 
and he would never vote for guilty . 
so , uh , they appointed me jury foreman 
and i , uh , didn't think that , uh , going in without deliberating allowed us to reach a verdict , 
so i told the judge that we were unable to reach a verdict because we couldn't get one member of the jury to deliberate . 
so the whole thing had to be tried over again . 
i bet that made him happy . 
uh , it was funny . 
the , uh , 
i don't know , 
uh , uh , i didn't like not being able to deliberate . 
i wanted to vote guilty for the guy , 
and the other people were kind of mixed 
 so , uh , the guy had to go through the whole thing all over again . 
cost him a lot of money , 
i'm sure . 
oh , how many members were on the jury ? 
uh , it must have been six . 
that's kind of curious to me . 
i didn't realize until the , uh , wayne kennedy smith trial , uh , a few months ago that they had six member juries . 
i thought that twelve men tried and true , so to speak . 
but , uh , apparently for some crimes , it's permissible to have six people sit in judgment . 
i know on a  , 
getting to this unanimous thing , whether , you know , a jury should be unanimous or not , in a court martial case it doesn't require the jury to be unanimous . 
it's a simple majority , you know , rules . 
well , let's 
is it on , uh , capital crimes that they have to be unanimous 
i don't know , 
the two that i were on had to do with drugs 
 and , uh , we were , uh , unanimous is acquitting the person , even though we because of various things , 
the government really failed to prove its case , 
and , you know , being fair to the person , if the government doesn't prove its case , no matter how you feel , you have to go by what's offered as proof , 
and we had to acquit him in both cases . 
uh , it was too circumstantial ? 
uh , yeah , 
but something happened to the camera and the tape and 
all they could do was testify , 
do you ever think that there's a crime that's just so heinous and so bad that the person who commits this crime just doesn't deserve to live anymore ? 
that's a good question . 
uh , for a crime that he committed . 
but , uh , since i've become a parent and since i've seen , uh , things like jeffrey dahlmer , i really have to question that . 
i can't conceive of someone being that brutal to that many other people . 
and , uh , try and figure out what would be a suitable punishment . 
of the statements made by people against i like the statement made by cuomo . 
cuomo i believe is , 
um , he's governor of new york 
but , uh , he's , uh , against the death penalty . 
but , um , he said that if they did something to his wife . 
and that's , 
doing the things . 
oh , your gut reactions to something like that versus an intelligent reason response . 
uh , and that was the thing that , uh , killed dukakis back , uh , four years ago when someone asked him a similar question 
and he thought for a second and gave a thoughtful well reasoned reply when , uh , people wanted to see if he was going to go for an emotion 
and i think that the people who are strongly in favor of the death penalty are really working from that gut level . 
uh , you know , whether it be a biblical force , uh , you know , the eye for an eye , a tooth for a tooth , a life for a putting , uh , murderers up in federal pens for the rest of their life , uh , while we foot the bill . 
i think people a reason humane one . 
see , i don't think the decisions that are going to be made on the death penalty until we decide what our prison system is intended to do . 
are they reformatories , where we're trying to take people who can't survive that we work well together . 
or are they , 
is it a penal institution ? 
is it designed for punishment ? 
um , the death penalty surely fits in well uh , in a penal situation where you're trying to punishment . 
uh , perhaps not in the manner that we do it 
in theory it fits in . 
in a reformatory , i mean 
if you put someone to death you obviously ,
that's true . 
uh , the other argument is that the death penalty is a deterrent 
and i really don't , uh , agree with that . 
but , oh , if they catch me they're going to kill me 
so i better not do it . 
i just ,
i don't think it's done . 
i don't think we run it as a deterrent . 
i mean people say that , 
but , i mean , if it was really a deterrent , i mean i think like horse thieves in the old west , you know , 
they saw other horse thieves hanging by the necks 
and deterrent , i would think that it would be public . 
i mean i don't think it would be this private thing because nobody ever sees it . 
if someone ever , 
if , you know , 
like say some young kids or something like that that might be inclined more towards a life of crime , had to sit and watch or , you know , something or shot by a firing squad or something like that . 
i would think you'd make a bigger impact on their life rather than , you know , telling them that there's protestors out here at the , you know . 
well , i don't know if that would really work that way or not . 
uh , there's a lot of violence , 
um , are you working right now ? 
uh , yes , 
i'm working in the computer science department here 
what kind of work do you do ? 
uh , i'm doing basically system design 
me too . 
i work at , uh , the georgia tech research institute . 
um , i'm a coop student 
so i work and go to school about halftime . 
and , uh , i really don't have any job benefits to speak of . 
we're kind of , um , 
i don't know , 
they just kind of forget us on that end . 
we don't really have any vacation or , you know , sick days or health care or anything really 
so it's pretty fair they've got you slaving away ,
what about you ? 
well , um , i'm research stuff here now 
so they have , uh , um , okay , benefits package . 
it's not quite as good as industry 
but one of the significant , um , benefits here is that you can take , uh , up to two courses a semester , um , 
and they 
uh , they do that i think if you're , uh , research   here 
then i know of some of the people that have gotten their masters 
and i think that , um , they might , you know , pay for that .
but i know they'll let you decrease how many hours you work by   kind of percentage . 
you know , they'll let you work halftime if you want to finish , 
if you want to , 
you want to , 
they'll let you work , decrease your number of hours by any percentage just about so if you want to get your masters 
and then , i think of course with your extra degrees you get a pay raise due 
so in terms of other things , other benefits other than sort of monetary 
you know , i , 
we have to contribute a certain amount , uh , to it . 
and it's kind of split between c m u and , 
i think ,
i think my , 
i'm still covered where he works , 
and right now it's , uh , the , 
like everywhere else , uh , 
here in pittsburgh the health care , uh , rates are going up pretty quickly . 
 that's a whole other topic 
 they have . 
but you are right . 
that's pretty important . 
well , working here , besides i mean 
i'm learning and stuff because ,
now that's a big win . 
that's about the only real bonus 
 so i have to take that into consideration when i evaluate like how much i get paid real , you know , because if i was working somewhere else i'd have to , you know , pay an extra five percent ,
i figured for 
and they've just raised the , um , income caps on social security to the point where 
well if you could call it a benefit that c m u , i mean i , 
the other thing that they allow you to do here while you are working is consult for , um , you know , other companies . 
oh , yeah ? 
um , so that kind of helps out in terms of ,
 you know , in case , 
  help a lot . 
see around here it's like , uh , 
we pretty much work from project to project well , you know , with different sponsors . 
there is not a whole lot of , you know , funded research from , 
type of music is hot down in texas ? 
uh , well , i don't know exactly what's hot down in texas . 
i know what's hot down here with me , 
so that's about all i can feel apt to discuss with you since i just know , 
i don't ever listen to the radio 
and that's usually what's hot around here 
oh , okay . 
uh , mostly folk music . 
folk music . 
well , we're on totally different wavelengths . 
i'm more , uh , old rock and roll , uh , some newer , i guess you would call it heavy metal rock and roll type 
what about , uh , classic rock type stations . 
uh , i don't listen to the radio at all . 
we live in a fairly small town , 
oh , okay . 
so , some 
i didn't like , uh , 
they started getting a little more , you know , 
the type of music , at least to me , only sounds good at a high volumes 
and i don't like listening at high volumes . 
but , uh , some of their older stuff was , uh , you know , quite enjoyable to me . 
well they , 
you know , hotel california and that era . 
doesn't even sound good loud really . you know . 
you know , definitely . 
uh , so , anything new you like coming out now , other than folk music , some i might know of . 
i don't know any folk music at all . 
well , down in texas , uh , you know , listen to a little country every now and then . 
i'm sure there's a lot of that down there . 
oh , plenty . 
way more than i can stand down here . 
i don't care for it at all , that texas twang or whatever you want to call it . 
well , there's a conway twitty twang , 
then there's the , uh , dolly parton , uh , hollywood sound . 
but , uh , it's uh , uh , getting pretty big everywhere , as i see it . 
garth brooks is outselling guns and roses 
i think some of them , the artists are even , uh , hitting the pop charts . 
it's kind of strange that it's getting as big as it is . 
concert tours for country and western sings quite odd , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
music is kind of going an odd direction nowadays , i think . 
it's becoming not necessarily good music , just popular music , you know . 
i think most artists are in to make a few bucks . 
and that's all it , 
but they're not in it to say anything or give a message 
late sixties , early seventies , they were 
that's what it , 
that's what you say , 
and then music is wrapped around now . 
now , it's the other way around . 
i don't think gun , 
at least to my mind , guns and roses doesn't have too much to say . 
they don't have anything really important you want to hear . 
but , you know , it's kind of odd , 
it's like , it doesn't have to be good , 
it's just who does it , you know . 
you hear a paula abdul song 
and you , 
and i think , if somebody else were to play that , you know , everybody would think , that's lousy , 
but because she did it , it's supposed to be good , you know , 
it comes to the point where it's your name , not what you do 
madonna can do anything 
and it would be considered good because it's madonna , you know . 
madonna could start playing folk music 
and folk music would be huge just because madonna does it , 
it's the artist , not the merit . 
so , i don't think that's a good thing at all , 
but the , point we've reached , 
so i don't know how 
well , i don't know , 
i know for myself that , uh , for the most part , i don't know which artist is which , 
so i listen to a song , 
i either like the song 
or i don't like it 
 and then if i really like the song , eventually i'll figure out who it was . 
that's about how i am on popular music . 
i don't know enough about it because i just listen , 
uh , everything i listen to is what i buy , not whatever they play on the radio 
well , you have to figure out what to buy , 
or do you just buy along the same artist ? 
uh , i , 
i don't really switch around to new things very often . 
you know , it's way to hectic and too confusing . 
so you keep buying the same artists until you don't like an album , then you stop ? 
or , about the only new music i hear is somebody else that i know 
and i listen to it that way , 
but as far as , 
i don't go out on a limb and buy something new very often unless i've heard it . 
see , that's one thing i like about uh , some of the folk music scenes , you know , 
there's a couple of nice , uh , small coffee houses up in new jersey . 
and , it's very nice , 
you go into the coffee house 
and , you know , an artist is there 
and very often the artist will have an album 
and , so if you like the artist , you buy the album . 
so you definitely get to try before you buy . 
that's definitely 
you know , it , 
you don't always quite get it right , 
okay , 
you go first . 
 well , i have , uh , two kids , 
i have one seven and one five 
 and , uh , they're in a public school here in tyler 
and , uh , i'm happy with it . 
i'm happy with the school , 
it's great , 
good teachers 
good curriculum , uh , 
they learn a lot , 
they have no problems , uh , 
but i do live well , in the best part of the city , 
though , i live in , you know , the real richy part , i guess . 
i'm not , 
but , everybody around me is 
uh , but they're , 
i have friends that live in the other , the less fortunate or whatever you want to call it part of town 
and their schools are kind of rundown and , uh , older 
and they don't really offer as much , i don't know , as , uh , the school that my girls are in . 
i don't really think that's fair .
uh , but , you know , i'm happy with what they're in , 
so , go ahead .
well , yeah , 
going to say 
there's a lot of disparity between different neighborhoods and what sort of schools go in . 
uh , i grew up in new york 
or not new york city , upstate new york 
 and i went to , uh , the city of rochester school district 
 and a lot of my friends were in one of the neighboring suburbs 
and we weren't too far removed geographically from each other , 
but the difference in schools i think was pretty substantial 
 and , uh , one of the things that probably would have been better had just one school system . 
and that uh , could result in more equitable distribution of money 
because what was happening was , you know , all the very rich people move out to the suburbs 
and the city had a very low tax base so they didn't have a lot 
as a result , the schools were rundown , 
there wasn't as many , you know , of the nice supplies in science class that we would have liked . 
there wasn't as many advanced placement courses , uh , when i was a senior 
and , uh , it , 
so of competency almost , would be to expand the size of school districts so you get a wider variety of people , 
and the rich people will either pull their kids out of the public school and put them in private schools or 
so , you know it's kind of , you end up chasing , like a dog chasing its own tail sort of . 
also , uh , the family environment , 
you know , you can come to south tyler where i live 
and you have got room mothers in every room , 
you've got art mothers , 
you've got every holiday , 
there's parties . 
all these kids have these really supportive parents , always up there for 
you can go to north tyler to the schools 
and the parents might not could even tell you what their kid's teacher's name is .
uh , that has a whole lot to do with it , you know , 
as far as their learning , i mean , if the parents aren't , uh , you know , willing to go with the kids and find out what they're learning and if they're learning 
why is that ? 
they just don't , 
i'm up there at my kids' school , 
i know what they're learning 
and if they're up , i call and find out , you know , 
is she having problems , 
does she need help with anything , 
she's doing fine , 
okay , you know , uh , 
and i know kids that their parents could really give a rip 
and the kids 
they have no motivation from home , 
so they just go to school 
and , you know , eh , you know , i'll get through the day , and , uh , bring homework home 
uh , just , you know , they take a notion to do it , 
they do , 
and , uh , that doesn't work either , you know , 
they have to have guidance 
and there's nothing , you know . 
i know that was a big factor for me . 
i ended up coming out of the public school system very well 
ended up getting some scholarships to go to college 
was , like , well , 
of course you're going to study and do well 
and that's the way , 
of course , are you , 
the last auto repair i had was 
i have a nineteen eightyfour nissan truck 
i had a tune up done 
and i had the brakes done on it 
and then , the reason i did that was because i don't have a scope 
and it has eight spark plugs 
and it's hard get at them 
and plus the time on them . 
i just don't have time any more . 
uh , i usually change the oil and wash the air filter 
and to have to change the battery once , 
but , i was really surprised that the brakes .
i wanted , 
i do have the background . 
i know what needs to be done 
and i know that the oil should be changed very regularly and all of the bearings 
and the lubrication system needs to be lubricated and 
so i stay on top of that 
but i wanted my front wheels , 
i wanted the bearings packed 
and they wanted something like fifteen dollars , uh , a front or something like that 
or maybe it was thirty dollars to do it 
just to pack the bearings ? 
but what i found is that they had a brake job 
and they , 
i had them , 
the other thing i let them do some times is that i let them go through and let them do the diagnostics . 
that's free , 
and then i can decide whether i want them to do it or whether i can do it , see . 
and they told me that my brake pads were gosh , you know , seventy percent still good , you know , 
but still it was cheaper in the long run 
and uh , 
so i just got the the brakes done 
and i thought that was a good deal . 
 and plus 
and they repacked the wheel bearings . 
but , uh , i've had considerable experience . 
you might say i'm , uh , uh , good back yard mechanic 
and you know , i took auto shop in high school , 
it's been a while back , 
but i still have a pretty good feel for it , 
but one thing i didn't know is that when i was messing around with cars and stuff and most of the cars , 
i had bigger cars 
and the brakes go out fairly rapidly on those 
and what i was surprised at is that on my little nissan i bought the truck with about sixty thousand , i have almost one hundred and ten , 
so i drove on those brake pads for , uh , you know , fortyfive thousand miles 
and there was hardly any wear to them . 
so those small little trucks and cars like that , the longevity of the brake pads is really good . 
you know , they've gotten to the point that they don't weigh very much 
and the 
so you know , i just did it anyway . 
i like to stay up on it . 
and then if you go and like , just about any you know point in time and pull my dip stick and pull it out and look at the oil , the oil is you might say , uh , a white golden brown . 
you know , it's not dirty . 
that is the key to the longevity . 
 so how , 
 uh , and my experiences have been kind of contrary to that . 
uh , i get a little more involved in the maintenance of my car 
 and one of the things that i did was to change the pulley system on it to use under drive pulleys so that the engine doesn't have to turn the accessories and can use more of the power to the rear wheels 
 uh , the only catch was the first set of under drive pulleys that i put on it were , uh , not even cast aluminum . 
they were just pressed aluminum . 
you're talking about the vibration dampener ? 
well , there's three pulleys that you change . 
you change the crank pulley 
that's the vibration dampener , 
so , when i changed those over , i put on these pressed aluminum things 
 and , uh , probably about four months ago the water pump decided to go out . 
uh , oh . 
so in the process of seizing , the belt spun on the pulley and wore 
uh , oh . 
so , i was on my way to work one day 
and , uh , the water pump pulley split laterally in half . 
 so there was half a water pump pulley still attached to the water pump 
and the other half was kind of dangling off the end of the crank 
 and uh , i , 
so , the topic is hobbies .
in your spare time . 
who has spare time  ? 
um , i don't really do any handicraft things like that . 
i used to do , like salt ornaments and things . 
but that was , oh , good many years ago 
i usually go do aerobics and read , 
and that's ,
i understood that . 
 you know , i work full time 
and i have two kids 
so my spare time usually involves something with the kids . 
you know , hobbies , 
i can't really say that we have hobbies . 
it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend . 
well , well , that's what i meant by salt that we did that like as a family , little ornaments and ,
i've just never been very skilled at ,
and the things i've tried to do just don't look very good  , 
as some needlepoint . 
i've done mostly cross stitching . 
i used to , uh , do like , um , 
one that i did for both kids are like , oh , 
they're plaques with , you know , different kind of animals 
and then you have their birth date on them , 
and then you have a little picture of them 
and you frame them and stuff , 
but nothing steady . 
just when i get some spare time here and there i'll work on it , 
but , you know , it's nothing that i ,
it's not ,
not at all . 
i don't even know how to knit 
and my mother used to knit , you know , 
and i don't even know how to knit  , 
i'm like , that's a lost art from this family .
so , um , 
but , it's not a very good topic 
it feels like ,
not when you're n , 
neither one of us are really , 
i have seen things i really like ,
but , it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it ,
it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made .
  i don't know what , is , 
it's like there , 
but here a lot of the country stuff is in , you know , a lot of the woodwork , a lot of , uh , stenciling . 
and , you know , you can go to like a flea market and stuff 
and there's just tons of stuff everywhere 
and then on weekends they go out and sell it 
and during the week they go back and do some more . 
and see , they do that as their job . whereas ,
and they make it cheaper .
and , i mean , i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that 
because i can remember when i used to do , you know , those figurines and things . 
it was relaxing , you know , creative , 
you felt very creative . 
but , it just was time , 
well , i think we're okay . 
i think we did the five minutes , 
so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore .
well , thank you . 
i hope you have a good rest of your weekend . 
where are you from tina ? 
um , i'm from maryland 
and , um , i have one son who's almost sixteen months old . 
are you married , or  . . . 
you are . 
i have two children , 
i have a seven year old and a three year old . 
uh , so i try to spend as much time as possible with them . 
that's good . 
uh , what kind of things do you do ? 
well , um , we do a lot of things with them , you know , 
taylor my youngest is , 
or my oldest is in school 
and so she has a lot of school programs and things like that . 
was it a big change in your life , to , uh 
oh yeah .
my husband , uh , is working you know , most of the time . 
he's working long hours , 
but , uh , 
uh , i'm just working a couple days a month , 
and , um  . . . 
what do you do during those days ? 
um , we spend a lot of time at the playground 
and we go to the zoo , 
and we go 
and we wa ,  . . . 
well you said you worked a couple days a month , though , 
what do you do ? 
i'm a nurse . 
oh , are you ? 
so , yeah , 
to get interested in a lot of things , 
so , um , 
i understand that , 
they really grow up quick . especially at that early age . 
but my wife was , uh , 
she worked parttime when my oldest was little 
and now she's staying home all the time , 
but , uh , that worked out really well because it's a big transition i think to have children . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , to go from , you know , nothing , you know , 
if you want to do something every night that's fine , 
but when you have children it doesn't work that way anymore , 
that's right , 
and i think a lot of people are realizing that 
but still there are so many people that you know , have their careers first 
i agree with you , 
i think that my wife leaned that way 
and i'm really glad she did 
and , you know , i'm glad she's staying home , 
but , you know , i know there are some days when she wi , 
i know , .
that's why i like to work a couple days , 
i think uh , 
well that's why i'm glad my wife did too , 
'cause she worked either two to three days a week 
and that got her out of the house 
and yet she'd get to spend , you know , three or four days with  . . . 
most of the time at home , 
and so . 
uh , we had started out like that 
and , um , i think that was really ideal , uh . 
i do to , 
i agree , 
but then when you start having two of them , it's , you know , a little bit tougher ,
it's difficult , 
are you from the maryland area ? 
and , uh . 
where are you from ? 
um , uh , i'm in dallas , texas . 
in dallas , 
so , uh , i've lived here like eight years or so , 
my wife's from fort worth . 
oh , yea , . 
i work for texas instruments . 
so that explains . 
well , um , i don't know , 
we do a lot of things on the weekends together , the family , 
but , uh , as far as during the week , it's usually , uh , you know , just my son and i , 
and we're  . . . 
what's your husband do ? 
uh , he works for coca cola . 
so uh , he manages a plant out here , 
and it takes a lot of time . 
oh , yeah , 
i'm sure it does . 
but , um , it , you know , 
we take walks ,
but , um . 
what , uh , 
my wife did some teaching at uh , like a private tutoring place .
and so to be able to spend more time with the kids at night and stuff ,
i mean , i'm perfectly capable of doing it for them , 
i guess they get used to it . 
but , you know , we'd go to the library and do things like that , 
that's good , 
i know my husband was real , uh , 
in the beginning when a larger plant 
and from our home , 
uh , so it takes him a little bit of time . 
oh , yeah . 
and i'm not able to work during the week , uh , because of that . 
i was working in the evening , 
and he was coming home 
and i could go to work , 
but , uh , 
he , you know , 
just the time that they were spending together , 
i think it really helped to have that time together . 
it really does 
because i think you know , you grow closer . 
uh , was your husband , i mean naturally a child , 
i mean had he been around children , 
or  . . . 
uh , oh yeah , 
and we have thirteen grand , 
well his parents have thirteen grandchildren . 
so uh , you know , there's a lot of kids in the family 
and he really enjoys it . 
but , uh , right now it's kind of a difficult time , 
but  . . . 
and the cost of living here is just so tremendously , you know , outrageous .
um , it's difficult , uh , to do it any other way . 
i understand . 
i , you know 
it's hard because , you know , 
then you're not getting to spend as much time at home , 
i mean your husband is not getting to spend as much time at home as he'd want to . 
that's right . 
so , yeah , 
that's a tough situation , 
but then again , you know , some , 
you got to do what you got to do ,
at least , i just consider myself blessed that i can stay home .
it , uh , 
well like i said my wife normally feels that way , 
i'm getting out . 
i know .
so she's had about enough during those days , 
the way that , you know , we , jus , 
like what you said with the cost of living and everything , i think a lot of people can't afford to get by on just one salary an 
and so i think that's in families and family values especially . 
oh yeah , 
it has . 
and i really think that that's one of the problems the nation's facing that , you know , we need to do something about , 
but i don't know what . 
i believe that too , 
and i think , uh , the kids are where they need to , you know , 
they need to really focus on the children in this country . 
would you have said that a couple of years ago , do you think ? 
vaguely aware of it , 
but , um , it wasn't really that important to me , 
and , uh ,  . . . 
it's amazing how your whole focus on life changes after you've had a child . 
oh , it really does , 
just the whole , uh , you know , 
seeing how you really are forming this , 
well , you know , in the next year or so , you'll see so many instances where , you know , he'll mimic something that you've done , 
and you see , you know , everything i'm doing , he's learning from . 
that's right . 
you know , that's how they're developing their patterns . 
and i think a lot of people either , don't care , or don't realize it , you know . 
or they just put it in the back of their mind and let it slide . 
it's true . 
but it , um , 
i know , 
even just this first year , that i've been with , uh , my son , here , um , he's , 
i can just see how much ,
part of you too , 
i mean , you get to stay home , 
i mean it's not just for him , 
but it's also for you , because you're both kind of bonding together there too , i think , 
that's true . 
well it's been nice talking to you . 
well it's nice talking to you , too . 
good luck . 
lynn , do you want to start ? 
do you want to tell me about summer vacations you've taken 
well , i tend to , uh , take two kinds of vacations , the vacations to visit family 
which is your favorite ? 
oh , well , i couldn't live without the family vacations , 
but , uh , my favorite is and , uh , see places that have interested me since i was a kid ,
and , uh , 
your family doesn't live close , then ? 
uh , they've been in san diego for the last few years , 
and they're moving to florida . 
and that's one of those things , 
you just have to go once a year . 
i understand . 
so , uh , basically it sorts out into that , 
and then about once every three or four years i try to get over to england , because i lived there for a while ,
i've only been there once . 
and i'd love to go back . 
beautiful country . 
and it was , 
beautiful people . 
but , uh , 
and i'd real , 
we had a great time . 
and my husband has been hearing about these people for years 
uh , but he's never met them , 
so , uh , i'd like to do that . 
but anyway , that's our typical vacation , 
and , uh , we enjoy the family vacations , 
but the other ones are very special getaways , 
and we probably take one of each every year . 
how about yourself ? 
well , uh , we , as you do , take family vacations , uh , sometimes one a year , 
but this year we're not going to be taking one for several reasons . 
but vacations we really enjoy , 
i think we've been on three cruises . 
oh , i've never ,
and we , 
we've gone on carnival cruise lines . 
and , uh , we've gone fairly inexpensive as most cruises go . 
uh , we usually book just a month before it's ready to go . 
and we get upgraded . 
last two times , in fact , we had an outside room 
and it was beautiful . 
and we like not having to take our suitcase in and out of hotel rooms and drag it all around . 
it's kind of , 
well , what do you do on a cruise ? 
i've never been on a cruise . 
oh , my god , you do everything . 
i mean , you can be as busy as you want to be , or as laid back as you want to be . 
you can sit in the sun all day around the pool , 
or you can take part in the games that they have going on . 
they always have bingo . 
they have a casino . 
uh , they have a massage parlor . 
they have exercise , 
i mean , you can do anything . 
and that's just aboard ship . 
and then when the ship docks , you get to go sightseeing and shopping . 
and that's quite fun . 
and where have you been on these cruises ? 
uh , nassau , san juan , saint thomas . 
we've been there twice . 
we went two cruises that hit those islands , but with different people . 
we've gone with friends each time . 
i see . 
and then we went to , uh , the western caribbean , which is , uh , port , uh , cancun , cozumel ,
 oh , the mexican coast . 
pardon me ? 
that's all mexico , i think . 
but it was wonderful . 
so we really like those . 
and , uh , i guess we just like to go someplace entirely different . 
we've been to a few places in this country . 
we still have a lot to see , though . 
where are you from originally ? 
we're from illinois originally . 
and we've been down in texas eighteen years , 
and so , like you , we always try to make it , you know , back home to see the relatives . 
we both still have family there . 
and that's fun . 
it brings back a lot of memories . 
oh , yes . 
uh , things are different there , though . 
they're , uh , 
i don't know . 
it's just entirely different world than this area . 
well , i grew up in dallas , 
so i mean , 
did you ? 
and they're going now to florida , 
and so they're going very nice places , 
that will be a pleasure to visit and get to know . 
i really came to love san diego and feel very ,
they've been there eight years . 
and , uh , you know , i just grab the car and drive everywhere . 
oh , that's great . 
so it is nice , 
but it's not home . 
this is home , 
um , and i've never thought about a cruise . 
it's so funny . 
oh , they really are . 
yeah , as i said , we've done them three times . 
we'd be going again this year if circumstances hadn't changed . 
my husband would , you know , 
the minute i said the word , he's chomping at the bit . 
he kind of likes the casinos a little bit . 
but i like all of that . 
what's the best part , from your point of view ? 
i like seeing other countries and shopping in other places . 
i like shopping . 
i can shop anyplace , shop in london and france and wherever . 
now , my kids are moving to toronto , 
so we're going to be able to go up there . 
oh , that will be nice . 
so i'm kind of looking forward to that , except i hate to see them go . 
oh , sure . 
well , don't go in the winter . 
oh , that's what everybody says , 
and i think it's , 
i think i'll try to stay away , except in the winter in january . 
so that will be hard to stay away from . 
well , there are exceptions made for special occasions like that . 
but the ordinary thing is to stay out of the north in the winter and get out of texas in the summer 
isn't that the truth , 
huh . well , that sounds wonderful . 
i would contemplate going on a cruise , uh , oh , all circumstances permitting it . 
well , there's all age groups too , 
and that's kind of fun . 
uh , if you sit at a table with a lot of people for your meals , you meet different people . 
you may meet people , you know , thirty years older than you , or younger , 
and everybody is really interesting , 
and everybody is there to have a good time 
huh . how long are the cruises ? 
uh , we've only gone on the seven day cruises . 
they have shorter ones 
and then they have ten day ones . 
but i think seven days is long enough for us . 
by that time we're ready to get home and get back to our routine . 
i think most vacations , uh , seven days is enough for us . 
we've gone , 
i think when we went to england and france , we were there ten , twelve days , 
and that was pushing it a bit . 
uh , i tend , when i spend enough money to go overseas  , 
well , that makes sense , it really does . 
i mean , oh , we went to panama too . 
oh , that's interesting . 
went to panama last august . 
our soninlaw is from panama . 
and , uh , we went with our daughter and soninlaw to visit his parents , who live there . 
and his father is a doctor 
and his mother is a kindergarten teacher , 
and they took time off , 
it was their winter 
and they were having a little break , 
so they took some time off that , uh , they could show us around . 
and it is a beautiful country . 
it is beautiful . 
they have mountains . 
we were an hour away from the mountains or an hour away from the shore . 
that's really nice . 
and it is gorgeous . 
they live in a small town called david , which is northern panama up near costa rica . 
and , uh , it's just a gorgeous country . 
most people don't realize it . 
i think if they could get tourists coming to their country , they'd improve the economy considerably . 
huh . well , maybe now things are calming down again .
we really hope so . 
well , that's really great . uh , 
i mean , as i said , basically all i've done is go back and forth to parents 
and , uh , 
well , that's pretty good . 
  my husband had a conference in l a , 
so we spent a week in l a 
and of course , 
oh , do you like l a ? 
uh , i'm very unusual . 
i like , 
you ready ? 
what have you seen lately ? 
well , uh , it's funny , when i tried ,
i thought , 
i hadn't seen anything since dances with wolves 
but today i went to see regarding with henry . 
oh , i'm dying to see that . 
it was really good . 
 uh , jeff wariner just got out of the hospital 
 and , uh , jeff and deeanna went and another friend in the neighborhood , 
and , uh , we all liked it . 
we had both moms and , uh , fifteen year olds and a twelve year old 
oh , my goodness . 
 and , uh , 
 oh , well i am just dying to see it . 
i went to dinner with some friends last weekend 
and we'll all go see regarding henry 
well , my son had gotten to see a lot of movies this summer , on , choir tour and 
so , uh , 
finally , it's my first summer movie .
oh my . 
well , let me see . 
was it , 
well , we went to see one hundred and one dalmatians last weekend 
and that may be , 
we're going to the movies . 
and we won't , 
well she goes all the time 
but i go maybe once every couple of months . 
and when i go , i go see two at a time . 
so we went to see soapdish , 
 oh , was that good ? 
 oh , hysterical . 
we laughed so hard , 
it was just , you couldn't hear half the dialogue because everyone in the audience was laughing 
 well , i want to see that and city slickers both . 
i love 
but , that's what i was  , 
 that's the other one that we went to that night . 
 oh , was it ? 
and , my face hurt so bad ,
and course , growing up on the back of a horse , you know , and being on ranches and stuff , so much of that was so true 
and i was absolutely rolling in the aisles . 
it was so funny . 
both of them were great . 
oh , well good . 
i'm glad to hear that because they , 
 oh , they are 
we just laughed so hard . 
and like i said , i mean with soapdish , it is so cornball 
and it is so overacted that you're just hysterical 
they just carried it off ,
well , i don't know if you got to see weekend , um , at bernie's 
they had a free showing at the berkeley , um , united artist . 
how neat . 
and , i don't know who was here or whether jay called a friend 
and we didn't think we'd have much chance of getting in 
but we thought we'd try it , you know , free movie . 
it was so funny and it sounds like , uh , what you were just describing , soapdish , too . 
i mean , we hurt by the time we came out . 
 oh yeah . 
and the whole theater was hysterical 
and it's just goofy . 
i mean , it's , uh , 
if you have a chance to rent it , at least , 
or it should be out on t v , i would think , 
i think it is . 
um , cause it's just a fun summer light comedy , 
make your cheeks hurt laughing . 
especially in the theater it was contagious , you know 
i imagine the way soapdish was , but , with 
 oh gosh 
 i never laughed . 
and people were just screaming and applauding 
and , you know , it was just hysterical . 
well , i'm glad you did that before your surgery .
oh , me too , because i don't even know if i could live through it now . 
i mean i'm getting around real good 
and i'm just still real sore . 
and today course i went back to work two weeks after , uh 
 oh , gosh . 
 but see i don't have permanent work . 
right now i'm working with a temporary agency . 
and so , the second week i was out of the hospital i went up and worked half day on the computers cause you can learn all the software for free . 
oh , so i went up to do wordperfect cause that seems like that's what everybody wants , 
and i was up there half a day and came home and collapsed . 
and then they called me to see if i wanted to work a day . 
and i went 
and of course it took me the whole weekend to recover from that . 
and , uh , i worked about three days a week ever since , two to three days a week . 
and so i went to my doctors last thursday , 
and this was my fourth week checkup 
i just can't get over this . 
if you want to play ball , you can go play ball . 
but you can 
and , uh , you know , he was teasing me 
you'll be out there waterskiing , 
i can just see it now . 
you've only got two more weeks . 
whatever you call easy , i'll do it , you know . 
just not cutting it . 
and so , when i'm still sort of on the sore side . 
well , what's your next , 
have you seen robin hood yet ? 
and so i 
 and to uh , try and find time it's hard , uh , with jim's schedule , too , just to get a time that we can both go . 
 oh yeah . 
and , uh , i'm holding out for city slickers for the two of us because , uh , we had friends that went to see that and said , you know , it's just perfect for our age group 
he needs a comedy , too . 
uh , and that's what he would have liked to have seen regarding henry , too , 
but knew that , uh , 
we've got a lot of company this summer , which is wonderful . 
we're really enjoying it 
but some of the different things we're doing , uh 
and well , realistically  ,
but , uh , jay really liked robin hood . 
um , when the choir group went to see backdraft and they thought uh , it was funny cause he sounded like the critics . 
he said , you know the plot line and the characters , uh , you know aren't real big 
but you know 
but , he thought robin hood was great . 
it was real different then you'd expect , 
but h 
 oh really ? 
and so , 
 well i went , 
course i am a kevin costner fan . 
me too . 
i really , uh , like him a lot . which is why , dances with wolves was the last movie we had seen 
gosh , was that wonderful . 
it was , 
i , uh , 
in fact , uh , a friend from germany was visiting in march 
and we didn't , ran out of time , we wanted to take him to see it . 
we were going to sit through it again cause we really wanted him to see it , too . 
 oh , yeah . 
uh , i just thought that was terrific . 
and i really enjoy harrison ford which is one of the reasons i wanted to see , 
i do , too . 
i think he's really good . 
and he's very good in regarding henry . 
that's not an easy part to play , i don't think .
i wouldn't think . 
well , my kids are going to their dad's tomorrow night 
so i sort of think i may go do that . 
that one won't your sides .
um , it , 
was this the first time you got to see one hundred and one dalmatians ? 
i hav , 
my parents took me when i was probably somewhere between ashley and jamie's age .
and we went to the , 
okay . 
so are you a golfer 
or are you a spectator ? 
oh , i'm a , 
i play golf 
but i don't actually play golf . 
well , i'm the same way . 
hack it all over the place ? 
um , uh , well , in the carolinas it's just , you know , we've got a bunch of golf courses around here . 
we've got tons up here 
but i don't know . 
how do you feel about your game ? 
i guess that's a good question ? 
uh , well , i mean i'm not a serious golfer at all , 
uh , uh , a friend of mine goes golfing a lot 
and he drags me out every now and then 
and i don't really even have a game . 
i usually 
when i go out and play golf it's usually like at one of these par threes that ,
but , um , i like watching it on t v . 
i like that too . 
i don't know 
i try to play , 
but god , a couple years ago i played two , three times a week and got lousy . 
i guess that's the best i ever got was lousy . 
and i thought i was really improving and the big break was going to come 
and then i got worse again 
to get me i can't hit it up in the air . 
so i'm pretty bad 
but i get great distance hitting it , you know ,   across the ground , 
and if it's going over water or something one of them have to take the shot for me because i'm , 
but i'm getting better . 
i've got where now i can hit it in the air some of the time . 
that's pretty good . 
uh , so i'm kind of a novice at it . 
um , i'm that and worse . 
i play 
next year i , 
actually i take it kind of seriously 
but i've been doing so bad . 
i always say this every year , but next year i'm starting over from scratch . 
i'm going to go take lessons and everything . 
i'm going to do it right , and see if i can actually play this game or not . 
well , is get some kind of lessons or something . 
because my tee off is not bad , 
i mean i'm good up to everything else putting and stuff like that 
it's just , that initial tee .
what do you do when you're putting ? 
that's a good thing . 
that's something i could learn actually . 
that's when i do my worst . 
i finally get to the green 
and i think i'm doing all fine 
and then , 
just walking around the hollow and making sure there's not really , 
you know , checking the ground and so forth , you know . 
see how it's going to break or whatever . 
can you really see it though ? 
what about the speed ? 
if you get down on the ground you really can . 
how fast you're going to hit it ? 
um , well , you know if it's up on a slope that you've got to hit it not kill it 
but you've got to hit enough speed and the right angle that it's , you know , 
because when it's going up a hill it's going to break in a direction . 
but you can feel that ? 
i don't know 
get it within like , you know , four or five feet or something 
but i don't have enough field . 
now i'm t v watching . 
they make you die at the hole every time . 
 oh , it just dies and rolls in . 
i don't know , 
 but i , 
it's hard for me . 
it's like i said 
once i get up on the green i'm fine , 
but that tee shot , uh , it , you know , 
when teeing off i'll go probably a hundred feet across the ground 
so it takes me awhile to get to the hole 
once you're there , you're all set though . 
i'm all set . 
i'll get us there 
and you put it in . 
  that sounds good to me . 
i s , 
oh , the t v golfers they do that . 
it takes them two to get there and two to get it in 
so it's fifty percent . 
and me it takes me five to get there and five to get it in . 
well , two or three to get it there 
and then , that's according to the hole 
and it ju , 
uh , uh , maybe one or two putts . 
that's good . 
but the friends i play with , uh , they play all the time 
and they're really good . 
joe pros ? 
uh , they're not joe pros 
but they golf in the high sixties low seventies 
so i guess they're pretty good .
that's pretty good . 
for eighteen ? 
that's pretty good . 
i'm talking to the wrong guy . 
your shitty golf is probably the best golf i've ever seen . 
that's not my golf . 
that's my friends . 
i'm usually in the eighties or nineties 
so i'm not good .
when i'm in the nineties i'm feeling good . 
i'm usually around a hundred . 
that's my thing . around a hundred . 
you know , i can hit a great drives and think i'm going to do all awesome on this hole 
but it ain't going to happen . 
well , teeing off i either slice it 
or i hook it ever single time 
and i alternate . 
well , it's a good thing with me i slice it every single time . 
that's good . 
i aim , 
okay . 
universal health insurance , 
what would we like to say .
i think , 
i think that's what the subject is about . 
did you read , uh , the article in the paper today about this particular subject ? 
i guess i did not . 
uh , the state of washington and the state of minnesota is , uh , going to begin testing a state funded program for citizens of those two states 
and there's fourteen other , uh , states that are considering it . least according to the article in the paper this morning . 
i think it's a trend that's , uh , probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need . 
it's getting to a point that you have to have it , 
you have to have some form of health insurance . 
well , it's been interesting that we , 
extremely expensive , though . 
so we live in a society , though , where everyone if you ask them on polls , will , uh , say that they think that everyone has a right to health care . 
and yet , i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it . 
uh , unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are paying for the people that don't have health insurance . 
which is why people are talking about  , 
we ought to just admit it perhaps 
i don't think you , uh , 
you have health insurance ? 
through your company ? 
but i have been in a situation , uh , recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year 
and my wife developed cancer . 
we didn't have any 
oh , my goodness . 
and it was a 
how was your care at parkland ? 
uh , because it was a life threatening situation , it was very good . 
uh , or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland . 
but , yet , parkland is not free , either . 
it's not free , 
but , uh , 
is it affordable ? 
so you did have a good experience . 
i had a bad experience as it turned out . 
uh , i was fortunate that there was parkland . 
is your wife better , i hope ? 
that's all right . 
that happens . 
it does happen , 
but it's very sad . 
but in any event , uh , i'm in favor of national health .
actually , uh , i'm a pediatrician 
oh , is that right ? 
 and i feel very strongly about , uh , children , and , uh , developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic 
so , uh , i'm really quite active in trying to , uh , be proactive at least for children's issues . 
it's very complicated , 
but , uh , i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization , glasses , hearing aids  , basic health benefits . 
well , when i grew up and 
i grew up in south central kansas , uh , 
we had , 
and my mom worked for the county health department 
and we had xrays every year , 
we had a dentist come to our school and , uh , check our teeth once a year at least . 
uh , we had all our flu shots taken care of , our measles , mumps , rubella and all that other stuff . 
and , uh , when my children were growing up , we didn't have that . 
we had to pay for it , which i wasn't opposed to paying for it . 
i had the money to pay for it , 
but i'm sure that there were people that don't . 
well , and so much has gone up so much . 
the cost of immunizations for example , uh , and just  , the legal benefits , uh , 
that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily , et cetera . 
so , well , i don't know , 
it is interesting , 
in case you didn't know , texas leads the nation in uninsured children . 
thirtyone percent of all texas children 
did not know that . 
so , uh , one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care . 
and i work in the children's parkland system 
and it's pretty overwhelming to me . 
but , uh , it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county . 
so now what are your opinions on recycling ? 
well , i definitely think that we need to start recycling . 
i think it has got to be an individual responsibility until , 
i think if we wait , uh , which is happening until somebody says we have to do it 
i have heard reports around here that the landfills will be full by the year two thousand . 
i have heard that too . 
and that is not too far away , 
but i don't know how it is there . 
it is very difficult here even if you care like i do to do much . 
i take , my paper , 
i can take plastic and paper bags back to the grocery store 
 and i can take plastic like milk cartons or if they have water in them 
and there are some fire stations i can take newspapers to 
and that is very inconvenient cause i have to wait until i have enough of them to make the trip worthwhile . 
well see , i started saving newspapers 
and i would take a ton of them 
 and , uh , i can't remember where i went to take them , 
but they wouldn't take them . 
it is real hard to find a spot 
and then , i don't know if you note , even doing that , the amount of trash we throw away is incredible 
 oh i know . 
it could be recycled , 
but there is no place to , 
there is no really recycling facilities . 
we have a pilot program in arlington going on i think in the north part of the city where they the trash as they put it out . 
i think that is a good idea . 
and i think that is what it is going to have to come to . where we are just forced to . 
besides , well like a law or whatever . 
i think so , 
just because they have to .
and you get ticketed if you don't do it right . 
and i think it is going to come to that because some people will just not go to the , 
it's trouble for me to do what i do 
 i mean , i am willing to do it 
plus you have to have a place to store all of it 
 and see i live in an apartment . 
it is very difficult . 
like our garage is always full of sacks of newspapers 
and , so , i don't know . 
i think there needs to be more places 
and also i have a real strong opinion . 
in iowa , the state i am from 
every time you buy a container , no matter what it is , whether it is glass , whether it's a beer can or a fifth of whiskey or a pop or whatever , you pay ten cents for it 
 and then you take it back to the store 
and you get it back . 
uh , so that way it kind of forces you to recycle . 
you are forced to . 
and , uh , you also don't see the litter there . 
people just , 
that's true . 
it makes it worthwhile to take it back 
and i've just started drinking a new water called clearly canadian , 
i don't know if you've tried it 
 and they have on the ba , it's five cents , that they pay five cents 
 and it even shows the states that , 
that take them back . 
well , some of them are five , some are ten cents . 
i am looking at it right now . 
is texas one of them ? 
so , i have to throw them away cause there is no place to take glass . 
i don't think that there is enough being done . 
now , i work at j c penny at their corporate headquarters . 
and we have a paper recycling program that , uh , is company wide 
and i do the recycling for that . 
do they save like the paper they use at the office paper . 
and i know there is a lot of computer paper 
but , uh , we use to have , uh , 
i mean , i don't even remember uh , i mean , the money that they've made from the recycling program . 
they have donated it to charities . 
i mean 
something else i think we can do is support companies that encourage 
like , i have decided downy fabric softener now has where you can buy a little carton 
you add wa , 
well , i image everybody else will start doing that sooner or later , 
but i am going to stick with downey because they were first . 
and i want them to have my business . 
and i think packaging could be done much better . 
there is so much plastic . 
 well i know , 
you see some of the stuff 
and i think that it's just people have got to be aware . 
unfortunately , there are a lot of people that just don't care 
and they don't want to think about it . 
that's true . 
you know , i want to feel like i at least tried . 
and i don't know . 
it just may overwhelm us here when we run out of places to put it . 
then we will be forced to . 
it may be too late . 
i mean , i don't know that much . do they not ever burn trash or anything like , 
that's another thing that , 
 see there were no , 
then , that's pollution . 
i know amway . 
i use a couple of things from amway that it says this is burnable material . 
well , that doesn't do me any good because i don't have any place to burn it . 
i know . 
i guess you run into the pollution factor . 
and then just like the glass bottles , that it says on the bottle i can get ten cents , but not in texas . 
and there is no place i can take glass to . 
so , i still throw away a lot of glass . 
it is really sad . 
and then the packaging thing really grips me . 
you buy some 
and it's got a great big piece of cardboard and a great big piece of plastic , 
well , uh , i myself am not in favor of drug testing in the work place except in this , uh , very specific examples such as , uh , transportation workers , as in , uh , air traffic controllers , bus drivers and that kind of thing . 
um , i don't really think that it's , uh , too many , 
i think it's a severe invasion of somebody's privacy to say , well , we're going to look at your urine and then decide whether you're , uh , you know , worthy of working for us . 
i really don't see that that's a very valid , uh , thing for a company to say , 
and personally , i don't think i would work for somebody if they were going to reject me on the basis of what's inside my body . 
uh , i guess i basically agree that , uh , 
do you think it's okay for a company to reject somebody knowing that they'll take drugs ? 
i mean suppose they found out some other way ? 
 well , a drug test does not necessarily imply that someone is taking drugs or not taking drugs . 
there's too many cases where it can , you know , 
there can be false positive results , and that sort of thing . 
i don't think there's any definitive , you know , 
okay this person is taking drugs , 
so we don't want him here . 
uh , like i said , some industries , though , i think it'd be very necessary , 
i wouldn't want any air traffic controllers high or anything like that when i'm flying in an airplane . 
but , uh , a big deal . 
i mean , if your employer's not going to trust you 
or , you know , it , 
i think it's a whole trust issue . 
i just can't see it . 
but , have you ever been in a situation where you were drug tested 
uh , yeah , 
i once too , 
i mean it's very humiliating , 
and , i mean , i'm not speaking in favor of drugs or against drugs , 
but uh , i am totally against that sort of a , uh , 
i had it during a job interview , 
and i just thought it was dumb of the company , at a point where they were trying to convince me to want to work for them 
that's basically my opinion on it , right there , is that it's just , you know , 
i was in the same sort of situation as , 
it was a job interview 
and then you had a physical , where you were drug tested , 
and it's , 
i just , 
and i know people who have been drug tested and who have not , you know , been hired by a corporation which , uh , you know , 
i really . 
the other side of it it's my bodily fluid 
and i don't really want you to look at it , or 
just to the fact that i don't know that it is a company's business to regulate what its employees are doing when they're not at work . 
but when it enters into what they're doing when they're not at work , i find that to be fairly offensive also . 
well like you say , i mean , if it's not a critical kind of job where someone could get hurt , then really the employer ought to be judging you on how well you do your work 
and , i mean , if you are doing drugs and it's causing a problem , then they'll notice it for other reasons . 
that's exactly right . 
and also i just think it gets a lot , 
i'm a big , uh , supporter of personal freedoms and personal privacies , 
and i think that it just moves down along a line if most people went down that line into regulating employees' lives outside of work , you know , 
there's already talk of people , 
well , we're not going to hire you if you smoke . 
but when somebody leaves work , i don't think that it's the employer's right to regulate their life style at all . 
well , do you think it's , should be illegal for an employer to do this 
and other than that i do not think it should be allowable . 
i think it should be illegal for them to want to do that . 
it's kind of the big brother syndrome , 
i mean , i just , 
anything like that just kind of scares me . 
i tend to view it , 
even though i don't think i'd work for a company that did that , i sort of want to defend an employer's rights uh , in addition to an individual's rights , 
but an employer , really , i think , has the right to hire someone on any basis they want to 
 and if they say they don't want smokers , i sort of feel like an employer should have the right to decide whether they want to allow that . 
uh , and i don't really , 
okay , 
but anyway , uh , well , i do take care of pretty much all of the stuff for my wife and for me 
all i do is , uh , keep a list of things like debts that are outstanding and every two or three months update that and every once in a while make a list of what we spent that month , 
but i doubt i do it more than three times a year . 
i'm in computer science , 
yet i 
uh , i don't even use a calculator for the stuff i'm doing because it's all pretty round numbers . 
mine is really simple , because i got all our bills paid off when , uh , he was a marine , 
he went to saudi arabia 
and while he was gone i got all of our bills paid off , 
so really the only bills i have is rent , utilities , insurance 
so they come in , 
i pay them , 
and that's it  , you know , 
that's about 
i don't really have this major budget or anything . 
i'm real thrifty . 
i take care of , you know , two children and me and 
so , that's what i do . 
it's pretty straightforward . 
it's almo , 
i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making 
it seems like if you're getting to that level , you're not in real good control . 
you know , i mean , i've never liked credit cards 
and you pay twice as much for it when you get done .
actually , i mean , i like using credit cards for everything , but just paying off the bills 
and i don't have to worry about keeping records of anything else 
i don't have 
but i found out a credit card was one of them .
it's so much easier , you know , if something's on sale if you're a woman and you're a sale person , 
let's go grab it , you know  , 
uh , and if you don't have the money , then use a credit card , 
so , i got rid of them credit cards .
yeah , i guess if that's 
that was my weakness .
it wasn't bad , 
i mean , i didn't have like thousands of dollars , you know , and like that , 
i just 
but i , selfemployed , you know , 
i have my own little cleaning business type thing , 
so , uh , i keep , 
do you find trouble keeping the records for taxes and all that 
i just keep it in a notebook and write down what i've made and , uh , you know , what it's going to have to go for that month 
well , that's good to know . 
so , i always do my own income tax , you know . 
do you ? 
i don't understand the idea of paying somebody to do it . 
it seems like it's absurd the number of people who end up having to pay somebody to do it . 
all you got to do is i mean 
just the form . 
i mean , it seems absurd that people will pay , you know , some bucks just to get 
and a lot of them . 
it's dumb .
i guess if you had some really complicated stuff , 
but i don't , 
so , i don't mess with it . 
but , i don't use a calculator either , you know .
that many , you know , things to add up 
i know too many people who use a calculator 
if they make a mistake , they find out two months later because they weren't paying attention . 
oh , yeah . 
 and we have a , 
i bank at n c n b here 
and they have a number that you can call in , 
and i always call in like , once every other week or so 
and i will , uh , check off what checks have cleared 
do you do that ? 
we have the same thing . 
you do too ? 
and i always check them off and , you know , check my balance and my book you know , because i always want to know exactly what i have , you know . 
i do that real often . 
i do that , 
so anyway , 
so , what are your views on capital punishment ? 
i have ambivalent feelings because i don't think it serves as a kind of deterrent we would like to think it is . 
 but , on the other hand , it is very expensive to maintain , 
you know , texas has one of the biggest criminal justice systems in the country . 
and it's eating us alive budget wise 
and , uh , 
so are they currently practicing capital punishment 
but the nature of the , uh , courts and the appeals and the stays and all that means that it's a very long haul before anybody's ever executed . 
that's similar to georgia . 
and then , i was reading in the paper just this morning , it's interesting because i had forgotten , i guess , that i wrote this little topic down , that it costs more to execute somebody than it does to keep them .
that's probably true considering , 
uh , i guess in a way that , it kind of defeats the purpose of having capital punishment if , 
well , i think capital punishment is supposed to be primarily a deterrent to other people .
that would be the intent of it . 
but i'm not sure how successful that is . 
well , i think it would be more successful if it was applied in a more expedient manner , if there weren't so many 
if the person who's going to commit the crime 
what kind of work do you do ? 
uh , i'm a research engineer , 
i work , uh , with georgia tech . 
um , well , see , i'm a school principal . 
elementary school . 
and in a very poor section of town with predominantly anglo kids . 
and i see kids already that are going to be criminals 
and , see , i'm afraid i think if we would take the equivalent amount of money and invest it in young people , that , 
i mean , course , you couldn't do that because you got to do something with the ones that are already there 
 but i think we would make a bigger investment in kids , 
we'd have fewer decisions to make .
um , that's probably true , 
but i guess 
oh , yeah . 
but , pumping more money into the school system is a 
but it's not going to , 
oh , i see . 
see , i'm talking about , 
like , in , 
uh , i'm afraid i think that there are kids who just ought to be taken out of their homes and reared . 
uh , i know the institutions don't work that well , 
but it's a bad day because i get all these kids through my office . 
i have a school of five hundred and thirtyseven kids . 
five hundred of them are good , solid kids 
and i have the same thirtyseven in my office every day . 
and a lot of their parents are totally irresponsible . 
some of them in the penal system . 
so that's a difficult situation . 
and , you know , you just see those kids going down the road . 
now , not all of them will commit offenses that have to do with capital punishment , 
but some of them have already been in youth centers .
and if we had something to do before they get to be fullblown adult criminals , 
and i'm not talking about necessarily in the school system , 
i'm not sure that the school system should be the agent of all the social action . 
i think that's one reason we have problems in schools , uh , 
and some of them are our problems , 
but a lot of it's because everything society wants , we are supposed to do . 
but that's another subject 
well , that's probably true . 
anyway , i dealt with two or three kids today that are going to end up where somebody making a decision what to do with them . 
um , yeah , 
i guess that's not an easy solution . 
there's no easy 
i don't know that there is an easy solution , 
but if you could find a way to prevent some of it , and i'm not sure what it would be . 
do you know it costs more to keep an inmate on death row than it does to send a kid to harvard ? 
that's true . 
i'm sure it is , 
statistically , that's true . 
um , yeah , 
i don't , 
certainly capital punishment isn't 
are you for it ? 
i'm for it in 
i guess i am 
in certain crimes . 
what kind of crimes would you use it for ? 
uh , premeditated murder .
any mass murderer type individual . 
i would consider it for sexual abuse of children , on going .
well , you always have castration .
well , you know , somebody elected that recently . 
i read about that .
and all the civil rights people are up in arms about it , you know . 
but , uh , 
well , um , i used to work in a day care center . 
i worked um , in all the different areas of the day care center 
and they can be deceiving to people . 
i did not work there long because i couldn't handle the treatment that the children got , 
and this is supposed to be a very wellknown center here in tyler who had two or three , um , centers ,
and they would , um , be one way when the parents were there and be another way when the parents left . 
so , um , i think um , to check in on them when they're not expecting it . 
because they do things differently when you're not around , 
well that , 
i know wh , 
the things that we kind of looked at is you want to see how many teachers you have .
because we had one that sounds kind of like what you were in . 
it was a really good one , 
and in fact , it worked out for us because we kind of bartered . 
my wife did artwork for them 
you know , so we got our day care free . 
but they didn't have enough teachers 
 well , this one was set up good . 
i mean they had two teachers 
and they had a good system like so when you walked in , everything looks cool . 
the problem i had was that they did not show affection to the children enough . 
they did not show them care to these small children who are being left . 
um , they , 
one time i picked up this little boy who was crying 
and the owner came and just chewed me up one side down the other .
this child was crying and needed some comfort , you know , 
what is your problem . 
so , um , 
did they separate them by age group ? 
because you know , i think that's one thing that was important . 
the babies that didn't walk in one room .
then they had like the , um , three year olds , upper fours , lower fours , upper fives , lower fives . you know , just like that . 
you know , they really did separate them well . 
it sound , 
it was just the teachers themselves . 
that they're not , 
affectionate people that they're kind of par , 
their system , 
was great 
but , um , you know , the caring just wasn't there . 
the one woman that did the babies . i worked with her 
and she was fabulous . 
she loved them babies , 
and she loved them and cared for them . 
but , um , every one of the others that i saw was just screaming and yelling and , um , you know , would make me a nervous wreck , 
so , you know . 
i think that's probably a really important thing because you can have doctorates and p h d's and all that kind of thing and , you know , know all the technical stuff , 
but if they don't reach out and touch the kids , then that doesn't do any good . 
these kids are just in a day care center all day 
they're just there .
the other group that we had was kind of interesting . 
the other one we went to it was a husband and wife team 
 and we knew them from other associations 
but , uh , it was kind of interesting because she was kind of the strict one , 
and i think , you know , she'd put her arm around the kids and talk to them and stuff , you know , 
but he was actually um , the more , uh , what , demonstrative type .
he would , you know , laugh with the kids and play with the kids 
you don't see that much . 
so they had a really nice balance . 
we liked that one . 
in fact , it was called humpty dumpty play school or something , 
that's cute . 
 but they also did some of the teaching things 
and then they had , um , you know , 
obedience was important . 
that has to be with a day care center . 
 uh , oh , i think they used the , 
you probably heard you know , where you stand in front of the clock and get your power back to control yourself . 
that's a new one , 
 and it's one , 
uh , i can't remember what they call it actually 
but you just stand them in front of a clock 
and , you know , it has a secondhand that goes around . 
and they have to stand there , 
 um , what's our topic ? 
do we pay too much ? 
um  , 
well , do we ? 
i guess that , 
i mean it all depends really on what kind of bracket you're in . 
my tax bracket is pretty high up there . 
i generally pay the maximum tax bracket . 
and , uh , i think that we're paying too much 
because i don't have any children . 
and i pay a lot of property taxes . 
oh , sure . 
you know , i don't use an awful lot of city services . 
you know 
and , um , a dib of the federal money 
and i just , 
many times i end up feeling like i'm paying too much in taxes . 
how about you ? 
do you pay too much ? 
uh , well , no , 
i'm a student , um , 
and i work as a coop at , uh , georgia tech research institute . 
and , uh , i'm going to get back i mean most of what i pay in taxes 
uh , and , uh , 
 well , when you 
i'm sure .
um , you look at your paycheck 
um , what kind of , 
uh , well have you pay a lot of in ta , 
have you been out working and then gone back to school 
or into college ? 
i went , 
well i did work , um ,   for some time 
but i didn't make enough money to really make ,
to worry about it . 
concerning this ? 
uh , i haven't done any of that type of work myself . 
um , but every once in a while when i hear up here the congress , 
um , congress has added too towards the members bank there , you know , 
there's a bank that they all bank with , 
and i guess it went defunct recently . 
and one of the congressmen about a thousand bad checks . 
and all those bad checks ,
and , um , it's causing quite a stir up here ,
it's really kind of curious to watch this thing occur . 
oh , sure . 
um , i think we pay too much . 
and i look at my paycheck 
and i make , 
well , let's see . 
they take out in state and federal taxes 
 i think i pay fortytwo percent . 
fortytwo cents out of every dollar i make goes to the government , 
and then they charge me sales tax 
and they charge me gasoline taxes , 
and they charge me all these others , 
and it's just too expensive . 
i can't believe that 
i'm just thankful that i don't get all the government that i pay for . 
you know what i mean ? 
have you used , um , student loans and things like that that were guaranteed by the government ? 
uh , my tuition . 
so , uh , i haven't made use of that . 
what are you studying down there ? 
physics . 
oh , that sounds like a fun field . 
 heavy science . 
are you like in the particle research or anything like that 
or is it more , um , applied physics ? 
um , i haven't gotten too terribly much into my major yet . 
actually , um , the degree i'm getting is physics . 
there's a different one for applied physics 
so i guess you could call it more straight stuff 
well maybe you can figure out how we can stop this inertia that's ,
i doubt about that . 
pretty steep compared to most countries ? 
i don't think so either . 
 um , like europe ,
but they do have socialized medicine and things like that . 
and , um , i know i was reading in the paper i believe yesterday that , um , they're talking , 
or maybe it was on the radi , 
i don't think anybody pays too little . 
i would tend to agree very highly . 
i think that we're all paying a little bit too much taxes and not seeing too much good come out of it . 
do you get hit up for local taxes there ? 
here in indiana uh , we pay county income tax , state income tax , 
we pay five percent sales tax , 
uh , you name it , they tax it . 
oh , so you get the whole smorgasbord . 
that's right 
well , i actually live in new hampshire 
which is probably pretty nice , 
but i'll bet that means your state sales tax is pretty high . 
the only problem is i work in massachusetts , 
so they 
but , it , 
well , you know , we , 
it's only a state tax here , no local . 
we've got a five percent sales tax . 
but , uh , the problem is that i'm paying state tax even if i don't live here . 
but , at least on things like stock options and things like that , they don't tax me . 
so that's not too bad . 
uh , just too much tax . 
i worked in a factory , uh , last summer 
and , on the average , i was losing twenty percent of every paycheck to taxes 
and i don't feel that i really get a whole lot of return from that . 
i mean , i don't utilize you know , it really , any government welfare services . 
of course , i drive on the roads 
and i , you know , went to the schools and stuff , 
but i really feel that i'm just getting overtaxed . 
oh , i mean , you know , when you figure out just on feds , you know , i actually hit the thirtyone bracket 
and also , you know , then you figure out seven or eight percent for f i c a 
most people forget about them , because you know , you can't always get your f i c a back at the end of the year . 
you know , and then , you know , like a five percent surtax , i'm paying forty percent tax . 
which is just outrageous 
and a lot of it , 
and if you look at the way the government is run these days , it just seems like a lot of it's going to waste . 
well , certainly are some things where you need infrastructure 
and you need 
there are things government does better , you know , 
i think government does a better space program 
but , you know , i think , you know , you look at things like , you know , tax subsidies to tobacco farmers 
that's right , 
got to keep those farmers happy . 
so much of it , is now just going to service debt or 
they are a fat . 
you know , i think the military is really fat . 
i think that a lot of the h e w services , although they're providing necessary services , have too much fat in them . 
there is just way too much bureaucracy 
and so much of that tax money is going just to keep that bureaucracy running , keep the paper shuffling around 
you know , like we , 
i mean , we spend a fortune for things like v a hospitals 
and , you know , then you look at how well they're managed , you know , 
i don't think we're getting our money's worth out of there . 
i think it's all going into bureaucrats . 
and a lot of it's feeding that . 
and just the whole , 
it seems like everything is really screwy right now as far as our whole economy in general 
and our taxes just are going to keep rising no matter what happens 
and especially when you've got the bush administration who has increased government expenditures , uh , beyond what any other president since world war two has done 
and yet 
well , be , 
right  , 
the great communicator , 
 i mean , i just read something that , two thirds or three quarters , i'm not exactly sure of our national debt was created during the reagan bush era 
 oh , oh , yeah , 
they think , 
oh , yeah , 
congress , they're the fault for it . 
but , you know , the other thing is , it's tricky , though , 
well , yeah , 
then , you lose half your jobs in new hampshire 
you lose , 
grotten connecticut goes , 
so , you know , you know , it's very tricky to balance that stuff off , because then you hurt , you know , 
if people lose their jobs , then they become a load 
and they're not contributing taxes . 
that's right . 
so , you know , it's very hard to say , you know , this is what we should cut . 
it's really , 
that is the , 
especially cuts in the defense is really a catch twentytwo 
that's going to lower our national expenditures , 
but then you're going to have people on welfare 
and they're not 
who aren't contributing . 
so that's really , 
and , uh , in our , 
i'm glad i'm not the one who has to come up with these policies . 
but , what's very funny is in our town meeting they were v , 
both for our school district meeting and our town meeting had this proposal which , unfortunately violates new hampshire constitution 
course , the only problem with that is then nobody paying for the necessary services they don't use . 
that's right . 
uh , okay , 
let's see , 
i guess , uh , i can start . 
we're actually trying to find one now because 
are you really ? 
uh , so i'm looking at , uh , something larger than what we have . 
we've got , like , an eightyfour charger that's about gone and uh , an eightynine horizon . 
so , i'm looking for something , uh , littler 
which are both kind of small . 
uh , so we were thinking mini van for a while 
and , uh , we're looking at , uh , some just four door , five passenger sedans 
are you looking for an american car 
or , you open to buying foreign cars ? 
uh , i don't really have a preference either way i guess .
you know , it , 
i guess the american cars had a bad reputation 
personally , i have a japanese car right now , 
and i really like it a lot . 
uh , i think the japanese really build good cars 
 and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole , uh , you know , buy american , keep american auto workers working right now , 
but i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our , uh , car manufacturers have for a while . 
if i were to buy another car , uh , i would be partial to buying another japanese car , 
but i would also look at american cars , 
but when i bought the car that i bought now , i did that also 
and i just felt that the japanese car was a much better product . 
i mean , e , 
so , if i were , 
i j , 
there's a door seal that doesn't quite seal 
and you have to take it back every once in a while . 
it's clearly just a design problem there . 
it is . 
uh , i'm kind of , 
right now , 
the next car i buy is going to be sort of a sports car . 
i would really like to have a sports car . 
uh  , i don't have a family , 
so i don't need a mini van or such to , uh , haul people around in . 
so i'm looking for more a two passenger car that , uh , 
oh , like a miata or something like that ? 
well , i like the miata , 
i would buy something , 
actually the car that i really like right now is an eagle talon , which is an american car . 
but , uh , something along that lines . 
uh , because i have an economy car right now , which is okay , 
that's interesting . 
i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for , you know , size and 
when i bought the car that i bought , i was looking for mileage , 
and i was looking for , uh , dependability and something that was going to last a long time . that was worth that money . 
i think in terms of computer terminology , i look at , you know , price performance and things like that . 
but it , you know 
but , you know 
that's right . 
and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton . 
it's , you know , 
we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles , 
uh , uh , i've had one or two american cars i think , 
and they were okay . 
i had a pontiac once 
and i never had a problem with it , 
but , uh , my mother had a dodge at one point 
and i had driven it a few times 
and i really did not feel that i would buy a dodge 
well , actually , i had uh , a dodge omni at one point 
 and that was , i think , what really prejudiced me against american cars because i did not feel that it was a very quality , uh , car . 
so , i guess you'd have to say , if i was looking , i would definitely be looking for a foreign car . 
that's interesting . 
it's hard to beat some of the , 
uh , like , i guess , in particular , we're looking at like a ninetyone corsica , uh , buy back at a , they say g m sponsored auction , 
but i think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that 
and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you , 
which is a good deal . 
because i guess , uh , 
i mean , well , ninetytwos , granted , but the new ones , you know 
fourteen to sixteen is what they go for 
so all the depreciation has been taken off 
and , the dealer comes out okay 
i don't know what kind of hit they take on it , 
but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it 
and  , 
i'm sure they did . 
we keep looking at that mini van . 
it's just , you know , 
we can get like a caravan 
 but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now . 
but , uh , uh , it's interesting , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
if , uh , it seems to be , 
well , julie , uh , are you in a situation where you'd soon need to deal with , uh , special care for elderly ? 
well , i don't know . 
my grandfather is ninetytwo years old . 
and he is still living by himself . 
my grandmother died a couple of years ago .
but he doesn't want to move away . 
he lives in a little farmhouse on a farm . 
and he recently had to have an operation 
but he just really doesn't want to go to a nursing home . 
is he able to , uh , still do everything himself pretty well ? 
well , he was until this operation . 
he has arthritis . 
oh , yeah . 
and now i don't really think he's doing that well . 
and a lot of my aunts and uncles live near him . 
and i have one aunt that really looks after him a lot . 
but , uh , my greatgrandfather was put in a nursing home when he was a hundred and three . 
and , uh , died six weeks after they put him in the home . 
and i'm sure that kind of thing would influence grandfather's feelings . 
because , uh , do they still have some of their life left . 
and i'm just here for the rest of the stay .
and so you know , it's more a case of where they are not able to look after their daytoday needs . 
they can look after a lot of things 
but there's some of the daytoday needs that they just are not able to deal with physically anymore . 
uh , i know none of my grandparents were in a nursing home . 
they generally were able to have someone care for them at home 
and they died .
but they were all , goodness , younger than your grandparents .
like they were in their eighties . that type of thing .
uh , but i did , uh , you know , i guess , 
uh , when i think nursing home i do think of people that are not able to take care of themselves physically . uh  , 
 but i just don't think that nursing homes really do a very good job . 
 and that's difficult part . 
because i think what they often get used as is , uh , almost like a very high level or longterm care uh , similar to a hospital . 
the care actually for the older people graded in four levels . 
and a level four type of care would be someone that really requires longterm hospital care . generally are not able to look after to a very great extent , physically .
often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease . ven though 
uh , but i think that it can be helpful in that , uh , it gets people the level of physical care they need . uh , 
but i don't , i mean 
at least , i mean i think some nursing homes do that . 
but i think a lot of nursing homes really , uh , are guilty of neglect . 
and i think it happens more in areas where it's , uh , where , uh , you know , there's government medical care and that kind of thing . 
if it's the lot where it's funded by the individuals 
and i guess that's sort of my lack of understanding . 
i think that a majority of the places in the u s , uh , you know , there is some government aid available , 
but the majority of it is to the availability of the individual to pay .
and , uh , if you're not able to look after yourself , then you have to rely , 
recently graduated from high school . meaning like , uh , you know , three or four years ago . 
i'm a senior in , uh , college now . 
and , uh , i can't really talk too much about the problems with , uh , public education in detail because the school system i went to was , uh , really superb even though it was a public school 
i feel that my , uh , 
i'm a junior in college now . 
 and i , 
i got a friend who goes there , by the way .
i want to talk to you about that afterward , 
uh , i've , 
the high school i went to uh , was a good one also . 
and well , i guess you could say one of the problems with the public education system is the disparity between different schools . 
because the one i went to was , you know , i'm sure a lot nicer than , you know , a lot of the inner city schools and 
it's a more or less a suburban school system ? 
that was true for mine too . 
uh , although i i'm sure to some extent , that money is part of the problem in the disparity , 
but i honestly don't think that's the biggest part of it . 
 you know , i 
what d , 
that's true . 
i mean 
 and i'm also 
 i mean , to quit school and get jobs and that kind of thing because they need the , you know , money to put food on the table and stuff like that . more than they would 
that's true . 
 , but , uh , i think , i mean even more than that , even , i mean if you drop out in high school 
that's true . 
now i think maybe it's started changing in the past few years because , uh , they have you have to take before you get 
uh , and that's just sort of inexcusable 
and you can't really , 
i mean i just can't even picture how that could happen .
but these people obviously weren't . 
that's hard for me to say since i didn't , 
well when i went to elementary school it wasn't in a great area 
but started learning to read when i was in kindergarten , you know . 
 so i guess i can't really 
you know , i guess the whole environment and attitude towards school and learning is different for the   people . 
and i think that's almost a bigger factor ,
i mean , i think you know , people just , 
 so , i guess uh , to get some kind of motivation to learn 
and , again , i don't , i mean 
they got to know you know , how qualified , i mean ,   
i think it'd be interesting 
i think that'd be an interesting experience . 
but , uh , i haven't done that .
i can't say that i have either . 
 but , uh , 
but i do think that , uh , i mean , public education in general i think can work . 
and i think it's a good thing . 
like , within the same , uh , income groups . 
if you compare you know , the people that , uh , did send their kids to private 
i think they compare you know , fairly well . 
i mean , i honestly don't really think i could have , you know , done much better than i did in the school system i was in .
my schools , i mean , there , 
i have a lot of 
once it seemed i got into high school , they had a lot of , uh ,   accelerated programs and all kinds of 
i mean , that makes a big difference 
cause i wondered when they're taking classes the subject and stuff like that . 
i mean , and in the , 
once you uh , start junior high , starting in eighth grade all the way through high school , there were four levels . 
well , no , 
i guess in junior high , it was still three . 
then in high school it changed into four levels uh , of instruction in the major subjects .
i mean , actually i think that works pretty well . 
  and that makes , 
how are you ? 
you want to go ahead and start talking about whether you budget  ? 
well i feel like , uh , i am from mars . 
i mean i'm fifty years old 
and , uh , i've been divorced for , um , eighteen years . 
but i've two kids and all . 
but i've never had a budget 
and i don't , uh , do any planning 
and i don't know , 
  uh , uh , i don't have a longterm financial plan . 
i don't try to control my expenses . 
but i'm glad you're a stranger . 
that sounds kind of like me . 
but , really , well i'm curious how other people live . 
uh , so maybe we should start with you .
what do you do ? 
about the same thing . 
maybe they're going to arrest us both . 
i'm even in worse shape because i have eight children 
and , uh , we live from hand to mouth .
we hope that there's enough money at the end of the month to pay for the bills and if there's not , then we   due for the next month . 
a couple of times we've tried some things 
and they worked 
but i'm not disciplined enough to keep doing it . 
the best program we ever had is at the beginning of the month we uh , took my check and divided it out into envelopes 
and when the envelope was empty  , then you didn't have any more money to spend in that area . 
and that worked out real well cause we didn't have to keep writing down what we'd spent . 
it was just that when that was empty , you knew you were out of money . 
and we did that pretty successfully for about three months 
and then we started borrowing from one envelope to put it in the other envelope 
and in about two months we were back to doing the same thing we always do . 
huh . the , uh , 
i had a parttime job around , oh gosh , fifteen years ago , seventysix , 
and , uh , uh , this was a sort of a career shift at the time 
and so i was willing to take a half time job to do that . 
and i actually did , 
my bank account would , uh , 
i kept bouncing checks , just at the end of the month 
but i had miscalculated . 
well i didn't keep a balance .
it's one of the problems .
i never had to in the past . 
i always kept plenty of money in my checking account , 
but when you're only earning half the salary . even though i wasn't spending much money , i sometimes would just , 
things would get to tight . 
uh , and sometimes what i would do is keep a piece of paper in my wallet 
and every time uh , i spent money , i mean cash mostly , i would , uh , write it down 
but i would forget to write the things down 
and in keeping that kind of data . 
i certainly haven't done that in sixteen years or whatever . 
i even find now like with the automatic tellers , i'll go take money out of that 
 and then i forget to take that out of my checking account . 
and , uh , 
so so the balance showing in the checking account is always somewhat different that what's really there . 
and i figure that gives me room for the mistakes i make . 
the , uh , 
i have to say that , 
let's see , at this point on , i don't run out of money . 
uh , and it , uh , 
and i don't , i mean 
someday , if i were to get remarried i might want to buy a house which requires lots of money which i don't have 
and is to not spend money . 
i mean i don't have expensive tastes . 
i don't go out . 
i mean i buy a car , 
well the last car i got rid of i'd had , 
it was nineteen years old . 
people were embarrassed for me . 
 i mean it was a good car 
 . but it was still running . 
oh , it was great . 
it was a sixtyfive buick 
and it just wouldn't stop . 
uh , and it , 
i just didn't feel the need for a new car . 
it isn't like i couldn't afford one . 
uh , and now , i mean i don't , uh , 
i tend to eat expensive food . 
i mean i don't mind buying a good steak 
but for me , i only do that every week or , 
i mean you buy a tenderloin steak , it costs outrageous , like twelve dollars a pound . 
you buy a , less than half a pound so it's six or seven dollars . 
to me , i realize if you have eight kids you're not going to run out and do that . 
that's a drop in the bucket . 
and so if you're extravagant on how you buy food , it doesn't add up . i mean if you're not going to super expensive restaurants , which i don't care to go to . 
that's right . 
i don't have to hold myself back from buying that expensive thing because i can't afford it , because i'm not interested in that expensive thing . 
a lot of , 
you want to go first ? .
uh , one of the things they talked about was , uh , what do we think about a judge making the decision ? 
and i really don't agree with that .
i think that the trial by jury is better , uh , you know , having a unanimous decision rather than to have one person be responsible . 
i don't think that they could be objective in every case , every time . 
you know what i mean ? 
this topic is kind of mute . uh 
there's no way . 
in a trial system without a jury . 
uh , one man , one woman can never be objectionable in every case . 
that's it . 
uh , every person has their opinions 
and that's why jury selection is often very difficult . uh . 
 well , i feel the other thing too , uh , 
they were saying , uh , you know , what new ways you know , change the system . 
i really think that , uh , we spend a lot of time , uh , going through appeal after appeal after appeal after appeal , 
i mean , if you go to a trial by jury and especially if a person has confessed . if they have been caught , you know , point blank in the crime .
it's beyond a reasonable doubt . 
you know , all these things . 
i mean , you know , 
they shouldn't allow an appeal . 
 and it can go on for ten , twenty ,
i think this is a little ridiculous . 
i think the only people who benefit from that are the lawyers . 
oh , that's right . 
i work for a law firm  .
i'm serious . 
and i think that the lawyers have caused a lot of the problems in the criminal system today . with plea bargaining . 
you know , if someone is ill , 
 well plea bargaining is a different story . 
plea bargaining is something completely different . 
that actually prevents trials . or at least speeds them up . 
 well , i know . 
that's   what i'm saying . 
but i think in that regard . 
i mean , you know , people who commit , uh , crimes that they , 
i don't know how it works exactly 
and i understand that the jails are full of people , you know , uh 
but , i think that the reason they are full is because they know that they can get away with it . 
you know what i'm saying ? 
that uh , well a lot of states don't have capital punishment . 
and , uh 
we do .
there's no doubt whatsoever . like drunk drivers that kill people 
and , uh , you know , all 
they're caught dead to rights . 
they've taken a life 
and they should pay for it with their life . 
when you're saying as far as the appeal , uh , procedure was concerned . 
we just have the case , 
i'm sure you've probably heard of marion berry . 
uh , his was denied two days before his sentence was up .
oh , really . 
so , i mean , his appeal was denied 
and two days later he got out of jail .
it , uh ,  , 
but , uh , .
there was no reason 
i know that  .
and , i don't know . 
uh , what would you do to change it ? to make it better ? 
well , uh , i wa , you know , 
the , appeal procedure is the only thing i can possibly think of . 
uh , like i said , as far as removing of the jury and having the judge sentence , that's absurd . 
there's no way that could work . 
 oh , yeah . 
i don't agree with that at all . 
uh , but , 
imagine the guilt that person would have . 
i mean   
 oh , exactly . 
if you had to do something like that , day after day . 
no one would want the job .
not really . 
 and , you know , like i said , you know , everyone has their opinions about every case . 
 well , do you think people should have a trial is they're caught dead to rights like , 
oh yeah . 
everyone is , uh , entitled to a trial by jury . 
that right s , 
 i mean , supposing i come up to you and i just point blank kill you . 
well , i mean , were there witnesses ? 
in other words you're saying that , you have to find out whether it's premeditated or 
that you can't remove the jury regardless of the case . 
i mean you could have fifty people in audience watching 
and there's still mitigating circumstances .
well , i , 
um , uh , basically a manhunt , um , 
and uh , it was called manhunter , actually . 
uh , and guts as possible . 
oh , how awful .
it was truly awful . 
it was not one that i picked , 
but , uh , uh , uh , some interesting things about the f b i 
because trying to get him were f b i people 
and , uh , uh , to develop , uh , uh , a mental picture of who they're looking for before they go out and do it and all the different ways they go about doing that . 
and the f b i and their procedures . 
i wonder how truthful all of that was or whether there was fiction . 
i imagine a lot of it had to be fictional just to keep the f b i , uh , going , i guess . 
well , they keep it rather secretive , 
well the most recent movie i saw , uh , i'm afraid was , uh , 
well two of them actually . 
uh , the rain man was one . 
oh that was great one . 
wasn't that fabulous , 
oh , i loved it . 
you know , i haven't seen that one yet , 
and i need to go see it . 
oh , you need to see that . 
that is the most heart rendering story of relationships between two people .
and this all took place in the south . 
oh my . 
and , uh , normally never the twain shall meet . 
you bet , especially in the south . 
and , um , uh , it really was a fantastic movie . 
the acting was phenomenal . 
oh yes , 
and , uh , 
oh yeah , 
that's right . 
it might have one best picture , too . 
it did , 
it did . 
just as rain man , uh , with dustin hoffman ,
that was , 
uh , of how to act from dustin hoffman , 
but , uh . 
uh , oh , much of the hype was that tom cruise learned so much from dustin hoffman . 
it must have been great just being with him for his lines and all that stuff . 
and a good bit of that was filmed right in cincinnati .
is the kmart there ? .
isn't there a kmart everywhere ? 
that was so funny , 
he had to , 
or was it kmart . 
he had to buy his underwear at kmart . 
that was hilarious . 
the , uh , the toothpicks , 
oh yes . 
and he was able to count the number of toothpicks just by a mental image . 
well , you know there are people , uh , referred to as savants also ,
and everyone feels they are totally retarded . 
wel , because that's the way they might seem outwardly , 
that's right . 
but , boy there's a lots going on in there .
it's amazing .
and of the disease ,
and then they balanced it with the wonderfulness of it , you know , 
then again work with it toward a good end .
and the , 
well the warmth that developed between them 
and again it , i think was a picture of relationships . 
again the relationship , uh , between the two , uh , that , uh , never would have occurred , uh , by accident . 
uh , i was so impressed with that movie 
i saw it three times . 
did you . 
uh , my personal background . 
that's older 
and , uh , he's not , you know , 
nothing , of course , serious is wrong with him 
of a relationship ,
and then , you know , uh , we get into , uh , uh , a really good relationship for a while and then , you know , back and forth 
so the relationship aspect of the movie between the brothers . 
that was neat . 
well that's tremendous , 
it's good because it does make you think , about your own family . 
a lot . 
and see it did bring out a lot of thoughts between you and your brother . 
no question , 
he's one of these guys though that doesn't really like to go see movies like that . 
he likes the bang them up and shoot them up things . 
to see it 
but , uh , oh boy . the best response that i've heard him give of this type of movie for rain man . 
i mean he certainly didn't , 
he only saw it one time , 
and he didn't go back for more , 
but , uh , he said he enjoyed it 
well he at least saw it one time .
and he really , 
i don't know , 
he's kind of a dustin hoffman fan anyway . 
but before he saw the movie he was like disappointed that dustin hoffman would do this .
just think of what a phenomenal actor dustin hoffman is . 
he will do that , to research it and to be able to mimic a person , uh , uh , with the kinds of problems that he had . 
and to make it believable . 
i mean i was believing it , 
i don't know about any body else 
but it was great . 
well , i'm sure everybody that saw it was believing it right along with them . 
he did great . 
well it's just , uh , been delightful talking with you . 
you take care up there 
and , uh , let's hear it for the summertime . 
i'm ready for it , 
but they're predicting some more snow for our direction . 
oh no . 
oh well , take care . 
take care now . 
bye , bye . 
bye , bye . 
where do you get most of your news ? 
i watch the macneil lehrer news hour , 
and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends . 
where are you ? 
i'm in dallas . 
oh , yeah . 
are you in dallas also ? 
oh , really , 
i get my news from a combination of sources . 
i take the paper every day 
 and i read it on the way in to work in a carpool . 
oh , really . 
uh , actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work . 
and then , you know , usually over lunch , there'll be a big topic of conversation on something 
i normally find that uh , i'm probably the most , um , news hungry of my friends , 
so we don't normally talk about the news at lunch . 
i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend , simply because i used to get it during the week 
 but , um , i would always end up arriving at work late , because i would always end up skimming the headlines , spending too much time ,
so i have to cut myself down to the weekend , plus after work . 
um , the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television 
 and i enjoy that quite a bit . 
um , one of the women that i work with , her husband is iranian . 
so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch . 
i will admit i work with , uh , someone who's iranian , 
and he definitely has a very different slant on the news . 
he's very , very skeptical of the news media , 
and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also . 
but much more so . 
it's sort of interesting though , because he does bring a much , um , different perspective with all the gulf goings on , um . 
he was always speaking in terms of , you know , american imperialism reasserting itself . 
um , i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country . 
well uh , i like the print news 
true , um , 
i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't . 
they , um , tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story . 
they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time . 
sort of like the , uh , what is that , a b c's nightline . 
well , i guess they only normally stick with just the one , um , story . 
but they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories . 
they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in every little town . 
it's very much national interest news . 
a lot of times they end up , um , with these panels of experts 
and they go back and forth , where everyone's giving some opinions 
and sometimes that , 
i don't know the value of that , because i saw plenty of jokes and , um , oh , editorial cartoons about all the retired generals ,
i've been getting a kick out of those lately . 
although , um .
i'm only twentyfive , 
so i've never actually been through a period of war 
 and i don't know anyone in the military 
and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in , uh , military strategy and all that kind of stuff . 
and i thought the generals were very interesting . 
now when they started to speculate , i saw that for what is was ,
but i thought they were interesting , 
and they shed some light on what was going on for me . 
i will admit it's interesting . 
i'm twentysix . 
so i don't have any more experience in that than you . 
um , it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind , you know , 
there were some that were screaming for air power , 
there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it . 
and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world , which i suppose just about everyone does , 
but these guys had and express this view . 
you know , one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c , 
and it was for children 
 and it was hosted by peter jennings , 
and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio , 
and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions . 
and and all . 
they had them all , uh , on , 
i don't know what you'd call it other than on line . 
they had them all on hold 
 and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer , they would cut to that person , 
and that person would answer the question . 
it was just very informative and interesting , 
and , uh , i was real impressed at how a b c handled , uh , translating ,
i didn't see anything like that , although i did , uh , 
i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting , 
this is getting a little off the topic , 
but there was a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors 
i thought that was a really unusual thing . 
and our local h e b stores here , 
i don't know if it's h e b statewide or whatever , 
but they have videos that , uh , 
i don't know if they still have them , 
but they were free rental ,
uh , it was , 
 with the children's aspect ? 
it was something for children , that they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and , uh , getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it 
i suppose that is a valuable service . 
again not having , uh , lived through another war , i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of , 
or if that was 
 uh , that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal . 
that's true . 
so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news . 
and probably more importantly , one that lasted short enough that people's interest didn't flag too badly . 
the first three days , i was glued to the television . 
i will admit the same thing . 
and i ,
and i , 
and they would run these extended two , three hour versions of the program 
 and i was horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing . 
uh , the war start , 
let's see , was it a wednesday or thursday ? 
must have been thursday , uh , 
and friday night i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning , sitting , right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open . 
because i was watching c n n , 
and they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus , 
and the people would be standing there in gas masks , 
and you'd be hearing the sirens , 
and it was just , 
i was amazed . 
i didn't have that experience . 
i don't have cable 
 so i thought they did a very good job . 
um , i've got one question for you . 
you say you take the newspaper . 
um , i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting . 
we've got the one well , relatively weaker paper , the times herald , and then the morning news , which has a very strong subscription . 
does san antonio ha , 
do you have just one paper , 
or do you have several ? 
there are two , 
and they're pretty close . 
uh , the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper , 
i grew up near houston 
 and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck , 
and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up . i mean , the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff . 
it's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over , 
and i enjoy , 
the comics are better in this newspaper . 
this newspaper has the far side and the comics that i enjoy 
and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of . 
i actually take both newspapers on the weekends . 
do you ? 
i figure i'm only taking on the weekend , 
and i can afford that . 
i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better , 
but i sort of have a liberal political slant , 
and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial , um , outlook . 
and my , 
i get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit . 
he takes both san antonio papers , an austin paper , both houston papers , 
i guess he takes seven , the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper , 
but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university , 
so he's getting all the sports sections . 
and , so , you know , he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread  . . . 
i guess don't really have a problem with capital punishment . 
i'm not really sure what the exact , uh , specifications are for texas . 
i know that they , uh , have capital punishment for certain crimes , 
and that's probably the way i feel about it is , uh , it kind of depends on the crime that's committed . 
my belief all my life , i guess , has been .
but i don't , 
seems to be a lot of controversy about that .
uh , uh , i tend to agree with you , uh , you know , 
probably pretty similar views on it , 
but is so much of the controversy 
because , uh , you know , i do also , myself , believe in capital punishment , uh , 
 uh , you know , you know , without even thinking or without any concern , uh , you know , end somebody else's life , and in a lot of cases several people's lives . 
i guess , well , of views as far as the controversy goes . 
i can see where  , uh , there may be cases where the death penalty is not called for , 
 but i lean towards ,
oh , yeah . 
that's kind of the way i feel . 
a three time loser for the twelfth time , you know , and he goes out and kills somebody , he's not going to be reformed , 
he's not going to get any better , you know , 
it's just not going to get any better . 
and the only thing , you know , 
a lot of people have the opinion don't have capital punishment , 
but give them life in jail 
and , you know , i could go along with that , if i could be assured that it would be their natural life in jail and not parole after ten ,
i think that's what aggravates a lot of people , is somebody does get a life sentence in place of the death penalty , 
and they wind up .
it's just i guess , overloaded , 
but the problem is not so much with the prison system , you know , 
i mean , because the cops are out there doing their job enforcing the laws , 
and the prison system are just , you know , 
they're trying to cope with them , 
but  , you know , the thing about capital punishment i , you know , 
a lot of people don't think it would be a deterrent , uh , to future crime , 
and the way it is now , it's not . 
 because , you know , you , 
if like 
the state of texas , for example , uh , you know , may execute somebody twice a year . 
you know , and many of them who have been there for literally for ten or fifteen years 
and that's certainly no kind of deterrent , 
and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that a deterrent , because it's not . 
it's not . 
you think of your chances of getting the death penalty after uh , committing a crime are really pretty slim right now . 
and you can ,
oh , yeah . 
and that's where a lot of aggravation comes , i think , is , uh , these guys spend so much time in the appeal process or just in the waiting process , 
they may spend years , 
and , you know , the last i heard it was costing ten , twenty , thirty thousand dollars a year , uh , 
it's amazing . 
uh , there's a girl i work with , our secretary , as a matter of fact , 
her father was murdered , her father and three other guys up here in sherman . 
and uh , the guy , that they tried and convicted and sentenced him to death , you know , he's been on death row for like eight years . 
and , you know , that got killed , you know , just coldblooded murder , him and three other people , 
this guy's sentence has not been carried out , you know , 
he's sitting on death row for eight years after having killed four people , 
and the state still can't bring itself execute , 
yeah , to carry it out . 
it sort of takes the justice out of the justice system . 
it does , 
it really does , you know . 
she , and they have to go back , uh , 
occasionally , you know , she has to write letters to the parole board and , you know , lawyers , 
and just ever so often she mentions , well , she's got to do something else , you know , write another letter ,
it's just , 
it should be over and done with . 
you know , she should be getting on with her life , you know , getting that part behind her , 
but yet , it's kind of tied to her the way it is now . 
it is . 
and she winds up being a victim ,
a victim , 
not only indirectly of the crime , but also indirectly by that ,
it's terrible , you know 
and , you know , like you say , the cops that are out doing the work  ,
oh , that , 
oh , man , for that very reason , you know , because they do . 
the criminal gets right back out 
and , you know , the cop's just got to go back are done by repeat offenders . 
they are . 
 well , that's about five minutes , 
so 
it's a pleasure talking with you . 
all right , 
ron , we'll see you later . 
tell me about your home . 
well , it's an older home . 
it was made back in the early sixties . 
it's a pier beam house . 
got three bedrooms , one bath and that just makes me scream . 
what area do you live in ? 
i live in houston . 
oh , okay . 
i see . 
is that pretty typical for your area ? 
well , for the neighborhood i'm in , 
yeah . 
this is one of the more established neighborhoods , 
that sounds real interesting . 
i live in a suburb of dallas 
and , uh , i live in the basic three bedroom , two bath home . 
so , at least , i have two bathrooms . 
that's not so bad , 
but , uh , it's pretty typical for the area , as well . 
uh , i've always been interested in older homes , personally . 
so , i think you can end up doing more with them , it seems like . 
what about yard space ? 
do you have a big lot , or anything like that ? 
the whole lot i'm sitting on is roughly half an acre . 
oh , i see . 
about half of that , about a quarter acre of that , i've got a garden . 
oh , that's nice . 
because i have just like you know , those basic tract houses , like that . 
we have a very small yard 
and , um , i do have garden , 
but it's extremely small , 
but , uh , it seems like , though , for your area that is sort of different . 
in a big city like that most houses , i would think , would be sort of like what we live in . just a you know , basic tract house . 
well , in the , uh , newer neighborhoods and development communities , the houses are so close together , 
if your neighbor is having an argument you can here it blow for blow . 
that's exactly right . 
that's the way we are . 
uh , one thing we have that we really enjoy here , is we have a hot tub in the back . 
so we have quite a few parties , 
and uh , seems like everyone that lives around us , ends up , you know , hearing every conversation that goes on outside with everyone . 
so , uh , that's true 
that is one thing that i don't enjoy about it , is the houses are too close together . 
but , uh , you know , it's fine for now , 
hopefully , eventually , we'll move in a larger home . 
the only thing that i don't like also is the rooms are so small . 
you know , it's very difficult to arrange furniture and things like that , 
are your rooms in your house bigger since it's a sixties home ? 
because it seems like then , that they built the homes much larger 
is that true ? 
and they've got better closet space . 
  new houses that i've seen . 
that's really it . 
that's a plus . 
at least we do have like three walkin closets here . 
so that's maybe not so typical , 
but , uh , 
it helps a bunch . 
it really does , except when you have to fill them up 
and then you get those visa bills in . 
and  , 
so anyway , um , anything else about , um , 
you know , can you compare yourself to any thing around there . 
most of the neighborhood i'm in is pretty typical . 
this whole neighborhood was built between sixty and sixtyfive . 
so it's , 
everybody has got a   , pretty good size yard , 
 i mean , i got probably the biggest , 
if not the biggest yard , i've got pretty close to it ,
that's nice . 
but , you know , too , the only bad thing , too , is that then you have to keep up , you know , 
you have to ,
 well , i , 
do you . 
you must have more time than i have . 
i'm sitting out here right now . 
we had this terrible rain 
and i'm looking at the yard and seeing how tall the grass has gotten 
and it seems like 
now that's , 
i almost wish i was in an apartment or something . you know , 
it's rained  .
do you know ? 
we can , 
well , can you tell me anything else about the house .
are you working on it ? 
i mean , do people around that area seem to do a lot of renovation ? 
that's nice . 
the town that i came from uh , is a , uh , older town , 
it like , 
the typical homes there are like , you know , early nineteen hundreds late eighteen hundreds , 
 and i renovated a house there 
and that was so much fun . 
i mean , there , if you don't live in a house that's at least seventyfive to hundred years old , you know , you're just nobody , practically .
and that was a good experience for me to learn a lot of discipline 
and , uh ,   was considered typical for that area . 
so , uh , it was quite a change for me to come to a house like that now that's just , you know , a very square little box 
and , you know , there's not a whole lot you can do with it . 
but , uh , anyway , 
living in the city has some advantages . 
that's true . 
if given the choice , i'm getting out . 
oh , really . 
well , i have lived in a small town for , you know , 
this town was like less than ten thousand people 
and it was about sixty miles south of dallas . 
and , you know , i didn't move out of there until i was , you know , twentyseven 
and that was just , you know , 
so i love the big city .
you know , i had lived in a rural area for so long 
so i've enjoyed it , 
but , uh , it can get kind of tough . 
its like a rat race sometimes . 
that's just something i'll never adapt to . 
i don't want to be a part of the rat race . 
i want to be basically just kind of left alone . 
if i want to sit around and mess with my garden , i'll mess with my garden , 
if i want to work in the flower beds , 
it sounds like you enjoy working outside as well . 
i really do enjoy that . 
but i haven't planted anything yet 
or , you know , i usually have gotten flowers coming out the gazoo , 
but i haven't done that , yet . 
i've had finals this week . 
so , uh , 
but , uh , since that's over with now , maybe i can get this yard in shape . 
do you do a lot of gardening ? 
uh , landscaping is more , than the gardening , 
in the garden i've got my beans , peas , 
i've got some onions out ,
i'm not real sure what they're going to do this year . 
i never have much luck with tomatoes . 
i do plant a lot of beans , because it seems like , the , uh , bugs get on them so easily 
and i have a real problem with anything like pesticides or anything like that , 
so , the only thing that i use is soap . 
i water , you know , spray the plants , because they say , supposedly , that will keep the bugs off them . 
but , uh , i don't have luck with that tomato plant , 
so i hate to spray them with anything . 
um , what do you do ? 
do you have any tips you could give me ? 
um , my favorite one is putting on the , um , tomato plant uh ,   dust , 
 and that stuff has been around since the beginning of time , 
that's true . 
my dad is a farmer 
so , i've heard him talk about that forever . 
i guess it works , 
but , um , you have to really wash your vegetables after that 
so it won't make you sick . 
let's see what else do you do to your house ? 
well , i've done some rewiring on it . 
eventually , if we stay here , i'm going to have to rewire the entire house . 
oh , really . 
do you plan on like adding any rooms or , 
you have enough space 
you could probably do that . 
or is it , 
i've talked about adding at least one more room and definitely adding another bath on . 
i would think so if you only have one bathroom for three bedrooms , 
that's tough . 
do you not , like , have a half bath . 
that's rough . 
the house that i used to live in had one bath and a half . 
and that was even just with two people . 
that was a pain . 
the only thing that saves it , with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works , we're getting ready to go to work at totally different times .
that's good . 
that could account for a lot of marital problems .
you get to know each other very well if you have to share a bathroom .
it doesn't work if you're trying to shave and she's trying to put her eyeliner on 
that's right . 
it does not make for a happy situation . 
that's true . 
well , do you have any children ? 
one child . 
and they enjoy where they're living ? 
he's nine months old . 
oh , so he doesn't know , right . 
i guess , he's a big help out in your garden . 
he likes to dig around a little bit . 
i guess he's enjoying himself . 
that's right . 
it's healthy , 
why not . 
he was eating the dirt , 
i wouldn't worry about it . 
it won't hurt them . 
i was a big dirt eater , supposedly , when i was a child 
and i turned out okay  , 
 so , don't worry about it . 
just let him enjoy himself .
well , that's what i've always , 
i was raised up in a town that was about ten thousand people . 
so you're just the opposite from me . 
you want to go back to that , uh , 
after we got married we ended up moving to the houston area . 
so are you from texas ? 
you are . 
so it's not , you know , 
that's true 
houston , in itself , is a pretty tough place . 
i'm back on . 
um , you say you watch evenings mostly ? 
i watch evenings because i work all day . 
i used to watch daytimes . 
um , mainly like all my children , that kind of thing . 
oh , so  . . . 
and then sometimes oprah and sometimes donahue , 
but now it's mainly evenings . 
do you have any that you like well enough that you tape them when you're not going to be there ? 
which ones ? 
i tape thirty something ,
those are the two i like the best . 
oh , two they're going to change . 
well , one they're taking , 
i know . 
it's going to be history , i know . 
i don't know what's going to ha , 
we like l a law . 
we don't watch thirty something , 
but that's kind of young for us . 
my husband and i are grandparents . 
oh , well . well  . . . 
so we don't watch , uh , that type of show , 
but we like l a law . 
we're just , 
i'm sorry they're breaking the team up , because we liked all the ones that were on there . 
i know . 
i'm amazed . 
i'm not sure i like the new ones too much . 
 you know , with all the funny things happening and different things . 
i just wonder if , uh , they just want to go on to other projects and not be stuck in this show , since it's gone on for so long , 
it looks like , 
i know . 
of course , i guess that's not bad . 
alan alda did it on mash . 
i know . 
isn't that funny ? 
it hasn't hurt him at all . 
so like a story type of thing that lasts an hour ? 
that's why i'm surprised i like those two shows , because usually i like , you know , stuff that just ends sort of , that you don't have to ,
in one hour , like quantum leap . 
i mean , you don't have to  . . . 
that's one of our favorites .
you don't have to have watched it last week in order to follow , 
which they do at the beginning of the season ,
that's always a bummer too . 
i know . 
sometimes it's better just to tape record both of them and then watch it all in one . 
we do that sometimes . 
i'm not into real heavy stuff . 
l a law is about the heaviest thing i watch . 
so i like things like golden girls or cheers 
or , uh , monday night is real good with me , you know , major dad and , uh , 
oh , what's that one with burt reynolds ? 
that type of show is what we 
we generally just stay on one channel for all of monday night , just to watch those . 
just some of the times they're continued , 
but mostly they're just little vignettes . 
a new one we found we really like is that dinosaurs . 
have you seen that ? 
it's really funny . 
they use like animated , 
it's not like a cartoon , 
but it's like dummies and things ,
and , uh , it's really , um , 
and robots probably . 
but there's always a moral to each story . 
and what night is it on ? 
well , we watched it , 
the times we've seen it , it's been like on or , excuse me , friday night . 
uh , but it's , 
we've only seen it a couple of times . 
but it's real , 
the first one we saw , um , person reaches seventyfive , 
and i can't remember what day they call it , 
but , uh , the soninlaws get to throw the motherinlaws when they're seventy five over a cliff .
 oh , great . 
anyway  , 
and the soninlaw and motherinlaw are sniping at each other and all , 
and then when it comes time for him to throw her over , well , the teenaged son the night before tried to save her by hiding her . 
you can't do , you know , 
he in a wheelchair to hide her , 
"this is tradition . 
this is what old people are supposed to be , thrown over the cliff ." 
what's going on . 
and so , 
oh , he doesn't . 
and , of course , the town thinks he's just terrible , because that has been tradition for hundreds of years and he's broken it . 
and then we saw one when a teenage boy comes into his manhood , 
they call it the night of the howling ,
and they all go out and howl , you know .
and the son refused to do it . 
he did , 
he thought it was not  . . . 
so he didn't go howl ? 
so all the people that worked with the father ostracized him .
oh , how funny . 
it is . 
it's real interesting to watch the show , 
is really now , 
so it's , 
that got us to watching it . 
but it really is , 
it's real short , 
and there's always , like i say , a moral to it 
it's just a half hour , 
or is it hour ? 
well , half hour . 
that's all there is to it . 
and , uh , they  . . . 
there's not many half hour shows , 
it seems like that , 
the father in there of the teenage son to like jackie gleason show .
and i guess maybe there are some parts of that , 
but i didn't really see that in there . 
but what i've read about it , they talk about that . 
but anyway , we've enjoyed that , 
i like the news shows too , the news magazines , like sixty minutes or twenty ,
i watch those if i , 
but my husband likes to watch , um , old movies , especially war movies , or , uh , sports , which i'm not , 
oh , see , i like sports . 
i don't . 
well , i like ice skating 
and i like , uh , gymnastics ,
but i , 
and i'll watch snippets of baseball games 
and i just don't have that much time to sit and watch the whole thing . 
and no matter what's on , i don't ever just sit and watch t v . 
i'm usually either doing dishes , 
or i may be sewing , 
or , you know , 
i know . 
or i may be working around in the room somehow , 
but i don't ever just sit and , 
that's something that comes from your old age , you know . 
i don't sit . 
idle hands are the devil's workshop .
i know . 
who has time ? 
i don't have time to sit , i know . 
it's , uh , 
that's why i don't get to watch that much . 
i mean , i ,
i do okay , because the kids are all in bed , 
but before that , there's not much time . 
or like at six thirty i'll watch wheel of fortune or something like that . 
well , our , 
they have to watch that . 
we don't watch it unless they're here .
i like that . 
i'll watch ,
 but they , uh , 
it's , um , oh , 
and , you know , the kids will get you started on stuff like america's funniest home videos . 
we've wound up sending in one . 
that's something i didn't think that we'd ever do .
did you send one ? 
how funny . 
and i mean , it got to the point he was eating a pear here , 
and he bit into it , 
and it was just hanging by a thread . 
and he walked around the house with his face down toward the floor and his mouth open , hoping it would fall out , because he wouldn't let anybody pull it . 
and he wound up pull , 
so do you have p c s ? 
i have a personal computer at home . 
it's an a t compatible . 
i don't use it very much any more . 
i used to use it quite a bit . 
i also have a p c at work that i use as a terminal . 
i do some p c stand alone work on it , 
and i can transfer data back and forth between the p c and the main frame . 
what about you ? 
do you own a computer ? 
um , well i sort of own a computer . 
we have two p c s at home , 
but neither one do we really own . um . 
are you leasing them ? 
loaners from work ? 
do you work for t i ? 
um , actually i'm doing consulting right now because i just had a baby , 
and my husband's working at bell labs , 
but he's really from france , 
and these computers actually are from france . 
what brand are they ? 
one of them's a compaq 
it's a three eightysix 
i'm jealous . 
 and the other is actually a i b m p c compatible , 
it's a three eightysix , 
i guess it's twentyfive , 
three eight six twentyfive c maybe 
i don't know , 
no we don't have the   , 
  we decided not to get the   which is actually another loaner one too that we picked up for a consulting job that my husband was doing  , 
what kind of consulting do you do ? 
um , well , i actually do some work , working at m i t and at nist , national institute of standards and technology 
and then i worked for dragon systems for a while . 
what kind of work do you do when you're consulting ? 
um , well , it depends , 
it's very different in the different places , 
is it programming related ? 
and i work in the speech field , 
and i do a lot metacoustic phonetics and 
and i do that type of stuff typically for other people , 
and like here we use the p c s to do that . 
mostly i use it for writing papers and things like that . 
word processing . 
well , more , uh , 
do you know latek ?
so i don't use , i mean , 
you can call it word processing , 
but i don't usually use a word processor to do it 
 and we don't have too much standard software . 
like we haven't really bought any commercially available software at all . 
so we don't use it for things like our accounts and addresses and things like that . 
we use it more for just writing programs when we need to or , um , doing research , looking at the speech signal and then doing writing , and also just as a terminal , 
and we connect to other computers to read our net mail and things like that . 
so , you've got a modem in it then . 
but we have a modem . 
at home 
neither one , 
uh , and so it's an external modem . 
when i got mine i had an internal modem in it 
i used it , uh , quite a bit when i was , uh , uh , looking at , uh , information on a large bulletin board sponsored by a newspaper in fort worth 
 but , uh , went out of town for a while , 
and sort of got off the , uh , bulletin board and off of my micro completely 
 and after a while the modem started making noises on its own uh , even without using it on the computer , 
i could turn a computer on , 
it'd start squawking . 
so i finally opened up the box and took it out . 
 so that was it . 
i think that's the thirty second warning . 
oh , i didn't hear it . 
do you hear , the beep in the background . 
oh , that's an ambulance or something going on here , i think . 
i haven't ever noticed the thirty second warning actually . 
and , uh , 
in manhattan . 
are you at home now ? 
so you've got a lot of traffic noise real close . 
so it'd be interesting for the people that look at this signal i mean , because there's a lot of background noise that , you know , people can hear . 
so it'll be interesting how much of it actually gets picked up . 
um , yeah , 
and often times that , 
i can't do this much later than now , between sort of like six , five thirty and six thirty or something like that , because the traffic outside , they honk the horn so loud i can't even hear the phone call . 
what time is it now where you are ? 
uh , about twenty after four . 
so you're an hour ahead of where i am . 
i'm in central 
we're eastern . 
and , um , did you ever try using like prodigy or any of those systems ? 
uh , i know someone who has , 
and she's , uh , very , uh , pleased with it . 
she told me some of the things you can do , 
and it's just a very handy tool to have . 
and you can do a l , 
it makes things very convenient . 
you can save a lot of money , too . certainly cut down on long distance charges if that's what you have in mind . 
i've never tried using that , 
i don't know too much about it . 
what about , 
did you use commercially available software 
i have used lotus . 
i have used , uh , word perfect 
 uh , i , 
not heavy use . 
i've used , uh , d base 
and , uh , i've used a substantial amount of shareware . 
um , i haven't done much lotus work connected with my job . 
i've been through three classes 
 and i have a great deal of respect for it . 
um , i haven't done much word processing work with my job . 
i do some 
 and i , 
and the d base work i've done was strictly class related . 
i've never used d base , um , 
but i've heard both good things and bad things about it . 
well , it's probably the granddaddy of most , uh , data base management systems . 
it's got some pretty strong competitors . 
some of them have reviews that are better than d base , 
so , i think by now , it's a matter of , uh , personal taste . 
people told me that it was sort of cumbersome to use . 
i can understand that very easily . 
i've had a class on , um , r base and also in paradox 
 and both of those seem very easy to use compared to d base . 
do you think d base is more flexible or allows you to do more . 
or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days ? 
um , i wouldn't say compatible , but 
but , uh 
i didn't mean compatible , 
i meant comparable . 
my brain is going to mush . 
and what do you work on at t i ? 
i'm a computer programmer 
i do , uh , mainly business data processing . 
i also handle production support for the systems in my area of responsibility . 
um , sometimes i get called late at night at home because there's a production problem , 
and that gives me the opportunity to , uh , come in to work and fix it , if i can't think of 
um , i also , uh , handle most of the calls from our users and other programmers who need to find out something connected , 
 um , well i guess first of all i could have asked that before . 
do you have children ? 
no . 
because i didn't know if that would make a difference 
um , what do you think about the proposal that all young americans should spend a year or two , 
i think it's a good idea . 
i think everybody the nation and for the good of themselves . 
i think it's , uh , 
would and realize what this country's all about . 
i just , um , 
i guess that's something that my family has always believed strongly in , 
and , uh , i had opportunities in high school ,
did you ? 
and i think it gives you a better perspective ,
and , uh , it gives you a little bit , uh , more a glimpse of the real world 
i think that's probably like , uh , quite a few things that the kids , uh , maybe not so much nowadays but used to 
they did things for people ,
well , i think sometimes through groups and organizations , um , 
and then , i wondered if people were unwilling 
but i think even if you went in with a negative attitude i don't think it would stay negative very long . 
um , but i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church 
that's probably true .
but , i think that's a small , uh , number could , 
but even through those groups , do you think that they participate as much as maybe they used to ? 
and that was something , uh , i think in the fifties and sixties , um , 
i think that's probably true . 
i think it's probably more true , still in the smaller communities 
uh , where abouts do you live ? 
what part of the country ? 
well , i live in richardson right now . which is just , 
 oh , okay . 
we're in plano 
 so we're not far apart . 
one of the calls i'd gotten before was , uh , down to austin 
and i know , a friend of mine talked to someone in the midwest 
so i know there is the possibility that 
i hadn't even thought about it being out of the area 
but you're right . 
i grew up in a real small town in florida . 
i mean a real small town .
and , uh , i think it was just   , 
of course it was back in the fifties 
and i think it was real prevalent back then . 
  , i think people thought more of others than they do now .
and uh , maybe this would be a way to get that feeling back . um , if we've lost some of that 
and it seems in the last decade or two , um , that's true , 
maybe that's a way , 
if young people had to do it 
i do to . 
i'm not sure that today's kids would go for it though . 
i think you would have to start younger . 
i don't know how young you'd have to go 
but i think by the time they're , oh , early teenagers anyway , i think it's too late now . at least around here . 
uh , i think it does help , um , even preschoolers , you know 
they're , um , things even just starting around the home .
little ones can do a little bit to help the family . 
and just watching the parents do things too , um , it can start a pattern . 
there's always something , no matter how young , 
and then that helps develop that attitude . 
um , i guess i would really like to see this happen with families more . 
you know , i think this is certainly a possible way , um , to handle it 
but i wish ,   
that's something that i think that has been lost in families 
and i think that's a good place to start again . 
i think it has to start in the families first because if you don't do it for your own immediate family , you're sure not going to do it for anybody else . 
and i do think , um , the schools , 
if you're trying to do something , even with food drives 
and , uh , sometimes what richardson and plano both , 
i mean when you live in areas like that where there's so much 
i mean , that's , uh , 
gosh i'm sure , not even one percent of the world is as fortunate as these areas 
 and , uh 
that's probably true . 
i know our church youth group , uh , starts with projects young 
but they have a high school group that works in the appalachia 
they've done this for fourteen years now . 
oh , that's great . 
um , and it's , uh , 
and they've also see that there's a different way of life and those families are really close . 
some of the things ,
 and , uh , it really , 
every youth that's ever gone really has felt that their life has been changed 
and it's changed their perspective . 
during the summer . 
so , if two weeks , uh , could have that kind of effect i would 
well , that's great . 
i'm glad that there are still some areas that get the youth involved in that sort of thing . 
well that's , 
like i said , i think it does , 
even a small amount of exposure can make a vast difference 
well  , 
well , i guess , um , 
did you have anything else ? 
i guess that's about all . 
okay . 
well , i enjoyed talking with you . 
well , good talking with you . 
and i hope you have a good evening . 
you too . 
have you ever had to put your children in , child care , mary dell ? 
 oh yes . 
i started back when it wasn't ,
my daughter that's seventeen now 
 and i had private care for both my daughters until they were two 
and then i was really lucky to have put them in a ,
 and it was a wonderful environment . 
i just wish all kids , if they have to be put in day school , could have that kind of place .
i see . 
 so , it worked well . 
how about you ? 
well , i have , uh , a nine year old and a six year old 
and neither one of them has ever been in 
 but , uh , they both went through preschool . 
and , uh , 
it's not hard to find anything that's parttime . 
so many of the churches have really strong 
like half day programs . 
 but , it was a nightmare back when cheryl was little 
and this is one of the few churches that did it . 
there were a couple downtown dallas 
but they seemed , 
i just couldn't hack it . 
and what i liked about preston hollow is that the people that were there when cheryl was two , which was fifteen years ago , many of them are still there today . 
so there 
she went back as a teenager 
and these people that had changed her diapers when she was three were still there . 
oh , my gosh . 
so , it was really neat . 
but it was because they had a director that had always done it as a labor of love 
 oh my goodness .
and i'm really glad my kids had it because plano schools do so little of that .
that is , uh , a big drawback i think in the , uh , public schools out here .
you're lucky to have an art teacher 
and if you do you get them once a week or something , you know . 
 or pay for it after school . 
our emily's in the third grade over at huffman 
and they started a pilot program where we can pay private tuition so that they can take french and music and art 
 oh is that right ? 
 i had no idea . 
this is something that ought to be in the schools 
 oh my goodness . 
 and with our budget cuts , i'm sure 
yeah , well , that's the only way they're going to be able to do it . 
and parents who really want their kids to have any humanities are going to have to do that . 
oh my goodness . 
 so , in some ways i think the day schools do serve those purposes . 
that's true . 
well even the preschools , you know they get so much of that in preschool 
and then when they hit kindergarten , you know , it's like wham .
it's just , 
put the colors away .
get the computers out 
which is too bad . 
 and , you know . 
that's hard . 
it's so difficult for them . 
um , did you have your children , did you say in , private care , 
was that in your home or in someone else's home ? 
until they were two . 
 so you were able to have somebody come there . 
 and that was hard too . 
i lucked out with really good people both times 
but i know so many people that are never able to find that 
and i'd practically give my paycheck away to do it , 
did you have a nanny 
or did you have someone 
well no , 
uh , the first one was an ,
 oh my goodness . 
 and she kept cheryl during the day and then did more babysitting at night . 
 and she was neat because she was like the grandmother that my kids never had 
so that was a plus from 
 oh gosh . 
and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend 
i have , uh , 
i just cannot fathom putting a little bitty baby in a commercial care center . 
i was just listening to a program this morning , 
oh well , i guess it was on the home show , 
but they were talking about , uh ,  , 
oh i can't even think of the name of it . 
i was halfway listening while i was painting .
um , it's some kind of advisory board they've put together for parents and children 
 and they've now moved it to washington , d c 
 oh that would be hard . 
you know , so , um , 
well , they give a lot more leave . 
i work at n c n b now , 
and our benefits for maternal and parental care and even for elderly people 
we have more options now then we did when my kids were born , 
with being able to take off fulltime longer 
 oh boy , that's great . 
it's really neat . 
i've had a couple of assistants that came back just three days a week 
or they've , you know , whatever schedule they want from a pay standpoint . 
we try to work it with their hours . 
and the bank has a lot of programs now for child care referrals . 
of course it's too late for me so 
god , it's amazing .
 and for our age group it's too late , too little , too late . 
but i do think it's an area that needs to be looked at and improved because more of us are going to have to work . 
two income families i think are here to stay . 
 well and i would think , you know , since big business is supposedly why the government makes the decisions they do 
 they have children . 
 so , it's only to their advantage that they get these programs going and 
oh sure . 
and , uh , 
you retain employees and keep them longer . 
that was the rationale they gave when they were giving us information about our 
so , i hope it helps . 
it seems to help the new mothers 
 oh that's good . 
 because that's hard . 
that's good to know . 
i have a couple of friends that ,
 and they 
usually , you know , you'll find a woman that's keeping like six children or 
and my future sisterinlaw's mother does that too , fulltime . 
 well in plano though the problem is , you find , 
and this is what i found with emily . 
from the time she started first grade , i wanted her out in plano area . 
and i kept finding neighbors and friends 
and they'd move . 
she ended up being in a different home every year . 
too transit . 
and i finally decided i didn't like that because it was traumatic to her to get so attached to a family and then have them move . 
and her surroundings . 
 so this year i tried kindercare 
well , let's see , 
well , we keep our glass and , uh , plastics 
and , uh , we make the dump over to the walmart bins there as soon as they're full . 
i guess we collect other plastics are acceptable . 
are you in the part of town where , uh , they have gotten into the other containers yet for recycling ? 
well , maybe they don't . 
i know that was supposed to be in may 
and i couldn't tell whether some parts of town had started it or if it was just everybody was waiting for the delivery of whatever those containers were . 
well , no , 
i haven't seen any , 
so had all been delayed several times . 
so i have no idea what they look like 
and , i'm 
i look at our big green containers , 
and i keep mine outside the garage so that i don't have any odors 
oh , right . 
it will be interesting to see how well that works 
and i'm glad the community is doing it . 
uh , it's one of those things that kind of has to be forced on people . 
uh , i don't know what you saw back , uh , years ago , 
but for me the thing that strikes me is uh , growing up in rural south dakota where , hey the farmers brought their eggs to town and the local hatchery 
and you got a nickel or dime , which in that time was a lot of money , when you returned them . 
pop bottles 
oh , of course . 
that , they did . 
you know actually , we had milk delivered to our house 
and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house . 
you could just leave the milkman a note 
and so you just put the empty ones back out there 
and he took them away and glass bottle in there . 
so , uh , yeah , 
so , uh , you know , i look back at , uh , my childhood 
and i'd say , you know , they were doing things then that we should be doing now 
and so it doesn't bother me at all that we're , uh , kind of starting to put the pressure on people to get away from all this , uh , throwaway society that got developed in the sixties and seventies . 
it would be nice to see it take a good turn here . 
it seems like it started to take a turn and then it went away 
so i hope that this time it stays . 
so , uh , you know , actually when we go dump our things , oh , we collect newspapers , too , and then take them , 
seems like pretty continual flow of people coming and dumping glass and dumping plastics 
 so that's kind of encouraging . 
you know , i didn't know if we started to do that . 
i didn't know what to expect . 
well i'll have to say i'm , the only one i'm good at at this point is the newspaper . uh , taking that to the boy scouts and my aluminum cans 
but on the plastic , uh , i don't have any habits there yet 
and to push me in that direction 
 well , i guess they will shortly . 
i , uh , 
and i think 
because i remember searching ditches for beer bottles because they were worth money 
oh , right . 
 and it seems like beer drinkers are among the worst for throwing things out the window 
and so outside my little town ,
do you know , uh , the small coke bottles . 
and i don't know if there's a deposit on those or not . 
well that's interesting because , 
well , let's see , 
they'd be , i don't know , maybe ten ounce or 
and they were packed in the old sort of six pack stick them down , you know , uh 
the carton . 
so , i hadn't seen that in a long time . 
well , i mean the , 
you really look and say a lot of the things we need to do , we were doing 
and we had all the mechanisms in place with the fold up paper cartons , the wood  , uh , racks which now , basically , you could turn them into the plastic ones that would hold , uh , twentyfour bottles . 
and , uh , uh , i'm not really say going back to good old days , 
but certainly we were doing things the way we think we should do them now . 
well , it will be interesting to see how , over the next year , this all works out because , like on the , uh , grass , i know your husband , uh , doesn't really like the paper sacks . 
he doesn't like the paper sacks 
but , you know , he likes to pick the grass up , too . 
he doesn't , 
i'm the same way because otherwise , uh , 
but i don't believe in throwing it into uh , the landfill , 
so i have my compost pile , 
but most of us don't have the , uh , sufficient ,
uh , so i'm glad the city's willing to take that on . 
that's nice . 
i guess they dump it the same place , 
i wonder where they dump that . 
well , there's someplace , you know , 
if it's , 
because really , when i look at what my grass does in actually about twentyfour hours , uh , knowing what the farmers do in rural areas , they just take their hay and just build a big mound of it and it naturally , uh , composts or stores 
and , uh , so all you have to do is just place it somewhere and churn it 
and it will naturally decompose  , uh , 
so you just have to kind of keep in separated 
and then , uh , who knows how they process it from there and what they turn it into , 
but it's certainly usable material . 
well they must keep it separate if they have this date in . 
they have this day now , that it's , you know , separate from the other trash pick up . 
but , the thing i don't understand about that is , like when , 
it's one thing to send grass there , 
but i've trimmed trees and other things which , uh , end up being something that , clearly won't decompose nearly as rapidly , 
what kind of music do you like ? 
i was thinking about it for a long time , 
and i like basically almost every form of music and type of music . 
um , i don't have a whole lot of dislikes . 
i , um , like jazz , um , especially the blues , 
and , uh , i like , uh , a lot of and beethoven and chopin and , um , just in general everything . 
um , i enjoy , uh , a lot of the modern forms , um , uh , 
do you like , like rock and those kind of things 
uh , well , 
some of the punk , um , when i was in high school , that was , uh , one of the big things , was punk music , 
and , uh , the lyrics do , 
but the actual , 
i don't think they have a whole lot to say , even .
uh , well , of the people who enjoy the music 
 um , but as far as a musical art form , i just don't see a whole lot of art to it .
do you like rap ? 
um , some of it , um , 
it depends . 
the rap that is just funny , um , 
and they usually do a lot of satire 
that kind i kind of like . 
some of it is kind of 
the monotonous 
that's not , 
i don't like 
i like the funny , satire , 
and then in 
it really does . 
it talks about , um , race relations and police relations 
and , um , that 
i guess i don't really care to listen to rap that much except for once in a while some of the funny 
um , i'm , with you though , 
i like classical 
 um , i don't like to listen to it all the time , but , um , some of the time , anyway . 
i like easy listening , just kind of , you know , 
i guess i don't care much for rock and roll any more . 
i used to like it all right , 
but i don't really care to listen to it any more for some reason . 
um , let's see . 
country western , uh , i'm not quite as big on that . 
some of it's okay , uh 
that's about my opinion of that .
it's okay , um , 
some of it kind of falls in the rap category i guess , 
um . the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is , doesn't seem to be any imagination behind it 
 one country and western song sounds like every other ,
a lot of them ,
 and so the musicians don't get to really get into their music . 
they just play a certain number of chords 
the drummer plays a certain beat , 
and you have a country and western song 
well , that's kind of the way i feel about rock and roll sometimes , too , i guess . 
they don't really , 
has kind of the same sound over and over , 
and the other thing i don't like about it is they have a tendency to play the instrumental so loud that you can't understand what the lyrics are 
you can't understand what they're saying on some of those songs 
and i can't say that i like a lot of very 
but some of the seventies 
earlier things . 
 and , uh , i really enjoy , especially the sixties  . . . 
my name is leslie . 
i'm jennifer . 
and where are you from ? 
oh , nice , 
i'm from dallas , texas . 
oh , really ? 
oh , that's neat . 
well , did you understand you know , what it was for , what we , 
uh , television shows ? 
that sounds good . 
i don't watch too many , 
but we can try it . 
are you ready to start ? 
just a minute .
i guess we're recording now . 
what are your favorite television shows ? 
well , i don't really watch too many t v shows other than , uh , occasionally i'll turn on donahue because it comes on in the morning when i seem to be getting ready around here . 
oh , really ? 
for the conversation factor , i think , 
and then i think i enjoy when i catch it , i don't even know what night it's on , but designing women sometimes , 
oh , i love that show . 
do you ? .
it's fun . 
and then there's a new one that started out that i've caught a couple of times called good and evil , i think . 
oh , i heard they just canceled that . 
oh , really ? 
i read in today's paper they just canceled that show . 
it is a real different one . 
it's different . 
i guess i watch it more out of the uniqueness of it and the time that it comes on more than the fact that i have to see it . 
have you seen the show , it's new this year , called home front ? 
oh , it's really good . 
uh , i think it's on like tuesday nights from ten to eleven 
 and it's set in post world war two times 
and it's about how the servicemen come home and readjust to civilian life here and the changes everyone's going through . 
it's really interesting . 
oh , yeah . 
it's kind of like a nighttime soap opera type thing . 
sounds neat . 
it's really well written . 
is that on , what station ? 
oh , okay . 
what other shows do you like ? 
uh , i prefer oprah winfrey 
oh , yeah . 
well , she comes on later 
and i usually have kids around so i don't end up 
i did watch soap operas , 
but i work fulltime now and can't catch those anymore .
that's right .
they're stupid .
so when i did watch them i was addicted to them every day . 
but not anymore . 
that can happen . 
so do you know of any other shows in the even , or something that you enjoy ? 
oh , uh , tonight i'm looking forward to seeing golden girls . 
oh , that's always fun . 
i like that show . 
and if i can stay up late enough , i like to catch saturday night live every now and then . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and right now we're watching a penn state football game because that's where we live . 
oh , yeah . 
so  , 
it's exciting , 
we're winning , 
so that's really exciting . 
well , i think , 
i also , course , like to catch the news during the evening hours 
 but , uh , it's a little tough because that's when i'm usually making dinner and the kids are wanting to talk all at the same time . 
so , usually i don't get a whole lot of news watching in . 
we watch c n n in morning while we're getting ready 
we'll catch our news that way . 
watch the weather channel so that we know what the weather's going to be like . 
so what have you seen interesting on oprah winfrey lately ? 
lately , i haven't been catching it because of my work schedule . 
uh , i can't remember the last time i saw it . 
it's been a while . 
i don't know , 
sometimes they come on and say . 
oh , that's right . 
well , today on c n n they were talking about something like this about , uh , learning to recognize voices and words and stuff and the research that's going on which is kind of what we're doing , helping them get a data base for words . 
um , yeah . 
it was really interesting . 
it is interesting . 
do you work for texas instruments ? 
oh , that's nice . 
so it kind of makes it easy , you know , to do a little something for it . 
because uh , we've talked to a lot of people from texas , it seems , 
i think that gets us off to discussing the topic for tonight . 
which is movies , 
are you a movie buff ? 
um , yeah . 
but outside of that , rent a lot , 
watch them on t v mostly . 
well , i have a v c r 
and i see most all of mine there . 
what have you seen recently that you enjoyed ? 
uh , i don't know , um , 
actually earlier tonight we were watching to live and die in l a . 
have you seen that movie ? 
it's a kind of one of those psycho ones . 
now , i live alone . 
consequently , i don't like these psycho things . 
 oh , it's not too bad . 
one of those cop thrillers 
oh , okay . 
have you seen the mov , 
do you have a v c r ? 
have you seen the movie class action with gene hackman ? 
uh , no , 
i saw it this weekend 
and it is , uh , to me an outstanding movie . 
i thoroughly enjoyed it . 
he is , uh , an attorney and his daughter is an attorney 
and she has a suit against his company . 
you know , it's one of those things . 
 but there's a lot of l , 
well , it's something that anyone can watch and enjoy . 
he's a good actor though . 
beg your pardon ? 
um , gene hackman's a good actor .
he is . 
do you see hoosiers ? 
saw it just again the other night , for , 
actually we saw her just the other night too . 
oh , did you ? 
it's one of our favorite movies . 
i live with , um , a roommate and my girlfriend the three of us . 
we've seen that movie probably six times in the last six months . 
have you seen the movie , um , crossing delancy ? 
now , that's one i have watched , oh , six or eight times . 
i always feel so good when i get through with that movie . 
i like those movies that you watch time and time again . 
i do too . 
dirty dancing and crossing delancy are two of my favorite . 
so , well what business are you in ? 
i'm an electrical engineer . 
in new hampshire . 
all right . 
i work in massachusetts actually . 
oh , all right . 
so is everything going all right up there ? 
um , it's only about , um , half an hour . 
i live on the border . 
oh , well that's that bad then . 
half an hour , we do that just going to downtown dallas . 
that's right . 
see we live up in tax free new hampshire and drive down to massachusetts to work . 
but , um , we , 
are you a native of that part of the country ? 
it seems , southern town , 
it's called portsmouth . 
we live right in the corner . 
that one little spot in new hampshire , we have ten miles of coastline , 
i live on that little ten mile spot . 
uh , sounds wonderful . 
did you have damage this year with hurricanes ? 
but further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad . 
i happened to be in nassau 
and we got the backlash of that thing . 
and they had record high waves , thirty year high waves come in there , 
and it was quite an experience 
well , what movies are you looking forward to seeing now ? 
um , well , i'm only twentyseven years old 
so the doors movie , that's out on video . i want to watch that . 
have you seen green card ? 
that would be pretty good . 
that's a real warm movie . 
it really just turned out nicely . 
so i would recommend that if you have a chance . 
i'm in for it . 
we rent a lot of movies 
and we don't know . 
 well if you can get green card , go for it . 
all right , 
we'll try that one . 
i have been working uh , as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas 
and i have watched , uh , gross anatomy . 
have you seen that one ? 
and i don't know 
i can associate with some of the people in that movie because of the young students i see over at the medical school . 
but i hope you have a very merry christmas . 
you too . 
i'm looking forward to it . 
i think we're going to have a white christmas up here just like the song says . 
uh , well , uh , to begin , 
i guess , uh , space is , uh , real important , i think , 
so it's real vital to the future of not only our kids but every generation until the end of time , i guess . 
i agree 
it's definitely new frontier stuff . 
so , uh , 
but , uh , i'm not too uptodate on the space frontier , 
but , uh , i guess they're going pretty far into it now . 
um , star wars is not too far i don't think . 
but , uh , 
i worked on some of it at t i 
oh , have you . 
so what do you know about it . 
well , actually i'm quite versed lately . 
i get on a computer network all the time , 
and people are talking about the current space program all the time . 
they're talking about new rockets that they're designing now that , you know , are just like science fiction , you know , 
it's like they ,
and then they land , with the , you know , 
the afterburners are going , you know , not like space shuttle landing , you know , gliding down , but 
oh , my gosh . 
it's called v c x or something like that . 
also called delta clipper , which is a decent name for 
well , i don't know . 
you think you'd , uh , go up in space if you had a chance ? 
oh , yeah 
do you , 
i think that'd be neat . 
i think i would just sitting here talking about it , 
but if the time came , it'd be real nervous . 
i'd be scared , 
scared me worse than six flags roller coaster . 
that'd be pretty hairy . 
well , you know , i had uh , uh , a tire come off of a car , 
so you know , like i know what it's like to  , 
depending on what was left of my technology to get me home .
so , well , i guess they're talking about people going to the moon and stuff , now , wherever .
they're talking about doing that again , too . 
i don't know if we'll ever see that up there . 
well at least we're going to have a space station supposedly in the next few years . 
oh , really . 
that's all beyond my imagination really . 
but , science fiction books , 
i mean , you look at the jetsons , you know , cartoon show , and it's not too far fetched what they all had in those cartoons , 
so you never know . 
oh , yeah , 
any of that stuff from the jetsons , from that cartoon , that you would never imagine would we have a lot of those , 
so you never know what may occur , 
i don't know , 
but i think it's real vital important for the future , you know 
i , uh , 
it's something definitely that , uh , you know , 
it's , uh , got the extra little oomph of interest . 
i'm sure it'll draw a lot more interest too , once you know , like it's more possible , 
i wish , uh , 
like , uh , boeing or 
 and they'd go up , you know , and do things 
so did they scratch the "they" in this sentence should probably be a "the"+
but i don't know whether , research will go on . 
but the economy the way it is all over , they probably cut back on 
oh , yeah . 
well , they're going to be cutting back so much on just , you know , the number of troops we've got in europe and the number 
i know , 
and then , 
but , uh , russia's still going to have missiles , 
they're still going to be subs and things . 
and we don't know who's handling them now 
 so that's a whole different story now . 
latest i heard it was just going to be russia itself that was going to have them . 
oh , really . 
at least you know , that's what everybody says . 
oh , yeah , 
we want only russia to have them . 
you're a republic , 
you don't want those , 
you don't want those .  .
some crazy hit man over there so , 
they splitting it all up now , 
and one of them crazy 
you never know . 
pretty much . 
one hopes . 
i think we went through him though to get to gorbachev on a lot of subjects 
but that way , you can't never tell that . 
kiss some butt , 
well , michael , what do you think about , uh , funding for aids research ? 
do you , 
well , uh , uh , that's something i've thought a lot about . 
uh , i work in a hospital . 
and i've worked in the hospital for fifteen years 
and i've taken care of a few aids patients . 
uh , when they asked us did we want to , uh , keep it the same or , uh , spend more , spend less , i think 
i don't think it's going to be that easy to come up with 
 or i think they already would have by now , you know . 
if spending a lot more money would really make any difference right now . 
i think they're doing as much research as they can possibly do , you know . 
and , uh , what about you ? 
well , i guess i'm not too aware of how much they're spending right now .
i'm not either . 
i'm definitely not aware of how much . 
uh , that's something i've never really kept up with at all . 
uh , i don't , 
 i mean , i , 
go ahead . 
i know , uh , i've always thought more about the disease rather than the research , 
you know what i mean ? 
and , uh , that sort of thing . 
uh , if we were talking about the money , uh , i'd just have to say what they're spending is probably enough , simply because i don't know that much about it .
i mean , i can see that research is needed 
and , you know , 
oh , yeah . 
i think so , 
 i mean it's becoming a major problem . 
but , uh . 
well , that's true . 
that's true 
and i , 
it's definitely not . 
and  , 
that's true , 
and , knowing , you know , 
myself , uh , uh , i'm or about to , get a divorce 
 and , uh , course , i'm not all ready to just run out there and start dating everybody i can or anything . 
but , it's sort of scary to find yourself single again , you know . 
and , uh , because you never know what's going to happen .
you don't know who you're going to come across , you know . 
course , i'm not going to want to go and have sex with everybody i see . 
but it's something you got to think about these days . 
a single person .
and , uh , i mean , it certainly changed my attitude about that 
and , uh , 
i think for a lot of people it has . 
but , uh , uh , i know that , uh , in some of these larger cities they're passing out free syringes and all of that sort of thing 
and , uh , i don't know , 
i don't think that's a bad idea . 
i know it , uh , sort of doesn't address the problem of drug addiction .
it just sort of keeps that going . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
at least drug addiction can be treated whereas aids , so far , cannot be .
so , i don't know , 
i think that's , 
i'm not too the passing out of the free syringes myself . 
i don't know , 
what do you think about that ? 
well , yeah , 
they gave us a hard topic .
i mean , i definitely think that it's the drug problem that needs to be addressed , 
but as you say , uh , people , i mean , in the meantime , 
that's true . 
if they're perpetrating the aids problem , passing that on to each other , then 
 you know , i guess if you consider the two problems , drug addiction and aids 
so i don't know . 
uh , course , there's so many things in the world where , if you solve one problem , you may be creating another  , you know . 
uh , so i guess you just have to take the two problems and see which is worse .
i don't know . 
uh , but i've never looked into how much money they're spending . 
i have no idea . 
and i know a lot of our tax money goes to that . 
but , uh , i really have never looked into it . 
i have no idea . 
i haven't either . 
i've heard , you know , uh 
so i don't know , 
and , yet , i know uh , it sounds like big money to me .
but it 
i think it is . 
it does every , 
it seems to take more than , uh , for any little thing they do , 
it seems to take a lot more money that you would think it would .
but , uh , 
did you have any fear working in the hospital with that , 
uh , uh , i , 
a lot of some of those conditions , 
but , uh 
uh , i work in the operating room a lot 
 uh , and , of course , when w , 
how you doing ? 
i'm lee with , uh , uh , 
i'm over here in plano , texas . 
let me ask you something , can i run a minute and shut my radio off ? 
where are you calling from 
arlington . 
well , there's a lot of stuff going on in arlington these days . 
not all good stuff . 
are you involved in any of that ? 
no . 
what benefits do , 
now , do you work ? 
i'm going to school right now . 
oh , you are ? 
i've got a lot of , 
because i work for myself 
 and so , uh , there's a lot that i guess i do miss , uh , a lot of benefits from working for a big corporation . 
i miss , uh 
but , uh , 
i've been in my own business , mary kay , in fact , 
i'm selling in out now to go to school full time 
oh , is that right ? 
go to work when i wanted to or not 
 but , you know , the benefits weren't there . 
uh , i own part of a roofing company . 
oh , do you ? 
in the dallas , fort worth area . 
and , uh , you know , unfortunately bigger company 
 and we had all the benefits there 
and i do miss that .
but , uh , on the other hand , the time 
i think today the thing that i , uh , would appreciate the most , 
uh , because my husband gets ,
but we have 
and i'm the only one that's being insured 
oh , is that right ? 
so it's kind of , 
and i would , 
i really , 
and the way medical expenses are 
that is the single most 
because i looked into picking up some , uh , medical insurance 
and it is unbelievable 
it's out of sight . 
it's out of sight . 
and , uh , yeah , 
even at a group rate , i couldn't believe how much 
oh , yeah 
even at a group rate . 
uh , it's unbelievable 
and , uh , the amount that you have to pay you know , for kids 
and if you want to add dental to it , i mean , that's 
it goes up . 
so , yeah , 
i guess 
 uh , you know , i feel bad for the people that are involved in that , uh , g m deal there in 
and i'm sure it will be , you know , quite a few people are affected by that 
it's going to hurt the city , 
although , uh , i will personally tell you , i used to work at a bank , 
and i would see the g m people come in when they would shut down to retool . 
they were paid that whole time 
and i don't know , if you're aware of this r , 
oh , really ? 
just , they go off fishing and stuff and come in every friday , and go to the safety deposit box , 
and i'm sitting there making a hundred dollars a week , you know 
is that right ? 
i really believe they have done this to themselves , in a way , because of the unions being so stocked . 
the union , 
and right now , anybody's that's laid off from g m will have a full year's paycheck . 
i just read this in the paper the other day . 
is that right ? 
plus probably an additional six months through uh , through the company 
so you know , i'm sorry it's happening 
but i don't feel as sorry for them , 
if my husband 
 really the , 
and that would be it . 
really the ones it's going to hurt the businesses around 
oh , yeah , 
that's already 
you know , that's the ones that 
but i think there's a case ,
they voted them in 
and they got so good , i mean , like two dollars for a prescription 
oh , yeah . 
 and it made the prices of cars go up 
i believe in unions , 
but they went too far . 
well , i'll tell you , i 
i mean , i can't make eighteen dollars an hour . 
mean , i know someone out here that makes eighteen dollars an hour . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , do you want to go ahead 
uh , .  , uh , went to school at madison for two years 
and they are really big on women's rights .
and so i've seen a lot of like rallies and things like that . 
but , uh , i'm not that liberated . 
i mean my mom is kind of oldfashioned , you know . 
so , you know , you pick up some traits from her and stuff . 
but , uh , more of them doing men's fields . 
i like to see that . 
but , you know , i believe in like sharing and doing things for each other . 
i do too . 
i like the idea . 
i see a lot more , uh , 
my children , i have five children 
and they're all married . 
and , uh , i love seeing the men help the women so much . 
and they both cooperate together on , 
i think it's great . 
oh , me too .
i hope that happens to me someday . 
i mean , i don't mind 
uh , i have a boyfriend 
and i got to make him dinner and stuff 
but , you know , he'll help me do the dishes . 
i don't want to , you know 
that's right . 
i've always taught my men that . 
they better clean up with their women and help them . 
if they did that , you know . 
and they're good about it . 
but it is neat to see them all work together . 
they stay at work or go back to work . or whatever . 
and they're well educated . 
and i believe we'll see a lot more c e o s in companies . 
they're having a fit about how little there are . 
oh , yeah . 
i think it'll escalate . 
uh , and i think black women now 
in fact i work at a high school . 
and boss is a black woman and has only been there a couple of months and already promoted 
and she's very sharp . 
and i think that th , 
and the ethnic thing you know , is a good thing now . 
oh , me too . 
they're moving them up 
and they're sharp 
and they , 
so you're going to see a lot more of that in leadership i believe . 
i like to see that . 
i think it's , uh , really neat to see and all that educated minority , uh , person 
that's a shame . 
especially black women . 
but they wouldn't know what they're doing . 
but i'm not big on subserving as far as 
 but i never have gone along with that , you know . even far back . 
but i was brought up pretty good in a home that , 
years ago my mother was that way . 
the same . 
my bo , 
ther , you know , 
but we never were taught , 
they had to do as much as we did . 
so that was good . 
same here . 
so uh , necessarily by sex type thing .
same here . 
you should be able to accomplish as much . 
and i think the , uh , attitude is a lot better towards the parents raising the younger ones now . 
i see more men , uh , like participating in like the family things with children .
what about politics on it ? 
do you think the political scene ? 
i'm not that big on politics . 
i'm not 
i'm kind of disgusted this year because i don't see many women into the political scene 
and i really think we should have more 
oh , yeah . 
i agree with that . 
there's nobody again . 
i think they're all scared out 
oh , what was the lady's name that ran a couple of , 
i forget her name now . 
oh , i don't know .
 but you know who i mean ? 
she took such a rough go of it . 
and their tax deal and , 
at least she was strong to like try it and you know . 
 so that's good . 
 but i wish they would get some more on that . 
i really was disappointed this year when i see any of the candidates talking that they're talking about . 
uh , i didn't see any of the women in there . 
and that disappoints me . 
and right now i don't think we have too many . uh , in the forefront . 
schroeder's about the biggest one in washington . 
congress woman . 
and , uh , other th , uh , 
we really , 
i have written this down 
so it would , 
do you think it's possible to have honesty in government or an honest government ? 
you're asking what my opinion about ,
well , i suspect that it is possible . 
uh , i think it probably is more likely if you have a small government unit where everybody knows everybody . 
that's a good point . 
but , uh , other than that i think maybe it just depends on how you define honesty . 
you know , that's interesting . 
i had read something one time 
and it was just applying to governments in general , 
it was written many years ago . 
it said that it's impossible to have a completely honest system of government because people who choose government for their positions are power seekers . 
and i thought that was interesting . 
it wasn't just talking about our government . 
it was just government in general . from times past , you know 
so they're saying that government officials would tend to be power seekers . 
and that would be a next question to ask . 
or are they in there for their own gains , 
and personally i feel there's probably some of each . 
but i think maybe a lot of them , um , 
 and , you know , how good a name can i make for myself and so forth . 
so i guess it would be like anything else . 
the president of general motors probably has the same , 
oh , yeah . 
and they talked , uh , 
the other , let's see . 
then they , 
that's hard to answ , 
but i agree with you , there's a lot in business . 
i think that's very normal ,
i think we put too much on politicians . 
we expect them to only be there to serve us , you know . 
if you knew what you were getting when you voted , uh , 
it's interesting 
because i'm taking a texas government class right now , 
and one of the things   
it's so easy to blame them to   
a lot of times i think it's our own fault . 
they lie to us because we don't want to hear the truth . 
they say you , 
 and it , 
if they tell us the truth , we don't  elect  them 
and i don't know why anybody would want to get under that scrutiny anymore . 
it's hard to imagine . 
because it's , 
we're not talking about issues we're talking about somebody's personal life 
 and we're getting away from what we ought to be looking at .
and it almost seems like in order to avoid , uh , some of the scandal , you would have to have the kind of wife that you would only find , say in the  bobsy  twins or ,
you know , i also think it would be funny if we could know everything about the people that were in there and throw them out . 
i don't think there would be too many  left  .
 so you're taking a government course ? 
at what ? 
the university ? 
uh , at , uh , it's t c j c . 
tarrant county junior college . 
and it's really enjoyable . 
i like it . 
and i don't think we can make laws to eliminate anything anyplace totally . 
you can make laws against corruption .
but that , 
i don't think making laws will stop it . 
i mean i don't know how many laws you would have to have . 
i mean , 
so no , 
i think you can legislate 
but i think there's no way that you eliminate it all by legislating , 
and we would end up with so many more laws that , you know , 
i mean i just think that's human nature that you're going to have corruption in government , in business , personal life , i mean , you know . 
actually , i think other countries may have it worse , uh , 
the japanese government is always having some kind of a scandal . 
usually involving the prime minister or people very close to him . 
so , uh , 
i still believe i get very fed up with government sometimes 
but when i think about where i'd want to go , you know , this is still the best 
or i can , 
i've been around to a few other countries 
and i have not found one yet that i would rather live in . 
i think , uh , 
at its worst i think we've got the best . 
okay , um , chuck , do you have any pets there at your home ? 
yeah , i do . 
and what kind do you have ? 
i've got a male siamese about a year old here . 
i live alone in an apartment , uh , 
how about you ? 
well , we have a cat , um , 
he's probably , oh , a good two years old , big , old , fat and sassy tabby . 
 oh . uh , how's the disposition of your siamese cat ? 
well , it's , uh , you know they're just , uh , aggressive by nature 
 and , uh , he's been neutered and declawed , 
so , uh , that kind of calms him down for the most part . 
how about yours ? 
uh , he has been really aggressive , uh , especially towards my little girl , for 
he's , uh , been so mean to her .
and you say you've had him how long ? 
we've had him for about two years 
two years . 
 and he was so mean to her , um , right after we first got him . 
so we had him neutered , and declawed , 
and now he bites her . 
he can't 
does he bite her enough to draw blood ? 
but he's a very possessive cat . 
he loves my son , 
it's his cat , 
and he's the only one that allows him to touch him or pet him or love him 
 and he's so funny , 
he just follows my son around just like a dog . 
he won't even let my son shower . 
he meows and wants to get in the bathroom 
and , while he showers , it's so hilarious . 
so he's quite a animal .
i guess . 
well as long as he doesn't get too aggressive . i guess with the daughter he's all right . 
you wouldn't want him to carry her off or something . 
well , we did , uh , actually take him to the pound a couple of times , you know 
but , uh , he seems to have mellowed out a little bit , 
and we do keep our daughter away from him . 
is that the only pet that you have ? 
we tried a dog about four years ago , and we ended up with , uh , oh , malamute and some other kind of mix . 
anyway huge dog that ate us out of house and home . 
so , we gave him up and tried . 
well , do you live , in a house , or a place where you , uh , 
but we're in a subdivision 
i see . 
we couldn't allow him to run free , 
so , he was just chained up all the time , 
and it was 
so have you tried any other pets ? 
i live alone in an apartment , 
and , uh , it's not that big that , uh 
although i've heard rabbits are pretty good 
 you know , i saw something on c n n or on cable here 
oh , my word . 
and they apparently , uh , 
especially when they're young when they bring them in 
oh , my word . 
and do they just paper train it or something ? 
and i would imagine that they don't have many more than one to start with , either . 
 well , rabbits are darling . 
that would be fun if you could get them trained . 
otherwise they're pretty smelly .
that's right . 
did you see the dog show , uh , 
i see . 
well they have , uh , uh , they call it the westminster dog show , uh , 
i think it's in new york city at the gardens 
there once a year live 
 and they had that on last week , 
and that's really kind of something 
it's on , i think , two or three nights for maybe an hour or two 
is that right ? 
 and some of the weirdest animals you ever want to see in there . 
some of them are really beautiful , too . 
 well , i'd be , interesting to watch . 
we live out here it's by ogden . 
it's north of salt lake city , utah 
 and we really love it out here . 
it's , uh , kind of country . 
we're only about ten minutes from ogden . 
so , we're kind of country but not too . 
do you ? 
oh , well , great . 
and , uh , no my , 
so how do you get most of your current event information ? 
well ,    , see i'm going to school right now , 
and , uh , 
and i don't watch t v as much really either , because , uh , my free time is kind of , 
and i do other stuff with it . 
while i'm at work sometimes , on the computer network 
and that's kind of helpful . 
i would imagine going to college , though , your professors and different things , 
you keep up on what's going on . 
that's true , 
i mean , my roommates and stuff , you know 
and the people i work with are pretty , you know , uptodate on that kind of stuff , 
well , i'm a housewife , 
i have three kids , 
and so 
 like major network news , 
or do you watch like 
just the regular channel 
oh , really . 
that's our channel here 
that's the , um , eyewitness news . 
 oh , see channel , where i am channel eight's , um , like public t v , 
so it's kind of different . 
oh , uhhuh . 
i think the , uh , 
i think a lot of the commentators on , like the major networks , like right , it's kind of appropriate right now because of the election stuff going on , 
but , um , it seems that , um , they kind of get to throw their opinions into how they , you know , report on the news . 
and i think even in the elections , they choose who they're going to follow and who they're not , 
and basically 
i don't think that the way i get the news is the right way to get it . 
i think you get a very lopsided picture of what's going on . 
because they can only report on , i mean , 
they give each candidate perhaps , you know , ten second blurbs in which you just can't get a full picture of , you know 
and the news , too , it just doesn't , um , cover that many stories , 
i mean , it just covers your basic , you know , violent crimes 
but other than that , you really don't know what's going on . 
um , i will read our current letters that come out on elections 
and , i guess i do read that , 
and i do study who's running in our area , 
and i do study what's going on in the economy . 
it , you know , 
and , i guess i do read other magazines , um , too , to get my information . 
what kind of , see , 
i subscribe to like science news , 
and that's real good because it gives like a brief summary of , or like the updates , like of what's going on in science without getting into a lot of detail that would , you know , bog me down that i wouldn't know about 
 but other than that i don't really read , 
i don't really subscribe to anything else . 
i used to read every month a reader's digest 
 but , um , now i guess i just have friends that clip articles 
or if i , you know , am interested in something , of course , when we were in war , i read up on that just a little in the newspaper 
oh , yeah . 
but a lot of the times , you know , i wish i had the time to read all the stories in the newspaper , 
but i just can't seem to find the time . 
if they put it out in a video , or on  ,
well , i remember back they were going constantly with that stuff . 
but , uh . 
 well , um , they even did a story on our news here in texas on what people wanted to see more of , 
and people said that they wanted to see more on outside of texas news . 
you know , we just don't want to hear every night all the killings that went on here in dallas 
that we want to hear what's going on with the economy , what's being done to help it , what's going on in other countries , what's , you know , just more information . 
it would probably take the whole news hour .
 but , uh . 
well , i guess we'll get pretty good news coverage in a couple of years when you host the , uh , summer olympics .
oh , yeah , 
already they're having like , um , 
in the newspaper they have a section , i think , every now and then , on the olympics , you know , 
and they've got like a countdown , 
it's like sixteen hundred days or something . 
i know , we're trying to get tickets to it right now . 
oh , really ? 
that's going to be crazy that time of year here . 
but , uh . 
i can't believe , i mean , 
they're stretching out the olympic news for that much coverage over , 
i guess people want to hear about it . 
also big in the news right now is the braves , because spring training or whatever 
 and they did so well last year . 
that's another thing , they spend a long time on sports , 
and i think um , that's fine , i would like to see more time spent on other things . 
it seems like , 
i don't know , 
they way they do the newscasts , i wish they kind of separated it , you know , 
if you wanted to watch one thing you could turn to some channel for it 
but i don't have cable . 
what kind of pets do you have ? 
oh , we have one rotten cat . 
one rotten cat .
it's my son's cat . 
i heard a laugh in the background . 
that's the boys . 
they know i don't like it . 
 don't you like cats ? 
well , i like cats . 
this cat is a , uh , more like a dog . 
oh yeah . 
he's , uh , a one owner . 
he likes one boy in the family and that's about it .
that's odd . 
how does he treat the other people ? 
 just , uh , stays away or runs 
but he'll follow my oldest son around . 
you know when he is in the house , he will come up and he'll jump on his lap , 
 did he raise him or something ? 
we bought the cat for him 
and so he's , uh , been the one that you know spent the most time with him . 
but i've never owned a cat like that . 
i've had cats growing up all the time 
and you know they are 
huh , that's interesting . 
 so , it's a weird cat .
huh . we have a mutt . 
a mutt . 
well , we named it hooper because that's where we got it from . 
 uh , some lady , she , uh , 
a lot of people , uh , uh , drop off abandoned pets at her house 
 and she use to work for a veterinarian 
so she would uh , neuter them 
and we saw an ad saying it was free , 
so we went down there and picked it up 
and it's been an excellent dog , 
but it's my first dog i've had 
and we got it because my wife stays here at home alone 
so that's mostly why we got it . to keep her company while i am away at work . 
so is that kind of your child right now ? 
uh yeah . 
you feel like . .
it's kind of good training . 
i mean we have been trying for kids , 
oh , uhhuh . 
but it's pretty good training , i think really , keeps her on her toes .
have you had dogs before ? 
uh , my brother has . 
uh , we didn't do a lot with them . 
uh , i never felt like it was mine or anything , 
you couldn't do anything . 
but , i mean , that did more responsibility . when its yours and not your brother's .
well , uh , we've , you know 
when i was growing up we always had a dog 
and we had mostly mutts , 
well not mutts , but mixes 
and those dogs always seem to be the best dogs . 
that's what we found . 
ours is , uh , like a cockapoo . 
i think it's half cocker spaniel and half poodle . 
but , it's a really good dog . 
i don't know , 
they seem i mean , listen better or something . 
is your cat a purebred ? 
from my son's friend down the street . 
would you ever want a dog in the family ? 
uh , we had a dog that was a , uh , mix between an alaska malamute and a labrador 
 and , uh , i should say a pup 
and he was just too big for our kids 
oh yeah . 
and uh , you know , was a pet 
and it was a dog that we gotten 
uh , the kids couldn't handle him 
and i was still going to school 
and my wife was working 
and i was working 
and so we just didn't have time to really train him 
so he was just tied up to a post 
oh , yeah . 
 so we gave him to , uh , 
i don't know if you've , 
there is a place out here , uh , called shorties lane out here in harrisville 
 and they have , uh , 
i guess it's kind of an animal shelter 
but he just takes a few the animals in 
and some he destroys 
and some he keeps . 
so we took him up there 
and he ended up keeping him . 
uh , cause he has had him for six or seven years . 
we've , saw him just about a year ago 
 and so we asked him about it one day 
he's been the best dog i've ever had in my life 
just goes everywhere with him . 
he would have been a great , great dog . 
he just needed a lot of time . 
hey steve . 
uh , uh , they just started a recycling program here , i think . 
actually , this is my first experience with recycling program 
but , uh , instead of just like tossing everything away which i always felt bad about , uh , i am starting to split stuff up . 
the only disadvantage is that they don't pick it up at the curb . 
they make me drive it like a mile down the road and spit it out down there . 
what are they doing up there ? 
well , here in saskatoon , uh , much the same thing . 
there is no curb pick up of , uh , any of the recycled products . 
uh , we're in a community of about one hundred and eighty thousand people . 
uh , there are areas where we could , uh , 
actually we have a couple of the , uh , handicapped societies , types of places where the uh , one they do as just a recycling operation and then others they collect the paper and ship it to other retailers 
so , uh , we are able to , uh , have drop off bins for news papers and cardboard and that kind of thing 
and then there's a uh , deposit program on plastic and glass containers . well , primarily soft drink bottles 
and so we are able uh to take it to one of the uh , rehabilitation centers 
and then they recycle the containers . 
they refund the deposit which is anywhere from five to fifteen cents a container 
and then , 
the deposits only on like drink stuff . 
primarily on soft drink , pops and that kind of thing 
 uh , so , they induce recycling of plastic and glass , soft drink containers . 
uh , we do have one of the scrape metal dealers that will accept tin and aluminum cans as well 
oh , okay . 
 there is a deposit on aluminum pop cans and beer cans and so the recycler , uh , with the handicapped group will also accept those . 
so , uh , it's fairly extensive , 
but then again uh , it's the initiative of the individual person because there is no coordinated pick up by the city . 
so , did they , 
are you giving these products to the handicapped group 
and the handicapped group is getting the uh , the money 
some home distributing the funds back to you . 
well , actually there's the opportunity for both . 
oh . okay . 
generally uh , the handicapped group takes care of the things that 
actually , the government has placed the deposit which is the inducement to recycle the bottle so that you get your money back 
and then the recycler run by the handicapped society pays back the cost of that deposit 
as well .
that's very cool . 
you know i heard about a similar program in new york city where , uh , a thing called like homeless incorporated or something like that , 
but what they do is employ , uh , i think mostly men , but homeless people to uh , go out and collect all the recyclable cans 
and i think it's mostly cans . 
there may be bottles as well , but like beer cans , soda cans and what not 
and they , uh , bring them up to uh , and get more money to these people that desperately need it . 
oh yeah . 
uh , i guess partly because of our climate . 
here in saskatoon at least , the majority of central , uh , 
well , i want to say central canada , 
but central canada tends to referred more to ontario and quebec 
 but , uh , we don't have much of a situation where we might call them homeless people . 
we certainly have a fair number of people that are on welfare and unemployment insurance and that kind of thing . 
 uh , there's psychological pressure against employing people to do that kind of thing although , uh , scouts and hockey teams and ball teams , those kinds , uh , regularly do bottle drives where they go around in various neighborhoods and collect the bottles at individual homes . 
do they do it with news papers as well ? 
they have done it some , uh , 
but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting news papers . 
they are actually at , virtually all of the shopping centers . like the shopping malls . 
there are several containers where the group called cosmopolitan industries collects 
or people can drop their used news papers and other papers in the bins 
and then the bins are collected . 
uh , some of the , 
 jimmy   , so how do you get most of your news ? 
well , uh , i watch the , uh , national news every day , for one . 
i also read one or two papers a day 
and i'm pretty much a news junkie 
and i tune in to c n n a lot . 
oh , wow . 
so , when you say the morning news , or evening news or national news is when ? 
uh , every evening at six thirty , i believe , 
i watch the national news . 
well , i would probably be a junkie or watch c n n a lot , 
but uh , i don't , uh , subscribe to cable 
well , uh , i give to the united way 
and so i figured that amount of money i just donate to that . 
as opposed to paying for cable . 
i take away a , uh , addiction .
oh , something . 
well i , 
uh , overall i , 
the quality of the news you get off of most , uh , sources i would say is pretty low . 
usually you get pretty incomplete coverage 
and that's one of the reasons why i try and get as many sources as possible , 
because if you hear the same story from three different sources , then you get a much clearer picture of what is going on . you would hope , 
but still , you know , hard to say 
what , uh , newspapers do you read ? 
well , i read , uh , the local newspaper 
and i also try and read one of the , uh , major dailies like the chicago tribune , or the new york times or something like that . 
for a while there actually a couple of newspapers because , uh , you know , my fiance , 
well , she was unemployed for a while 
so she , you know , really needed to look at help wanted ads 
 and so often uh , news . 
and , i don't know , 
new york times is okay , 
the quality of the writing has definitely gone down in the last ten years or so , 
pretty low . 
 but , i don't know , 
uh , i think if you listen to like n p r or something like , 
i really like n p r a lot . 
that's pretty good . 
uh , and i like listening to that on , uh , 
when i get a chance , when i'm in the car a long enough time to listen to it , because i , 
i n p r a lot also . 
i really like them because they give , uh , 
instead of being , as your newspaper or your t v news where you get a five minute blurb or a ten paragraph blurb , they go really in depth on topics which i think is good . 
and they also , 
their editorial stand point seems to be a lot better than , say , your major network news and that kind of thing . 
well , mcneil  , and lehrer , 
i guess he's leaving , 
one of them is leaving . 
uh , they're pretty good , too . 
had that invasion or whatever it is . 
sure was . 
uh , but i don't know , 
i guess it's still a lot of hype . 
look at the smith trial . 
i mean , that was a joke . 
that was , 
but then you also have things really good . 
oh , yeah , 
the n p r doing that , 
i know , 
i had , uh , some visitor 
and he was just , i don't know , fixated on that , you know , just listened to it 
uh , and i guess that's good when it's live , if you'll really want that , 
but that's not really providing you news . 
it's more like a media event rather than 
well , but the 
oh , really ? 
that's kind of boring to me , i think . 
it is , really kind of boring , 
but , you know , that's , 
if you don't watch it there , then you're going to hear somebody else's canned , uh , report , somebody else's view about it 
and that's what you're supposed to , 
if you watch the news , on what somebody else thought about it 
i guess that's true . 
but , one of the ways that i get information is , uh , every day when i log in on the computer i subscribe to this thing , 
it's free inside the company , 
it's called intellect 
and they basically , uh , type out abstracts which are really literally , 
i've actually read the actual articles , 
they're pretty g , 
let's see , 
mine's pretty easy actually . 
uh , i just got done reading or a couple magazine articles about the , uh , new saturns . 
uh , and , although i can't afford it right now , i would just love to have one . 
oh , really , 
you like , uh , 
so you're an american 
you want to buy american . 
regardless of that fact . 
it's the best car in the class for the cheapest amount of money . 
i'm interested in having it for , uh , doing a little autocross racing , uh , closed circuit racing 
 and , uh , it seems to just blow the competition away . 
it terms of handling , uh , acceleration , 
handling , power , everything . 
it just got like the top rating . 
it was compared up against , uh , 
let's see , 
there was like the mazda m x three , uh , nissan's , whatever , their n x two thousand , the civic s i 
and it dominated over all of them . 
all the , uh , raters loved it . 
i like the styling 
and , i seen a few of them actually race 
and they seem to be really good cars for it . 
what about mustang g t s ? 
mustang g t s ? 
uh , can't afford it . 
so you're talking about ones in a price range . 
i'm a graduate student 
and , let's face it , 
i don't make any money 
well , you can wait till you graduate 
and you'll have plenty of money , 
you can buy whatever you want . 
we'll see then . 
right now i'm stuck , 
a pontiac sunbird turbo that , 
it's fast , but unreliable 
and trying to get it prepared for racing . 
but saturn . 
would you use that for city driving and racing ? 
oh , yeah , 
the nice thing about autocrossing is you can do both . 
autocrossing is , 
what kind of track is that ? 
uh , just like a , uh , set up a lot of times 
and it's like really large , uh , parking lots .
and you set up the 
tight turns , hard acceleration . 
i've seen a lot of mustangs , uh , compete 
and it's interesting . 
they get dominated by the corvettes that are also in their class . 
oh , really ? 
i would guess so . 
uh , what are you thinking about buying ? 
uh , i think i'd like to get , uh , b m w a acura legend . 
the legend . 
a lexus , uh , s c three hundred maybe .
you know , because your b m w s , your german cars have good reputations , i think . 
well , i was actually in , uh , 
a lot of the b m w s are produced in , uh , uh , and munich 
 and i was there this , uh , summer 
and , uh , uh , the , uh , factory , uh , tours and 
they have the whole philosophy , 
i mean , they kind of even brainwash themselves into thinking they're better ,
i mean 
 oh , of course , 
they want you to buy their car . 
it was interesting . 
i also went to , uh , the porsche 
and , uh , it was amazing how they were completely opposed . 
oh , really ? 
and everything is put together with exacting tolerances 
and then you go to porsche 
 and no two of them are alike .
i don't know , 
which do i like better , 
i think i like the porsche's philosophy a little bit better , although it's not really practical . 
it's not realistic . 
unless , it's a toy . 
if you can 
let's face it . 
but b m w s good for that . 
what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to use it for ? 
just work , 
short trips . 
no heavy mileage . 
i'm putting on less than fifteen thousand miles a year . 
wow , yeah . 
so it's pretty minimal . 
that's cool . 
lasts a long time . 
that's mainly what i'm looking for . 
that's good . 
uh , by the mercedes , too . 
oh , yeah . 
i really like the mercedes . 
the factory was nice 
and is it different for the b m w ? 
uh , i think , well , something on the order of a three series , it's probably different . 
once you get up 
i can 
i'm not sure if i really want , 
all right ? 
how many kids do you have ? .
but  ,
you don't have children ? 
but you're married ? 
we've been trying for about two years but 
but actually i'm getting a call . 
i wonder if i could possibly take it on call waiting . 
could i ask you to hold one minute ? 
i'll be right back . 
they're going to get mad .
she had another call . 
she has  just  three kids , eleven , nine , and eight . 
i'm so sorry . 
all right . 
that was my daughter's brownie leader telling me that there is a meeting tomorrow 
that keeps you bu , 
do you have a lot of activities with your kids ? 
but , yes , 
both my husband and i work 
and our children are sixth , fourth , and third grade . 
and the school years are wonderful , 
they're just wonderful . 
the kids , they are real people 
and they are interesting 
and , um , i think as parents we really enjoy them in our personal situation 
our children have not yet decided to rebel .
i'm sure that's coming though . 
well , we had  ni , wh ,  growing up 
i guess i can talk about us . 
we had nine kids in our family . 
we had eight boys and one girl . 
but , my dad , uh , 
and the time that we spent with our dad was , he owned his own business 
so we worked with him most of the time . 
so that's how we spent most of the time with him . 
are you mormons ? 
that's what the utah and the large family . 
well , we're catholics . 
i came from a family of five . 
i had four brothers , 
the only girl . 
and everyone always asked if the girl got spoiled . 
i never felt spoiled . 
in fact  i always thought  my toys were destroyed .
i was going to say , my sister wasn't spoiled very much . 
usually busy fighting for survival . 
that's   .
 well , i do think with working parents i mean , there are some real issues here . um , 
i don't know . 
it's an interesting  problem .  
i happen to , um , 
i'm a pediatrician . 
my husband is a physician , 
so , uh ,   i talk to parents about this a lot . 
but children , 
i think working mothers or mothers who choose to work outside the home , um ,  need  very early to come to grips with any guilt ,
and i feel when my children were very young , i had jobs that helped me be flexible with my schedule and spend time with them and all that sort of thing . 
and i long ago decided i'm a better mother because i work outside the home . 
i really believe that . 
and it has , um , helped us to afford some things for our children that we couldn't otherwise that i think are wonderful particularly at this age , 
and i think our kids are real secure .
so i know it sounds like a rationalization 
but i really think it's true for our family , 
 and i think it has worked very well . 
and we're planning on having my wife stay home . 
there's no question , 
i think that's really the best . 
if a woman is happy doing that , 
i hate to put it quite that way . 
i was twentynine when i had my first child 
and , uh , i would not have been real fulfilled . 
i really would not have been totally staying home with a young child . 
it's wonderful to be a mother 
but , uh , i like the way i did it . 
i sort of worked half time . 
i had very flexible hours . 
i nursed all three of our children until they were at least a year 
and i , 
um , and i think we choose very carefully the , um , alternative situations that we had them in . 
some babysitting groups , 
again , i know it sounds like a rationalization , 
but i really do think sometimes they very early on are around lots of other children 
and they learn to share . 
they learn not necessarily to be the center of attention but that at the same time we have to be sure they are secure . 
 i think that helps . 
well , that's good . 
sounds like you're , have a handle on it . 
well , so  .
um , no , 
she's out , 
well , we just moved down here . 
we used to live up in seattle for a couple of years . 
you're still trying to dry out ? 
that's no problem here . 
we really liked it up there 
but then wh , 
so what do you think about , uh , recycling programs in atlanta , julie ? 
the recycling program here is just terrible . 
i mean it's hard to find places to go . 
i mean , kroger does a couple things . 
do they do newspapers ? 
i don't know , 
there's big bins out there , 
i don't know if they ever get  , 
i really don't know what the details are . 
there should be someplace where you could call and find out . 
as a matter of fact , i'm pretty sure there's a place you can call and find out the closest , you know , thing to you , 
but , i think there should be some kind of curbside service . 
that's the only way i could really , 
the one in florida is so cool because they pick up everything . 
they pick up newspapers and , uh , you know , milk jugs and aluminum and tin cans , you know , like soup comes in and stuff . 
during the summers , like around where i live the , uh , homeless people see , 
i mean , they all have like shopping carts and 
and they're go around and collect cans 
and so we used to just save them up 
and then they'd come around 
and we'd give them to them . 
but , when , 
during the winter time i think they move south or something 
 so , i don't do that anymore . 
and the recycling at georgia tech , like that , uh , outside the , uh , student center 
i know it , 
they just overflow . 
it piles up . 
so what's a guy to do ?
i just don't know . 
i asked myself . 
i just don't know 
and now they have , like bins and stuff that are a little more convenient because , mean , until seven o'clock , you got to pay to park at the student center , 
you can't really unload all your stuff . 
huh , oh , yeah , 
that's true , 
hadn't thought about that . 
that is very inconvenient . 
i know it , 
but , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
i'm kind of bad about it . 
the    , 
if i see a pile of cans or bottles or something 
but i don't ever take anything . 
well , i mean , it's real , 
you ought to , because the farmer's market recycles absolutely everything . 
and since we go there all the time , i mean 
 but wait 
probably   at all . 
i've never seen you before .
who are you ? 
oh , by the way , may name's julie . 
my name's bill . 
i'm from atlanta . 
me , too . 
uh , well , is there anything else you'd like to share me about your recycling philosophy , julie ? 
i just think that everybody ought to do it . 
do they do 
like , what about , like , uh , 
the only thing i know that you can recycle is milk jugs . 
what about like those grocery bags ? 
oh , yeah , 
they have , uh , 
 uh , what i used to , uh , 
now that i don't go to the grocery store much , it's kind of moot , 
but i used to just save up the ones that i got one time 
but , also most places , like big star does 
and i'm not sure if kroger does or not 
they'll ask you whether you want bags or paper or plastic . 
and little boxes that you can put your old bags in . 
can bring them in . 
those petroleum products are going to kill us . 
i know it , 
the hostile planet , i think ,
it really is a small ,
uh , you know 
did you know that , 
really not . 
did you know that , like , something like fifty percent of the world's landfills is like paper ? 
paper just seems so innocuous . 
paper doesn't seem threatening at all , you know . 
well , it is , though . 
it comes from trees . 
how can it be bad ? 
it is , because they , 
they treat it with chemicals or something ? 
why can't trees break down ? 
i don't get it . 
well , they do treat paper with chemicals 
like yellow paper , you know 
you know , you can bury a piece of yellow paper , 
it will still be there in a couple of weeks . 
it will be whole . 
you'll be able to read 
yeah , um . 
i'm glad you told me that , because i use those at work , where i work 
well , white paper's bad too . 
they treat it , too . 
well , what about , uh , papyrus , you know , made out of you know , bamboo stuff , from the 
i'm sure that's fine . 
i'm sure . 
maybe we ought to just start carving in stone again . 
you think so ? 
i think we should just abandon you know , the written word 
you think ? 
well , i mean , 
what do you think ? 
i mean ,  everybody  
kind of radical , i know 
we would no longer need 
that's true . 
everyone had a two way wrist watch t v s on their wrist ,
i would love that . 
so how do you , uh , 
so , it sounds like you've got a television going on there , 
so i can assume that you probably watch the t v news . 
is that , 
i almost never watch t v news . 
 i   , 
i get most of my news driving back and forth to work listening to the radio . 
uh , what station do you listen to ? 
uh , it's a local radio station . 
it's called , uh , k l i f , cliff . 
cliff , i see , 
not 
because i listen to , uh , public radio a lot 
and i saw a thing recently , they may be trying to start their own , uh , cable tv outlet , i guess . 
they're getting a little feisty now .
well , this station has a lot of just ongoing news 
 and occasionally in the morning , i'll pick up something like , uh , c n n or that , 
but i hate watching the , like , ten o'clock news 
so you have a paper or something or , 
i read it pretty much 
how do you like it ? 
it's been a while since i read the dallas news . 
dallas news i was in arkansas . 
 i , uh   , 
the times herald went out of business here 
oh , yeah ? 
 and so we really only have one dallas newspaper and one ,
well , that must be pretty bad . 
so , how did that happen , anyway ? 
uh , financial trouble . 
not how , 
i mean , when did they    , 
i guess they closed down about three months ago . 
oh , really . 
so , how do you keep up ? 
oh , me , uh , good grief , i read the times , los angeles times . 
there's , quite a task if you've ever run into one . 
they're , uh 
yes , they're very 
they're thick . 
uh , if there's something you want to know , and in detail . *[[repair bracketing wrong
uh , we used to have two papers here in town 
and then the herald examiner collapsed about two years ago because of , oh , i don't know , just nobody was buying it really . 
so there really is only one major l a now ? 
uh , there used to be ,
and , uh , they're not bad uh , you know , as far as a local paper goes . 
in fact , it was kind of weird , because uh , while i was doing jury service in santa monica one time .
it was like we just sat around and talk about newspapers and stuff . 
he was a really cool guy . uh , you know , went to columbia university and all this stuff . 
and , uh it's a pretty good paper , 
but , uh , you know , it's not the times . 
although you know , i'm sorry to see some of their , uh , 
they're expanding , i guess . 
i pick up like time magazine or something i think , uh , if they've got an interesting lead story , 
but you know , it's , 
i don't have time . 
i used to read time magazine a lot , 
but i don't read it much anymore . 
that's kind of a problem for them . 
there's a lot of people who fall into that ,
and then we have a local rag here in town that 
i see . 
the big dailies uh , out of their home turf , 
i have to admit , the times is kind of provincial , too . 
it's basically anything that's south of downtown , they don't bother to cover . 
now , they have started here running a three day , or three times a week plano section . 
and it's just sort of you know , four or five pages that covers what's going on in plano . 
but it's still not an awful lot of news . 
i know . 
when the times found out there was a place called orange county .
i mean , they practically acted like their reporters needed to shots to go south of the l a county border .
oh , i would imagine suburbs 
and , of course , they tend to cover the county , 
and we're not in dallas county , 
so they 
oh , really ? 
i find that attitude kind of arrogant , though . 
but you're not bothering to cover the things that are interesting to us . 
well , uh , i'll let you start , i guess .
 well , uh , yeah , 
i'm employed by a company that does do , uh , random drug testing 
and i've got some which haven't changed all that much from my first reactions when they announced it . but , uh , developed a little more , i guess , but haven't changed that much . 
what about you ? 
are you , uh , involved at all ? 
uh , no . 
my employer does not do that . uh , although , uh , i had an exemployer that , 
uh , the previous job i used to have , uh , they , 
i guess a few years after i had started with them they made it a condition of employment that you pass a drug test . 
uh , i don't know . 
my feeling is that certain jobs that when there's immediate threat to life and limb , uh , if should somebody be under the influence of drugs , i'd be willing to support that . 
for example , uh , uh , well , uh , uh , train engineers . 
because you know , uh , like , there was an incident several years ago where an amtrak engineer   you know 
he crashed and killed some people because he was , uh , smoking some marijuana 
and on drugs . and airplane pilots . 
but uh , in that regard , where it's not an immediate threat to life and limb or property 
uh , so . 
that's mine . 
it , you know , 
i go back , 
it is not a government , 
it's not , 
the constitution doesn't apply . 
but it seems to me that it still should . 
our company's doing it because they're a , uh , government contractor .
uh , and so some form of drug program is required to get the government contracts 
so it's the government that's mandating it to a certain extent ? .
and our company has taken that and gone all the way . 
okay , uh , 
first off if they weren't . 
so we'll just accuse everybody of using drugs and ,
uh , and 
well , i , 
then , uh , 
and they , 
so it's , a complete random testing 
well it's random in the sense that you don't know when . 
it is not random in the sense that they have said that within three years everyone in the company will be tested . 
uh , and , uh , you know , and write software all day . 
it , uh , certainly has no life threatening , uh , capabilities 
and , uh , yes 
there are , uh , jobs that are definitely life threatening 
reasonable and proper . 
i , you know , 
i agree . 
i mean well there's also the issue of , uh , 
out here , i remember hearing a year or so ago , that , uh , a lot of , 
there was a high error rate in the analysis of drug results . 
or , i shouldn't say high 
i mean several percent .
uh , of drugs . 
and uh , or some , you know , 
it's not quite that simple , 
but it's fairly simple . 
kind of a coarse kind of test . 
coarse kind of test . 
and then there's a much more , uh , uh , refined test , uh , uh , spectrography or whatever it's called . the chemo , 
is that done , 
and , uh , 
now let me ask you this . 
uh , at the time you hired on with this company , uh , was that prior to any , 
so that 
and , uh , 
they did that three or four years before they did it with everybody . 
and you don't know . 
but , on the other hand , uh , someone new coming in that knows they're going to have a test , 
this is lois . 
this is lisa . 
i think there really is . 
it's kind of an easy thing to talk about . 
yeah , uh , 
all right . 
like i said i guess it would be the work force , you know , as far as changes in the generations . 
i know because , i know when my mother was you know , going into the work force there wasn't very many opportunities for her , i guess , 
she's in her late forties . 
you were expected to stay home and take care of the kids 
and i've never faced that at all . 
uh , no , 
i think now , you go to work when they're six weeks old ,
and you stay there . 
and i feel like the next generation , you'll probably just work right along with your husband , you know . 
i think it's definitely gotten better . 
oh , i do to , much . 
and it's just going to get better . 
it really is . 
because women are in every field now , 
i mean i can't think of a field that they're not involved in . 
oh , i can't either , not a one . 
and i know at least in the medical field , it seems like they've come out with a lot further advances as far as female medications and things since women have gotten into the doctor field . 
i don't think that men really took the time to work on that sort of thing . 
even in washington , you know , 
hopefully , the next generation , it won't even be an issue , 
i mean people will just look at you as a person and not as a man or a woman , 
i think that would be the best goal . 
oh , i do too , 
just your qualifications 
and that would be it . 
not what color you are , how old you are , what your male or female . 
that would be wonderful , 
 i guess  it's kind of an ideal world though , huh .
i kind of think , maybe in time , that , you know , you'll go by social security numbers , you know , 
and that way they can't say well they picked a male over a female , female over a male , you know , 
or the way you look , 
or the way you , you know , 
your age or anything . 
i think that would be a wonderful way to do it . 
i do to 
just go by your social security number and then look at you qualifications you know , that you have . 
and then , 
and then if you get it , you know then , 
also , with , uh , women in the work force they've gotten a lot more options as far as , you know , what's it called , job sharing . 
like if you and another lady were to share the same full time job ,
oh , yeah . 
as a matter of fact , that's what i'm doing . 
is it . 
that would be great . 
it sure is . 
or , a lot of women i know now and uh , one of my supervisors , when she went on l o a to have her baby , we hooked up , uh , uh , a terminal at her house 
and you know , we could send her messages , 
and she kept in touch like that ,
i would just take her the actual paperwork once , uh , every week or two , 
and that worked out great too . 
that is . 
and that's a real attractive option , if you have the technology for it . 
all it was , you know , 
i mean , she just used a phone modem 
and like she was sitting in the office , 
so i think that's real nice too , to come up with different options . 
do you like the job sharing ? 
do you ? 
i really do , 
i think it's great . 
uh , well like , one week she'll work three days and i'll work two 
and she'll work two , 
oh , oh that's great , 
and we just share off like that . 
do you get the full benefits ? 
oh , that's wonderful . 
but we've just really got a wonderful system that we're working under . 
especially with children , and so many things going on ,
it really is , 
and that way we're not really missing any thing out , you know , 
either way , 
you have your career and your home life , 
and that would be a nice way , especially if you have young children . 
oh , it is , 
well both of ours is school age , 
but we don't want to miss any of those p t a s and , you know , all of that . 
oh , no , 
i think , 
my son's just in daycare 
but even that they have extracurricular activities 
and the older they get the more that you're involved in that . 
i think it's great , 
i really , 
and i look for more of that in the next generation . 
i do too , especially as women get up in management and can be in on those decision making , 
that would be wonderful . 
oh , i do too . 
plus , i bet it cuts down on your absenteeism because you've got two days off that you can do everything , 
so you don't have to , you know , unless you're just really sick , or the child's sick . 
most of the time now , you know , it's just the weekend , 
or just forget it . 
oh yeah , 
i have to plan way in advance , because , 
or , what i've done is found like doctors' and dentists' office with extended hours . 
that's been real helpful too , 
like my doctor stays open til nine in the evening . 
so that's real helpful , 
so you don't , you know , have to do it during office hours , run out on your lunch hour . 
i don't know how many times i've done that to do something ,
to do , 
well i think we've really come a long way in that because , 
i guess i take it for granted , kind of , because , i just , 
it's always been that way . 
but i know , 
but i can remember back growing up , my mother , 
i mean it was 
she always worked , 
but it wasn't that easy for her to just take off . 
oh no , 
i can remember my mother getting in trouble if , you know , one of was sick , 
and i know she probably didn't make hardly anything , you know , compared to the work that she did . 
oh yeah . 
i think there is still some discrimination there where you know , men and women work in the same job , 
i think men get paid more , 
oh , i do too . 
but i think that's improving . 
it's such a slow process 
it's frustrating , 
and you just want to make it right , 
but at least the wheels are moving forward . 
they really are . 
i think it's getting better , not worse . 
well , i should probably get back to my job .
i know , 
i know the feeling . 
call again . 
i sure will . 
hey , how you doing ? 
not bad , 
what's your name ? 
fernando . 
my name is nick . 
man , i'm , 
what time is it over th , 
are you in dallas ? 
or not detroit . i'm in , uh , california . 
are you ? 
  i  .
well , you're on the , uh , 
let's see , 
on the other coast .
shoot man , it's , what , midnight almost ? 
it's , uh , 
i'm watching saturday night live here . 
all right . 
what about 
credit card ? 
what are you working on  ? 
a masters in , uh , information systems . 
i'm doing my masters in computer science and computer engineering . 
where at ? 
at north carolina state university . 
how do you like it out there  ? 
uh , i don't . because , uh , i come from a bigger city than this one 
raleigh durham . 
that area . 
and it's really small . 
all you have is like towns built around universities . 
like chapel hill ? 
so it's basically a bunch of small towns anyway . 
kind of quaint little towns 
but they 
where you at ? 
uh , well , i'm in monterey , california right now .
oh , okay . 
this town probably has like two hundred and fifty thousand people 
and that's about it . 
it's a lot bigger than monterey is . 
but we're uh , just south of , uh , san jose and san francisco . 
oh , okay . 
and it's only you know , to a large city . 
so where do you go ? 
do you go to berkeley ? 
oh , okay . 
because , uh , i was looking at the ,
and they're asking like for a , uh , g p a of like three point seven or something 
and like they're looking like for , uh , g r e like ninetynine percentile and this and that . 
and it's like , 
well , that's what they look for . 
i know . 
that's why i didn't apply . 
i mean , it was like 
it's pretty tough . 
uh , let's face it , you know . 
and , you know , i , you know , did the , you know , 
as far as , 
i found it a lot of times with , regards to education , you know , the school only takes you so far , you know . 
it's what you do .
so , uh , i don't lose any sleep over stuff like that . 
so , are you going to go for your doctorate ? 
probably not . 
and , uh , you know , most of the navy funds that i probably won't do it until i , 
if i do do it , it will be after i get out of the navy . 
when do you get out ? 
oh , probably be another twelve years . 
oh , okay .
oh , you know i like what i'm doing right now . 
 uh , but what if they pay for it ? 
excuse me ? 
if they pay for a p h d ? 
 i think they have maybe two people a year go get ,  get  their p h d . 
because i know a couple of people here that work for , uh , the army . uh , 
i think they're military . 
 but , i 
 and , uh , uh , he works over in maryland .
and so he's doing his masters here . 
they gave him like a scholarship like for a year . 
 and he's doing it in like , in a year and a summer . 
and so he's getting that 
and , uh 
that's why you want to join . 
 but , uh , this guy , 
i mean you can earn a lot more money 
so you say , 
well , that keeps people  in  .
they like what they're doing . 
you know , they feel good about what they're doing . 
that type of thing . 
it's more  , 
 but i mean , you , 
once you get your masters , you can be earning anywhere between like thirtyseven , fortyfive thousand a year . 
oh , easily , 
i'm sure . 
i know .
i mean , like i say , you know , if you're at an upper level in the rank category , you know , you're probably pulling down close to seventy grand a year . 
but that's , uh , 
those are few and far between though . 
it's like , 
in i b m , you can get certain points 
 and , uh , everyone's a manager . 
but nobody can get one more point to become , you know , like whatever you need to earn so much money . 
since i imagine it's fairly competitive . 
it's like , 
i mean , i b m is like , 
there's a joke about i b m which says , you know , it's like , uh , 
a boating race , right ? 
and then they come in last 
and they have this whole team , you know , analyze why they came in last right . because the  person  asked for it . 
change the rower .
you know , it's like everyone's a , 
but , you know , it's like 
too many chiefs and not enough indians . 
i don't know , 
that can really slow you down . 
well , that's the way it works . 
i mean , that's why they're having problems . 
i mean , everyone's a manager 
i didn't realize that . 
i mean , it's like the people that actually do the work there 
and then the other people just plan it , you know . 
   push paper around . 
has anybody thought of anything ? 
and then this guy from federal express comes along . 
and they can tell you where your package is anywhere , any time . 
and so it's like the same thing with i b m . you know , 
so they have this think tank . 
and they got to come up with ideas . 
but , see , uh , the thing is , that i b m is so stabilized that everybody will buy their stuff . 
uh , you know , a lock on a lot of the market . 
and a lot of times you figure , you know , with the support that they provide , you know , 
people generally go with that because they figure that you know , you probably won't get fired for getting i b m material . 
and it fails 
and you're dead . 
 why didn't you try something more mainline . 
well i b m doesn't fire anybody . 
so you quit . 
i mean that's their policy . 
they never fire anybody unless you're caught doing something illegally . 
illegal or something like that , 
like if you're stealing something or doing anything like that .
but they won't let you off . 
what they'll do is like 
suppose , you know , like you're a manager . 
so they'll put 
so you quit . 
so , in other words , that's the way they force 
but they don't really say that , you know , 
you're always going to have great career 
hey , that's kind of sad . 
but i mean , they have just like different policy . 
i don't know . 
my dad works for them 
but it's like i b m like never in their commercials , they never put down any other company , you know . 
it's like 
well , they're the standard right now . 
or as far as that goes , you know , people think of computers , they think of i b m a lot of times . 
and the main , 
because see what happens is they have a good backup policy . 
and anybody can fix it . 
and so that's what you're going to go for . 
well , you know , that's a big thing . 
 and , you know , it's like , for example , like leading edge . 
have you ever heard of leading edge ? 
leading edge . 
don't they pro , 
they made like , uh , small personal computers . 
small p c s . 
i don't know . 
but what they did , i don't know , is buy all the parts that i b m would throw away .
 oh , yeah .
  for example , you test a chip . 
it can't last seven years 
but it can last five . 
and so that's , 
i mean , they're still around i think . 
well i've seen them around anyway . you know   .
 so , that's what they do . 
 and that's why they're so compatible .
and by the time you have computer for five years , you're going to throw it away anyway . you know . 
most people do . 
or they have to anyway . 
well , i mean , there's like , well 
in a way you realize , 
i mean , one of my teachers got this computer which , you know , 
it's like , uh , voice , uh , synthesizing stuff . 
and he got that . 
and it was wonderful . 
and then when you tried to erase and correct , you know , all the errors in your voice , it takes up all your memory . 
 and i want more , you know . 
and it's like jesus christ , you know , 
it's like why do you want more . 
because it's like one second of recording . 
i mean you put into wave 
 and you want to correct the errors into wave , 
it takes so much , 
i mean , it's like , 
of course it does . 
i mean , by the times it transforms into wave by mark off model 
and you put it in there , 
and you want to correct those . 
and then , you know , you're trying to make the wave smooth 
so you can approximately , 
of course it's going to take a lot . 
it's amazing . 
well , the more memory they're going to require . 
both in terms in ram as well as , uh , you know , standard 
 well , like they say , like nobody can get enough , you know . 
it's like once you have something , 
 and it's like  
 oh , yeah . 
you find out more , 
i was watching this program on t v yesterday . 
in nineteen seventysix 
and they were showing this like three d graphics view of like , 
like the   deal ? 
like a hologram ? 
this is like 
with just graphics on a , 
but the only thing was , that it was just lines , 
like if you  , 
i guess , um , i'm going to school while i'm working at t i , 
so there's not a whole a lot of time that i've got , uh , for hobbies it seems like lately . 
but one of the things that i do when i've got some spare time is i do some woodworking . 
and that , oh , i guess , ranges anywhere from , uh , carpentry work to , um , um , some types of furniture and , um , oh , i don't know what you would call them , knickknacks , i guess , stuff you hang on the wall to put a mirror on 
and i made some , um , candle sconces that you hang on the  . . . 
i have quite a few of those that my uncle made . 
there's something about working with wood that i enjoy , that , 
i don't know if it's the saw dust or the mess you make or the smell of the wood 
as you know , i think it's more like the mess you make , isn't it ? 
you don't have to worry about cleaning it up . 
because it's out there . 
you know i don't have to worry about getting stuff on the carpet except when i track in saw dust , 
and the wife gets kind of aggravated about that , 
but then , i get the opportunity to vacuum , 
so i guess i get some of both . 
what are some of your things you like to do ? 
well , when i have time i do like to sew , 
um , i had been doing a lot of crocheting . 
i make a lot of afghans or used to make a lot of them . 
my mother was real heavy into crafts , 
and i would help her with whatever she happened to be doing , 
and then , she would go to these , uh , arts and crafts shows and sell her needlework . 
oh , yeah . 
so , a lot of times i'd help her with that . 
i haven't had much opportunity to work on any other craft stuff lately 
we've been trying to start up a business and then trying to get my garden going . 
it's a good time for gardening . 
oh , yeah , 
it's been beautiful this last week 
i could do with a little less wind , 
but i think the temperature has been pretty good so far for working outside . 
do you find you do most of your , uh , crocheting or your knit work around christmas time ? 
i usually start in the fall . 
and my husband says i do it , you know , make afghans so i can keep my lap warm . 
well , that's kind of what my wife says . 
she enjoys doing it during the cold weather because she's always got something to cover her legs and feet with while she is working on it . 
i know it seems like , she , 
i think she made three this year one for , uh , my fatherinlaw and then a couple of brothers and sisters . 
so , those things they take some time to make . 
i found one that's real easy , 
it's , um , um , um , 
shoot , i can't even remember the name of it now , 
but you make it in strips . 
and it's real easy to do , 
and it's just that it doesn't keep your feet quite as warm because you do it in strips like that 
but it's , 
well , that's kind of like quilting . 
i think tha , 
mile a minute . 
that's the name of it . 
mile a minute . 
well , i'm not sure what she does 
first thing that comes to mind is some kind of chain stitch because she starts and goes all the way across , you know , back and forth until she winds up with this big piece of afghan . 
usually single crochet always starts it off . 
i know , 
we have a very small phone company down here . 
oh , okay . 
instead of call waiting or call anything else . 
we can't have that down here . 
we get disconnected all the time . 
well , i guess that's one way to end a conversation . 
well , it gets a little aggravating . 
i've got kids all over the united states 
and , you know , sometimes they get disconnected when i'm talking to them . 
have you started your garden yet ? 
um , boy . 
uh , what else did i get in there , 
and jalapeno peppers . 
oh , yeah , 
always got to have those . 
i think i had four , uh , jalapeno plants last year . 
i think one of them died , 
but there is no way that i can eat all of those 
nobody else in the family likes them , 
but always got to the keep those planted . 
oh , my husband doesn't like them either , 
but i can always give them away . 
well , that's kind of the way i am , um . 
besides they're fun to grow . 
i planted , uh , zucchini last year . 
uh , i planted four hills of them . 
i think i had three or four seeds in each one of them , 
and those things just flat took over . 
um , it wasn't until late , i guess in the summer , 
maybe it was because it was too dry , 
they finally started making zucchini , 
and i'm not sure when a good time to plant those is , if they should be planted early or later . 
it seems like all i got was , 
supposedly after the soil warms up . 
i would think so , um , 
seems like uh , to leaf , 
and it wasn't until late in the summer they started making fruit . 
so , i don't know if i , 
but i hadn't looked at a farmers almanac to find out when a good time for zucchini is . 
i doubt if zucchini is in there . 
probably the same time the other squash is though . 
you think they're later in the year ? 
about the same time that you plant okra because it's supposed to be warm . 
well , that's true . 
most of the okra that is growing around higher is , uh , later okra . 
well that's about , um , 
we decided this year , 
go ahead . 
i'm sorry , 
go ahead . 
well , all right . 
and thanks for participating . 
all right . 
well , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
all right , 
have a good time . 
you said you have four cats ? 
how old are they ? 
well they range from , let's see about a year and a half to nine years old . 
oh gosh . 
i haven't had my oldest one quite nine years , 
i've had him probably five years . 
oh okay , 
you get so attached to them . 
oh yes , 
i love my cats . 
i lost one , one time , uh , 
the first one i got . 
he jumped off the balcony actually , of a second story apartment . 
oh no . 
and he'd never been outside , like , you know , by himself outside . 
and it started raining 
and i was hysterical . 
i was , 
i mean , you would have thought a child had died . 
i called everyone i knew , 
i had every friend i knew in the apartment searching for this cat . 
i understand . 
and they laughed at me , 
they thought that was so hysterical . 
oh no , 
i understand , 
uh , we've gone through the same things with ours , 
you know , they've been ill , 
i mean i take off work ,
oh yeah . 
my boss thinks i'm absolutely crazy . 
and then we had a baby 
the cat was here first 
so .  know , 
it's hard . 
 and then when we go to sleep at night , you know , it's like my husband and i have to try to get any space on the bed because we have all four of them up there with us . 
oh , how funny . 
that's sweet , 
i have the two , 
the other two cats i have are outdoor cats . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and they didn't used to be actually , 
but they got kind of wild and weren't doing very well inside , 
so i put them outside once i got a house 
and they're doing great out there , 
they love it . 
but the first one i got he doesn't want anything to do with outside unless you're there . 
oh , uhhuh . 
other than that he gets scared to death . 
if you shut that door he goes into hiding . 
oh no . 
i think it's from the time he jumped off the balcony .
that's it .
and lord knows what happened to him . 
he's probably been through all kinds of nightmares . 
traumatized for life here . 
oh yeah , 
all four of ours are house cats . 
are they . 
we started out with two outdoor cats 
but our neighbor decided he didn't like cats and shot one of them . 
oh no . 
oh well he lived through it , 
oh , i couldn't believe it . 
we went through like twentytwo hundred dollars worth of vet bills . 
oh my gosh . 
the cat almost died , 
but he turned out to be such a wonderful cat , 
oh he loves life now . 
oh , i imagine . 
i wonder how many of his lives he missed , when that happened . 
i know , 
we wondered about that . 
but , uh , oh that was a traumatic experience for us too . 
oh , i can imagine , 
what did he shoot him with . 
uh , well , uh , from what we can tell it was a pellet gun 
and then he started chasing him with a bull whip . 
oh my gosh . 
people are crazy . 
oh yes , 
absolutely nuts . 
but , uh , luckily enough , you know , we found the cat in time and , uh , rushed him to the vet 
and it took us about six weeks of in and out of the vet and surgery 
oh lord . 
i mean he started off as a stray 
and then we did all this for him .
oh man . 
but oh , he's been a wonderful cat . 
i imagine . 
they usually are after something like that happens to them . 
it seems to mellow them or something . 
oh yes . 
but , uh , we wouldn't have them , 
i mean , i don't see us without pets , without cats . 
they just fill this void . 
oh yeah , 
i can't take care of them as well because they're outside , 
and it worries me that one day one of them won't come back , 
and i feel like they need a big home , a nice place where someone can have the time to play with them and things . 
but i can't give them up . 
oh no . 
i go hysterical when they don't come home . 
and you worry about , oh , who's taking care of them . 
oh , oh yeah , 
and you go crazy thinking it might be yours . 
well i didn't realize my husband was such a sucker for animals until i brought one home one night . 
we had to put to sleep he got so sick . 
and , uh , well i fell in love with this , uh , it's a chinchilla persian ,
and oh , my husband just died . 
we've got to keep it now . 
it's here now , 
we have to keep it . 
my first one that i got , 
i had just moved away from home and got my own apartment . 
it took me about two weeks to realize , that was real lonely . 
so i found this one 
and , uh , actually it was on a sign at taco bell drivethru that said free kittens . 
oh uhhuh . 
i'll call them . 
and he was the only one left 
and his mother had been killed coming back across the road to make sure she'd gotten all her kittens . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and he was the last one she carried across , you know , 
the whole big sad story . 
so of course , i had to take him . 
i felt so sorry for him after that . 
and uh , you can tell he was weaned too young because he'll nurse on your ears and your fingers . 
oh no . 
i asked the vet why he did that 
and he said he was probably weaned too young , which he was , because his mom was killed , 
but he is the lovingest cat . 
people who don't even like cats , like him . 
he never meows , 
he doesn't have any front claws , 
i had him declawed , 
oh , uhhuh . 
but he doesn't bite anybody 
he's just kind of there , real friendly and docile . 
oh that's good . 
oh we uh , just love them . 
they , uh , you know , get to feeling so lovey and dovey 
and they'll come up and just start kneading in our chest 
 oh yeah , 
we call that doing biscuits , 
oh yes , 
it looks like their kneading bread  . *[[spelling "their" should be "they're"
oh it just drives us nuts . 
oh , i just love cats . 
i like dogs , 
they're okay , 
i had , 
um , yeah . 
but they're a lot more trouble than cats actually . 
they really are . 
the cats are so independent 
and they have so much more personality than a dog . 
oh yeah , 
they do . 
but oh , they're so much fun to watch them play . 
oh they are . 
i love it , 
it's so funny to get more than one cat together , because it brings out their personalities . 
and they just act so funny . 
oh , we've got , 
well the two that were outside , they're like brothers , 
i mean i've never seen two cats so close . 
and , uh , they , uh , will get to playing chase through the house , 
and it is hysterical , i mean 
and then the other two cats will follow in pursuit . 
it's like this train . 
 a train of cats running around . 
i mean it sounds like a train . 
we have wooden floors 
and so it just sort of echoes through the house .
oh how funny , 
i can imagine . 
i wouldn't give anything for my cats . 
i love them to death . 
oh no , 
 uh , they're wonderful , uh . 
what are your cats' names . 
uh , we have , uh , bonzo , bear , poindexter , and felix . 
oh , how sweet . 
and what do you have . 
i have xanadu and precious , and rascal . 
precious and rascal are brother and sister 
and they don't look a thing a like . 
precious is a medium hair yellow cat , 
and rascal is a black and white short hair . 
nothing . 
not a thing , goodness gracious . 
and they came from the same litter and everything . 
we have , uh , uh , tortoise which is a black and orange . 
and she's so ugly . 
so ugly she's cute , 
i mean you can't help but love her . 
but , uh , very possessive . 
i mean it's like nobody messes with her mamma . 
and , uh , i mean , it comes bedtime 
and she's right there . 
is she the oldest one ? 
and she , 
well in fact i got her when i moved out of the house also . 
and so yeah , 
it's , uh , 
wouldn't have , 
i mean , oh , if something happens to her . 
oh i know 
it's like the end of the world . 
it will be . 
i know that's how i am about xanadu . 
oh , goodness . 
you get so attached to them . 
oh definitely . 
my mother has dogs 
this is nothing like cats . 
you can walk a dog 
and that's okay for weekend 
but cats are good all the time . 
i'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person , no , it wouldn't have worked . 
it wouldn't have , 
that would be a problem .
 oh that's one of the requirements i asked him . 
we don't li , 
have you seen those , uh , 
do you ever read cosmo . 
there was cartoon in cosmo about a year or two ago 
and it had this man sitting on a couch with his date 
and there were cats hanging all over him . hanging on his clothes , you know , 
they had ripped him up 
and the couch was ripped up and down at the bottom 
and they were just all over him and sitting on his head , the whole nine yards . 
it was so funny . 
oh yeah , 
you can't be pregnant and have cats . 
watch me . 
the child will learn to like cats .
i'm sorry , 
we are not getting rid of the cats . 
oh i wouldn't either . 
there'd be no way . 
the whole family was so disappointed .
oh really , 
right , uh , 
but yes , 
we just love them to death . 
i know , 
i love mine too . 
well , it's been nice talking to you . 
well it was nice talking to you too , 
i enjoyed it . 
me to . 
so well , you take this subject much more personally than i do , i suppose . 
 not even the last generation , the last fifteen years 
well , take it back , thirty years 
 and there was no such thing as a job or any hope of a job , well , unless , 
if you were educated you know , you might teach for a year or two before you got married . 
 and if you really pushed it , you taught until you had kids or something 
if you were a teacher . then , you know , that was it , until the kids were little . 
you weren't supposed to want a job . 
there's not supposed to be any reason to use this education or this brain that and how clean can the bathroom floors be on any given day . 
and then of course today it's supposed to be all the other way . 
you're supposed to only want the job , 
and , uh , your kids should be totally happy in day care , because everybody else goes to day care 
 and we have these wonderful people who are 
 and we'll see how the generations go . 
at least for a lot of women 
uh , mechanical engineer with t i , 
and , uh , i did it for six years 
and for one , 
well i had one while i was pregnant , 
and then one while my oldest was a year old , 
and it just drove me crazy . 
did you , 
i could not do either well enou , 
i couldn't put in enough overtime that was necess , or you know , things that would come up at work , that would require me to stay late or to come in early or to do something on saturdays 
oh , yeah , 
so it was you and the kid 
and your work schedule is . 
well that's the thing , see , you know , 
maybe if you get along 
for example if you'd been a technician instead of an engineer . 
you know , the technicians work the eight to five job 
might have been better . 
but if you're going to be more professional oriented , then you've got to have this , to be able to perform well on the job 
you've got to have the flexibility that doesn't really go with the family . 
and so it was , 
in my case , i just , uh , decided that , as long as my kids were little , i would be better off at home with them , instead of driving myself crazy trying to do everything at once . 
so you figure one of these days you're going to go back to being an engineer ? 
is that what you're saying ? 
well , actually i've found out that i'm not going to go back to being an engineer . 
what will you , 
i'm a photographer now . 
oh , okay , 
you've found something else . 
i have branched out . 
i was a photographer before , 
but when i went to college i felt like i couldn't support myself if i decided to be a photographer 
and i'm very mechanical , 
and mechanical engineering interested me , 
so i did that . 
and then you know , i did that for six years . 
and then i stayed home with my son , and did nothing .
but i was bored part of the time , too . 
and i wanted something else to do , 
i mean , you figure there's got to be more to life than sitting here playing with this child . 
it's great while they're really little , 
but as they get older 
i mean , a mother's day out program now once a week . 
both of my kids do , 
and so but a different authority than mom , once in a while , you know , kind of learning how to deal with society . 
and they need that , you know , to be able to relate to other people besides 
i think they do , too . 
and i need it for the break . 
well , that's the other thing , you know , 
they talk about women leaving the home and going out to work , 
well , still taking care of the children is a very important job . 
and someone's got to do it , and be able to do it right , 
and enjoy it , 
that's the whole thing . 
i think that's the thing that we're going to see , 
well , i think the biggest thing we're going to see coming up in the next ten year , even now they're starting to do it , 
but i think it's going to be more in the next ten to fifteen years , is that there's going to be a lot of women , 
and they're going to have to work it out to working part time . 
because if there had been 
because , i liked my job really well . 
but i was just pulled in so many different directions 
it was just driving me crazy . 
and now , with the photography , you know , it's working , 
that's what i'm doing , is working part time because i can put my kids in a day care situation for a few hours in the , uh , week 
the thing that i'm doing is taking school pictures 
so my kids can be in day care for a few hours a week , 
or my husband , you know , uh , when he's at home , can take care of them . 
so jobs have to , i guess , become more flexible . 
i think they're really going to have to , and not just for mothers , for fathers as well . 
it's going to have to be both . 
well , whose job is this . 
well , it's his job too . 
and i , 
to me the only important issue is the children , 
because as far as housework goes , you know , men can do housework just as easily as women , 
and thanks to a lot of new inventions , housework doesn't take as much time as it used to . 
so , uh , 
it's just convincing your husband 
because if he saw mom doing only that 
and you , 
you talk , 
this is what you do it now . 
and i agree , 
but still he was raised with a mom taking care of him 
 and that's a very hard attitude to change . 
 and it's just they don't look at things . 
most of the men don't walk into the kitchen and see that the dishes are there and that yes , you probably ought to unload the dishwasher and load the new ones in and run it . 
they you know , just scoot it on another spot on the sink and put the next plate down , and in a while get around to it . 
and a lot of that is how it was drilled into you when you were a kid .
that's right . 
 and , uh . 
and i think of boys and girls . 
they were 
but i think in between we got a generation of kids who didn't learn to take responsibility because mom left to go get a job and dad didn't move in to fill the gap . 
and so , basically no one was taking the responsibility 
and it's going to , 
 and i think that's happened in a lot of cases . 
some kids are really having it . 
if they'd been in day care the entire time and it wasn't , 
the ones that are now getting to be teenagers and in some cases , young college . 
un , you know 
but sometimes , it's babysitting . 
it's someone , you know , keeping an eye on the kids 
and here's what wrong , 
and here's what we expect of you . 
i think that was one of the main reasons that i quit , was because i wanted my kids to have my values , 
and i felt like when they were young , that was the time to instill it .
this is the way i feel about this , 
and this is the way , because that , you know , 
you add onto it as they get older . 
but if no one does anything when they're little , then it's twice as hard i think , as they get older . 
i'm saying this as i'm trying to keep my nine month old from trashing something . 
i understand , 
i wait until i put mine in bed before i make my calls . 
well , she's usually in bed by this time , 
but she's staying up late tonight . 
i want to have a relationship with her . 
you know , my dad was a very traditional dad , 
and when i was a child i didn't really know my dad very well , 
and i miss that . 
and i want , 
that's the thing , 
like we said , if women's roles change drastically , men's roles will , too . 
but men have to be convinced of that . 
and a lot of it's for the better . 
some of the women's roles , i think , are almost for the worse , because we're losing out on some things , going back to work , 
but i think typo: your for you're + probably didn't very often 
i know mine almost never did  . . . 
i haven't seen too many lately . 
i have kids 
and we went and saw the rescuers down under , under , 
do you have kids you take to movies 
it's a walt disney movie 
and it didn't get you know , as good a reviews as like the little mermaid , their last one , and got all kinds of academy awards and things last year . 
but this one i thought was excellent . 
the    , 
was that the animated version ? 
and i can't believe how good they're getting with their animation now . 
it's just the special effects , you know . 
and in this movie , there's this boy 
and he rescues this , uh , bald eagle 
uh , and it's a huge eagle , you know , wing span of twenty feet or something like that . 
and the boy actually rides on his back 
and he rides through the clouds , you know , 
and you see him coming out of the clouds , his head coming out and then the bird coming out , 
and you know , they're flying all over with it . 
and i mean , i know been computers or something for animation this day , 
but it was just so real , realistic and lifelike and good animation . 
it was a good show . 
even better than roger rabbit insofar as animation ? 
 yeah  .
there's a movie i've seen , roger rabbit . 
that's not a recent movie , 
but , uh , i enjoyed that show . 
that was made i don't know , several years back , i guess . 
latest one i've saw which was a mistake to go see was lionheart , 
had claude van damme . 
of course , uh , i guess he's trained in this , uh , martial arts of some sort , 
but the plot was bland , 
the acting was bland . 
it was just mostly centered upon his abilities to 
chop them up , huh ? 
chop them up , 
this is supposed to be the guy that's , uh , replaces bruce lee or whatever or , 
or he's singular i guess , you know . 
you know how they can make any single one of them in a movie to be a 
but chuck norris , of course , could be just about equal ,
and all of them , i guess , could be in that fashion ,
it was about , uh , a ,
and he got killed . 
so he deserts and goes to new york 
and he starts out by fighting to make money , 
and then he moves on to l a to where she is to just help him out . 
i mean the hollywood really must think there's some real dummies out there or something . 
i don't know .
i hadn't heard much about that movie . 
other than it was a chop them up movie . 
but , uh , well , i guess that's one i won't go see .
well , it was worth the buck i guess . 
oh , you went to the dollar movie ? 
they show up at the dollar movie right after they come out . 
you know they're usually not that great or didn't do that great anyway . 
a lot of , 
let me see . 
another movie i watched . 
uh , i want to see , uh , that new one , uh , that won all those academy awards this year , dances with wolves . 
i haven't seen that . 
have you seen that one yet ? 
i absorbed all of that movie in one sitting . 
uh , i guess what made it so good was the cinematography , 
the wide open , the spaces , 
and the music 
and , uh , well , it had an excellent story line . 
everything about it was good . 
um , i thought an excellent one , too , was misery with kathy bates and james caan . 
i'm not a james caan fan , 
but that was a well directed and acted movie . 
is that right ? 
i'd recommend it . 
it's a little on the violent side 
 but then what movie isn't anymore . 
our movies today , it used to be x 
you know , and p g s used to be r s 
and , seems like the rating system , you know , is kind of switching that way a little bit .
well , i have no objections to it . 
it's just , uh , 
and it's a matter of your taste , uh , 
it's just that , 
it's just that the rating system seems , you know , instead of having x now , they have what , n c seventeen ? 
they just changed it because x had a connotation with it , you know , 
and even on those type they don't show what you expect . 
a lot of those are really violent type movies . 
really gory . 
that seems to be the norm of most movies , 
let me see . 
one movie i saw , i guess it was a while back , red october . 
have you seen that one ? 
that was pretty good . 
i read the book before 
so i knew the story line going in , 
but they changed some things in the movie . 
it wasn't the same . 
i thought the book was better than the movie , 
but i thought the movie was really good as well . 
i always wait for the movie . 
i don't have time to read the book . 
i don't , 
i read about one or two thick novels like that a year .
that's about all the time i can spare . 
but that was a good show i thought , you know . 
i read about how they did , uh , an article on how they did all the special effects with the submarine . 
you know , that wasn't a real submarine you saw in the water . 
it was all done in studio with smoke and mirrors and all the hollywood magic . 
all those underwater scenes . 
i thought , you know , 
it looked to me like it was a real submarine ,
they    , 
that's the magic of hollywood , special effects . 
i hear this movie f x part two coming out is , uh , pretty good . 
is that right ? 
did you ever see the original one ? 
it was , uh , 
you ought to rent the , uh , f x part one . 
it doesn't say part one , 
but it's f slash x . 
huh . what's that about ? 
a , uh , special effects man who somehow gets involved in this , um , 
oh , i'm not sure . 
i can't remember . 
it's been a while since i've seen it . 
but he gets involved in some sort of bad dealings with somebody 
and he has to go underground , 
and he uses all of his special effects knowledge in doing what needs to be done . 
and , uh , 
to fool people 
and    , 
and using makeup and using the 
all the tricks . 
that sounds like an interesting concept . 
but you need to rent the first one first . 
to understand what's going on in the second ? 
uh , if that is that the second one follows the first . 
i don't know if they have the , uh , original actors on that first one to that one . 
they're supposed to be coming out with all these desert storm movies ,
i expected those . 
i mean they were doing their dealings with that before they even got over there , i think . 
well , they had some , 
in some of those , you know , you know , and , 
and they decide , oh , make it iraqis and americans , you know , 
and they just change the title yeah , you know , where they could . 
i guess they figured we can't tell the difference between an , 
actual names ,
eventually i'm sure they will come out with the , 
it was such a , 
i guess they'll probably come out with a lot of movies , you know . 
it was such a rout though , you know . 
i don't know , you know , 
they probably do the story of someone who was shot down early in the war or something and how he survived or , 
latest story , 
kevin costner i understand is supposed to be play schwartzkopf , supposedly . 
is that right ? 
i don't know . 
that's just one of the many rumors that floats around . 
or what you read . 
well , i think we've probably , 
it's been nice talking with you . 
and , uh , we'll 
keep on watching those movies , huh ? 
are you going to tell me what you've been doing lately in the 
i'll offer anything that i can on the subject . 
uh , my husband and i just moved here recently 
and , uh , we bought , uh , this house about , uh , i don't know , year and a half ago . 
what we have here now is just a basic three bedroom , two bath , brick house which is , uh , completely different from what i had had before . 
when i was working and before i married , uh , i lived in a little town south of here that is just full of old homes and , uh , historic old houses and things like that 
 so i , uh , tried to , 
i was in the process of renovating a house uh , that was about seventyfive years old . 
oh , my . 
so , uh , it had to have everything done from top to bottom to having it leveled , jacked up , uh , new plumbing , new wiring , wallpaper , paint , 
everything you can think of ,
well , i really did enjoy it , uh , you know , 
it was amazing what i found out i could do on my own if i just put my mind to it . 
well , i agree . 
i have done something , uh , like that , too , only not nearly as extensive . 
but it must be interesting now trying to do something to a basic ranch ,
it is . 
that's true . 
when , uh , i met my husband , he was living in an apartment at the time 
 and , uh , the town that i was living in only about eighty miles from here . 
so , uh , you know , we , 
really it was just 
the market was so good , 
we hadn't really planned on buying 
and , as you probably heard in the dallas and texas area period the housing market is just unreal . 
i mean you can get things for such a song . 
so , that's really why we ended up in a house like this . 
this is not i've found that after doing this other house , i have to have my hands into stuff 
so , uh , you know , i'm ready to get ahold of another one that i can have a little more input into 
well , maybe you can , uh , make that one charming and make a little bit money , uh , 
that's the key , you know , 
the thing is , uh , when we moved in they had just , uh , painted , we're , you know , wallpapered , new carpet and everything 
so i feel sort of , uh , you know , like it's sort of defeating my purpose to go rip everything out now and do it over just because i'm in the mood to do it . 
so , uh , we'll see , 
well , we just moved to charlotte ,
oh , oklahoma of all places . 
so i know ,
 and i'll tell you , uh , we had kind of a charming house . 
it was a cedar shake house ,
 oh , yes . 
and , uh , 
uh , so i tried to make it , after i sold my business 
i , in , 
i spent almost three years redoing . 
oh , yeah . 
and i considered it a full time job 
oh , it is , 
 and when we did , uh , 
we kind of had planned this , uh , trek to the east ,
i see , 
and so , i think some of the things that i did paid off . 
for instance ,
i love old estate sales . 
i happened to go to just a little estate sale 
oh , yeah . 
uh , oh .
and so i , th , 
well shoot i'm going , 
that's where i need to go .
i'm going to the barn , too . 
they , uh , auctioned some tools and ,
 but then they went over and started , uh , auctioning this big stack of bricks . 
anyway , it ended up after some pretty , uh , heavy bidding ,
oh , my word . 
and , so my husband and i loaded bricks in his ,
 oh , no . 
oh , my word . 
but , what we ended up with was about four thousand . 
 for forty dollars ? 
oh , my . 
and so what we did , 
we had built a deck on the back of that house , 
 but it needed 
so we ,
 oh , how fun . 
oh , how nice . 
and so for , 
and he did the digging ,
but i figured the sand and all ,
and it turned out beautifully . 
oh , i bet . 
and what satisfaction to know that you did it in such an inexpensive way .
well , it nearly killed me .
i hated to leave it . 
well , let me ask you , 
when you laid those bricks , 
i know my parents bought a house about ten years ago , 
they're fixing to sell it again , and move again . 
they're kind of , 
my mom's like i am . 
she's a renovator , a lover of old things 
 and , you know , they have to be doing something constantly . 
and the patio that came with that house , uh , was not laid on a , like , 
i don't know if you can put some sort of a plastic sheeting or something on top of the sand and then lay the bricks . 
but like sand bugs or something 
well , i , 
and , of course you know you have and things like that . 
well , no , 
i didn't have that trouble because , uh , we laid the , 
i did get some material 
i see . 
 because when you start 
and we put them on a base of four inches of sand 
 and then uh , we swept sand in between , 
you just put them together as close as you can . 
as tight as you can . 
that's probably , because they had , you know 
we're going to redo the patio , you know , 
we're going to pull up all the bricks , 
 but , uh , they just haven't brought themselves to do it . 
 and i also used a rubber hammer , a lot ,
if it wasn't quite level or something , i'd just get that ,
i think that they could , 
if they have problems with , uh , sand bugs of some kind 
well the thing that's funny is uh , they've done things like that , you know , 
i'll catch her out there spraying around , 
and then it's like , in two days time they'll come home from work 
and those little things are back . 
it's just , they're the most resilient little characters 
and so , i don't know what they're finally going to do . 
she may just , 
hopefully they'll sell the house ,
well , i think , 
and then she won't have to worry about it . 
 what are these things ? 
is it  diazinon  
or what is it that will , uh , 
 dursban  or something like that . 
i think in this area or most all areas they use , you know , 
and you know , they're ,
oh , that's true . 
but my dad farms 
but , uh , 
i bet  dursban  would do it . 
her four cats , you know , 
so she's sort of , uh , real funny about what she sprays . 
i think , uh , you probably just need to make sure that it dries ,
you know , it just seems 
i've been so busy . 
but , uh , i don't know 
of everything that i did , i guess i enjoyed probably wallpapering the most 
and i thought that would be the hardest thing to do . 
but , uh , gosh , you know , i ended up wallpapering every bedroom in that house , uh , up the stairway ,
 you know , i just had a ball with it , 
it was so much fun . 
oh , good . 
and i've sworn up and down , 
uh , my mom's great grandparents had this huge victorian house in paris , texas , 
and the one thing that she ended up with was the old door ,
 and she has that up in her attic 
and i have sworn that it , 
i'm going to find a house to put that door on before she does .
so , as far as looking toward the future , you know , that's my plan . 
i'm going to have to move fast ,
all right , do you do exercise ? 
i do a number of different things 
 and sometimes my daughter will come along on her little bicycle . 
uh , and then moving up , i run 
not every morning , it probably averages about two days a week 
 and then with my wife i actually go to the gym and lift weights , which isn't , i understand , quite exercising , 
but it's along the lines , 
how about yourself . 
well , um , that's a hard question to answer because i do physical things , but i don't always set out for them to be exercise . 
i walk with my parents , occasionally , 
nothing's real regular about this because i have a weird schedule and they have a normal schedule , 
and , um , i play racquetball , 
but i haven't since i've been out of school . 
i don't have anywhere to do that , 
but that's going to start soon again 
 and , um , i play softball once a week , which is kind of more recreation than exercise . 
because i really don't like to exercise , 
i think that's the basic point of it , is i don't enjoy it 
but if it's like a social activity or a recreational activity , i don't mind 
 so i have to disguise it , 
it's like feeding little babies food and telling them it's something else so that they'll eat it . 
that's right . 
that's kind of the same thing for me . 
i have to not know that it's exercise so i can do it . 
so you look at it more as a task . 
well , yeah , 
if it's exercise , it's a task . 
i don't want to do anything i have to do . 
i see . 
i mean , i'll voluntarily clean the bathroom , 
but i won't do it if i have to do it . 
so , i'm thirtytwo years old 
i'm twentytwo . 
 and so , it's interesting that as you get older you begin to understand that you need to exercise . 
my job at texas instruments , i have to sit in front of a computer all day and make phone calls , so , that , i don't get any exercise doing that 
 and plus there's a build up of stress 
 so i need to go out and take those walks after dinner , 
and i need to go out in the morning and run 
or i'll just get nuts 
 so that's kind of a motivator , 
eating right and no cholesterol and all that . 
that all , 
i do all that . 
i'm sure , i will do , 
i'm doing that more and more than i used to 
i'm getting better about this knowing that i need exercise and doing it , but it's still at the task stage . 
is it a pleasure for you , 
or are you , 
well , it's a , 
something as simple as a walk with my wife is very enjoyable . 
i do that at the end of the day , 
and it takes , you know , 
during that time the stress from the day goes away . 
i get to share whatever i did with my wife , and vice versa . 
going to the gym than , like , 
oh , and the running , 
and i enjoy that too . 
i've been running since high school 
so , running , i'm at that point which you probably get to after about six months of dedicated 
 and you don't think about the pain of it . 
you take the time to relax some how 
and you think about other things . 
during those first few months you have to think about running and why your elbow hurts and 
and that's no fun . 
and it's so hard to get past that for a lot of people . 
i never got past that stage . 
the , uh , weight lifting on the other hand is actually , you know , 
i think i look better . 
i'm not a huge person , 
i'm just a regular looking guy , 
but just going to lift weights on occasion with my wife , 
and my wife thinks the same thing about both me and herself 
 so that pays also . 
that's good . 
so i guess that aspect of that takes away the work 
i love her , you know , 
i enjoy being with her 
i guess that's one thing , 
but also , uh , that long term benefit of a little bit of tone in your muscles . 
that's it , 
i do the occasional push up and sit up . 
i haven't really brought myself to go to the 
because i felt real competitive there , 
and i need to find some place i could go and not feel like there's all these people who are just huge and hulking that are  . . . 
oh , yeah , 
i don't let that bother me , 
but , yeah , 
that's something that comes with time , too .
i'll tell you , the sit ups and push ups are excellent 
it's your own , 
you're struggling against your own body weight 
you can have variety by putting your feet higher or lower , by putting your arms further apart or closer together , by doing them real quick or real slow 
 and you can actually get a good wo , 
i know in the push up , at least , you can get chest muscles and the back of your arms quite built up 
that's a good idea , 
but i do have my ride , 
we have a stationary bicycle and a stair step machine here at the house . 
oh , is that right . 
i'll do those once in a while just 
i'll get up 
that's funny . 
it's , i guess , pretty healthy , 
but i don't have a regular plan , that's 
i need to get started on that . 
getting the exercise otherwise . 
when your life becomes sedentary is when you have to make yourself a 
and what's real funny about plans is that there's a struggle when you add a plan to your life , 
something else has to go away 
well , the answer's 
if i'm going to walk at night , what do i trade it off for . 
well , star trek 
 or , you know , it's always trade offs , 
and you actually 
it's , i mean , not just exercise , but anything . 
and , uh , i don't think you should worry about not having a program yet . 
that'll come 
i guess if you care , or if your future wife , uh , gives you a reason to care 
well , i hope so . 
sounds good . 
nice talking with you , craig . 
you too . 
have a nice day . 
you too . 
good day . 
what do you think is the biggest problem ? 
the biggest problem , well , like in this part of town seems to be the attitude and the atmosphere in the schools 
but it's , 
i don't know , 
to me it seems like the schools are reflecting society in a bigger way 
uh , well , the values , more or less at home and the t v , just a general , 
i mean , learning is not a revered endeavor , really , 
i mean , it's a lot more , 
it's well i won't say socially unacceptable , 
but whereas like in , uh , a person that , uh , stud , 
they put a lot more emphasis on athletics 
and things like that are a lot more glorified generally in society , 
and i think that carries over to school 
uh , with the home environment being part of it . 
you know , if , 
i think too many parents expect , uh , the school to teach , uh , the moral aspects you know , while we're not going to worry about , uh , teaching you manners or teaching you respect for anyone or anything like that , you know , and then expect them to pick it up at school , 
you're not going to do that , you know , 
you're going to carry to school , uh , out into the world , you know , what you learned at home , 
and , uh 
and part of it's the family , i think , 
and part of it's , uh , the living conditions certain people are subjected too , 
drugs is a big problem now , 
and i think that's another root problem . 
you know , i wonder if that's a root problem or not , 
because i think about that a lot , 
and it's just like , everybody likes to blame everything on drugs now , 
but i wonder , you know , 
do you get the , 
oh , that's kind of side tracked , 
but , uh , i just remember seeing on the news the other night , they had the thing about how catholic schools are doing so much better 
catholic schools are generally considered a little bit easier than the public schools , 
but , uh , they still had a better success rate , simply because they started with a lot better raw material . 
i mean everybody that went to a catholic school uh , at least the parents did , at least , had education as a priority 
and i wonder if , not so much that , uh , 
well , i think it's the socioeconomic mix 
you look at the schools like that where you've got a lot of kids well off , you know , going to a private catholic school or whatever , uh , 
 and they're not all that way , 
but , you know , some that are 
this is interesting because in my mind i don't have the stereotype of a catholic school being a suburban kind of environment , 
but , uh , this was actually inner city 
people were sending , 
i mean , just because their kids had the ability try and get an education , they didn't send him to a public school , you know , 
like you said , you have the drug problem and just the general atmosphere where you're pressured not to learn in instance , 
well , you know , in a lot of cases like that , where , you know , if kids are going to a public parochial school like that , do well , you know , 
and that may be passed on down to the kid as well , 
and , uh , maybe they pick up on that . 
and then from the other aspect , um , maybe the , uh , school itself has more emphasis on , uh , trying to do a good job because the classes may be smaller , uh , 
they may be able uh , to do a good job . 
i mean , 
and what would you do to fix the school systems ? 
 uh , that's a tough question 
uh , with , uh , 
i would try i think that are , 
and i think this is happening some around the country in terms of , um , morals , trying to teach the kinds of things and respect for other people . 
uh , i think that's a big part of it . 
you know , people , you know , 
if you don't care about property and people , you know , you're not going to care uh , about learning , i think .
you're not going to really care about yourself . 
that's what i was going to say . 
it's the chicken and the egg thing . 
i wonder , i mean , a lot of times people literally tear apart their own schools 
and you get , 
i mean , it's been a while since i been in high school . 
they're even in grade school when they do that . 
but i can't remember exactly what goes through their head when they're doing that . 
but you got to think in a way it's kind of a outward showing of that they don't think they have a chance of doing anything , and take it out on the school . 
well , you know , and i , 
but that's not an easy task , you know , 
that's why i say , it's a tough question what would you do , 
because , you know , even trying to instill those values is kind of hard you know , in a home which may be , uh , just the pits , 
and uh , you don't have any kind of a good environment to live in , you know , 
i could see where that would be a problem , 
and i think it's  . . . 
well , uh , i guess because i work quite a bit with lawyers , i'm not a lawyer , uh , that i find a lot of things are so specialized that i'm not sure , 
and of the value of , and worth , so that they have real problems when it comes to , uh , uh , 
they can find guilt or innocence 
 uh , but then when you quantify things and might also hold criminal trials for how many years is appropriate , uh , that they might leave it to somebody else who , uh , has expertise in that . 
i agree , too . 
i don't think the jury should be the ones sentencings down . 
i think the judges should , 
or even a panel than just regular civil people .
because i find that , uh , 
i've been on a few juries 
and , uh , as a say , i tend to be around , uh , civil cases because i've been an expert witness some , 
and , uh , many matters are so complicated that it's so hard to , uh , come up with the fair value , uh , or the fair sentence 
and one thing that you get if you have some expertise is , uh , you know the range of possible values or terms or , you know , how heinous was the crime . 
uh , that , uh , 
when i only do something one , two or three times i'm hardly an expert on it , 
and most juries over a period of five or ten years you might sit on three . 
and so how do you relate as to whether this particular armed robbery was you know , worth five years or twentyfive . 
 and most people that do sit on juries , 
some people just sit on them once in their lifetime , you know , if they're that lucky sometimes .
and they may have some different idea , 
i mean , it might be more important for them to put a the punishment didn't fit the crime .
that better knowledge of it . 
the only thing i worry about sometimes is does happen . 
i mean , we can't say it doesn't , because it does happen . 
i mean not everybody has the right morals sometimes . 
people can be paid off politically 
and sometimes that's not real fair either , though 
well , one of the others things that gets me well , that go on . 
one is , you often see in the headlines the big numbers . 
uh , and many of those get overturned or get reduced in terms of sentences , or get changed 
and that never makes the press 
and so , when , uh , you or i as an individual gets on a jury we tend to have certain mental images of what's what because we see the headlines , uh , 
and we don't have , again , a lot of knowledge , 
so we don't know what is really going on , what is , uh , really the range of sentences or awards that uh , are actually , uh , in the end 
say a rapist , come in , 
sentencing reduced because he's gone to a lesser charge , like , i don't know what , assault or something or , 
but , which doesn't make any sense to me either . 
i know it's hard to prove rape and whatnot 
and the person that was raped or whatever doesn't , 
i mean it's embarrassing 
and they're put on like , they were the ones that caused it or whatever , 
but , to me , when you do the crime , then you should pay for whatever you did , 
and you shouldn't be able to go on the lesser charge . 
i can go out and do it again and , you know 
that's not right . 
well , that's where , uh , the role of juries is restricted 
and , i'm not sure i'd want to change that aspect of it , 
one is , it's restricted in the sense that , juries only decide the charges that are actually , uh , brought , you know 
if it's first degree rape , second degree rape or whatever , they only get to decide on that , 
well , okay this person has been charged with first degree rape , uh , 
and you can decide guilt or innocence on that . 
uh , such like , maybe in murder they get to choose whether it's , uh , premeditated or one or two of the lesser degrees . 
the other thing that juries are restricted on even in my own experiences , that you usually don't get to hear all the information . 
it's what information is presented 
and , uh , i don't know that juries have a right to know more because in a sense we call those safeguards , 
but often juries hear only a fraction of the story when they have to decide guilt or innocence . 
and to me , whether it pertains to the case or not , 
somebody thinks it had , because they've got it there . 
so the two lawyers are the ones that have all the information . 
don't they ? 
the oath is to tell the truth , 
the whole truth and nothing but the truth , is that they want , uh , 
they don't want , uh , the whole truth . 
i mean 
they only put part of it . 
because stories look very different when you hear different parts of the truth . 
well , that's just like that old witness game , 
well , it's a game kids play , too , 
but , uh , somebody did it , just for your train of thought where they showed something 
and they asked , 
there were , uh , like four people , 
my name is nola . 
i'm in plano , texas . 
hi nola , 
i'm steve . 
i'm in dallas , texas . 
not too far away . 
that's unusual . 
oh yeah . 
 um , let's see . 
what's that mean ? .
i definitely , 
i mean there's plenty of things to talk about there . 
that's a , 
 okay , uh , 
but , oh , 
in social changes is that , 
uh , it seems to me that , uh , 
that involves 
does that , 
like a lot , 
it seems like the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer , is even more ,
there is a 
um , perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was . 
it's like people are starting to give up hope 
and they start out very poor . 
let's see , 
that's a bad tangent to get on . 
what else has changed between the sixties and the eighties 
i think , uh , in my situation , 
i have three children 
and we're , uh , home schooling . 
so , to education , um , are things that i think about a lot . 
um , and i think that involves social changes a lot . 
uh , for instance  , i think the schools are having more and more problems because of , uh , things that are happening socially in the world around them and because of their parents 
and things that are being taught in the home are not taught in the home , rather . more not than are . and children being put in daycare centers from very early , 
and i think that a lot of these things that have been happening , such as the daycare centers and things , are having a big effect on the social changes . 
because of the way children are being raised , they're not learning the values they need to learn . 
and they don't have the selfesteem that they need to have 
and they don't have deal with the things in the world . 
and , uh , i think we're seeing a lot of rebellion and things because of that and the things like the gang things that are happening 
 and , um  , 
it seems , so that , 
that is a pretty big change . 
it seems , even not just single parent families but with no guidance 
but it seems like ,
 oh it's , 
well i mean that's very , young for a baby . 
that's really sad . 
i think that a lot of people , 
and they think they have to 
i think that if they really tried , they wouldn't have to . 
i mean they're going to , 
like you said , i mean , they might be saving money , 
i mean even if they had to pay more now , i mean in the long run it's going to cost society more to 
that's right . 
it's already , 
you know it , 
trying to do all these programs like headstart and things like those . you wouldn't have to do that if mothers would stay home with their children and do things with them , you know . 
um , there's , 
and i think , uh , a lot of it is selfishness . 
people have become very selfish . 
they don't want to stay home with the kids 
there are a lot of two parent , um , you know . 
oh rather than she needs the money 
rather than that , 
 or , maybe there's a small need for money 
so she does it partly because of the money but partly for herself , too .
 huh . it , 
it's interesting w , uh , 
home study . is that what you said ? 
home school . 
home school . 
 , i have , uh , one going into fourth grade and one starting kindergarten and then a preschooler .
 oh i s , 
oh , well you sound busy .
so you're teaching them ,
and i think , uh , it's becoming , uh , more popular then it has been for a while , i think . 
home schooling's always been around 
but , uh , i can see more and more families going to it because of the problems in the schools . 
um , and a lot of it is discipline problems . 
a lot of it is , 
and you can tell which kids have been in daycare centers . 
it's really obvious to look at them and watch the way they act and things .
that's pretty sad because , i mean , i don't know , something's got to change with the schools . 
that's what it all boils down to in the end , usually anyway . 
 well , i think it's going to , 
when they're young , 
the home is the base , 
it's the basic unit . 
and that's where it all starts 
and if we don't start making changes in the homes 
and maybe part of that is educating parents better . 
and educating , uh , you know  , 
changing people's expectations . 
i know uh , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing 
but , uh , 
the aids issue is a bit of a problem . 
i guess the first thing that comes to my mind not having any immediate friends with that problem , is the financial end . 
and how can a country stand to , uh , spend as much or much more than they already are on such a problem , uh , 
but , then that kind of thinking is also tempered with the rumor , i'm not really sure if it's true or not , that , uh , we're not spending as much per , let's say , afflicted person on cancer . 
uh , there's some , uh , 
take breast cancer , for instance . 
it seems to be doing much more damage and affecting many more people than aids . 
and yet , uh , more people die of it , 
and yet the funding has already , uh , exceeded , 
aids has more money than , uh , breast cancer .
so , uh , 
i mean , if it's true . 
i've always heard these things . 
i've never bothered to dig it out and make sure , 
but , uh , i've heard it on more than one documentary that , uh , they were complaining that whoever's sitting up there making these decisions or whatever institutions raise the money and , uh , 
it's just one big p r campaign that , 
we think that's the world's worst thing 
so let's give money to aids . 
and yet we've had breast cancer problems for years . 
and , it's just 
uh , course , one of the shows i saw was taking it from the angle that , since it doesn't effect men , it's not going to get funded . 
and , uh , having thought about that for a while , 
 what did you think about that idea ? 
 well , that might be possible since there are a lot of men in control of that kind of thing . 
but then the number one killer of men seems to be the prostate 
and there's only one test that just recently got developed , uh , a uh , antibody test for the antigen in the blood 
and that's fairly recent . 
and yet men have been dying from prostate cancer for years . 
they've not really given it attention either , 
so it's not really cured , 
it's uh , not that heavily funded either 
and then that seems to be one of the major , uh , problems that men have in the realm of cancer , 
so , i don't know . 
or bicycle rides or whatever , how they fund whatever , uh , illness they wish . 
it's kind of hard to get an even keel on that . 
i mean , it's really hard to say , 
well , there's , you know , a hundred thousand per year affected by this one 
so let's give it this amount , 
and then this other one's only a tenth of that , 
so give it a tenth of that and just keep doling it out that way 
well , of making those decisions . 
uh , you wish that there could just be money for all these problems because they're all so serious , you know . 
i mean it's not so serious , i guess , until it affects your family 
and then all of a sudden it's the most important thing . 
responsibility just personally 
we really do have it as a society to decide which things we need to address .
with aids and with cancer 
and many of those things , uh , if they're not able to be insured then the country's going to pay for it one way or the other .
it seems like one way or the other we're going to end up paying for it . 
that's true . 
but  , 
you know the other thought that i had , uh , 
i've had several minutes to think about this after i , uh , 
while i was finding people , uh , i could think about the topic longer that the person that receives it , 
so it's kind of typo: that for than + unfair advantage ,
but , the other thing that i thought of on this is , i wonder if there isn't enough money , uh , in our economy or in our system . 
uh , it seems like there's so much that goes to things that don't really do a whole lot of good . 
i mean , yeah , 
they're kind of nice . 
but , we have such an affluent a cure for just about everything . 
just change our p , 
of course , then we wouldn't have any room to put people , 
but that's  , 
just change our priorities 
you know , you hear these ridiculous figures for pizza 
or you hear these phenomenal amounts of dollars spent for this , that or the other 
and then you have all the arts that are nice and aesthetic , 
they certainly do well for those who go to the symphony orchestra and all that , 
but , uh , had all that donation and time and labor and effort gone toward something else , 
all right , this is easy for me since i , 
and me too , because i eat out a lot . 
well i travel , 
i do about forty percent of my time on the road . 
so you eat all your meals out . 
i eat a lot of meals out , 
well i'm also married 
and my wife is an a one cook , 
but she enjoys eating out , 
so i have to share it with her . 
and , uh , actually it's very easy for me , because make it a practice when i am out , 
i eat differently than what i could eat at home or around here . 
so , i look for just about anything , 
and uh , it's a lot of fun . 
i don't have to really worry too much about price considerations because i , you know , 
i was going to ask you , could you go to , you know , nice places , 
so you know , memorable places you've eaten ? 
uh , oh okay you name it . 
let's see , 
you've got one uh , down near , uh , addison , 
uh , there's two restaurants that i particularly like that every time i get into texas or i get into atlanta , georgia , i make sure i go , 
and that's houston's . 
oh , houston's , 
it's a great place . 
it's great . 
there's um , right outside of reading , pennsylvania , it's called alfredo's 
but it is fantastic . 
uh , there's a restaurant , and i don't recall the name of it , uh , in , uh , panama city . 
of course , not too many people want to rush back to the country , uh , panama . 
oh , okay , 
because i was thinking , 
well , i grew up in panama city . 
this is the country 
i get it . 
uh , but i have gotten to quite a few . 
and i go to canada and get quite a few restaurants up there . 
 you know , and i know the locations , 
and i know the places , 
but lot of times i don't remember the names . 
i'd have to go back through some expense reports . 
but particularly , down in your area , i'm looking for some more restaurants . 
so , what's down there ,
do you like mexican ? 
that's one of the few , 
which one were you going to recommend ? 
well , i mean , there's so many places here , you know , 
it's just lots of good mexican restaurants here . 
but in the addison , well about everything that you could want in dallas is in the addison area , anyway . 
i mean , now there's a new italian place sfuzi 
i have a , 
 i've not been there , but it has a great reputation as one of the best restaurants in dallas , 
and now there's one in addison . 
i'm writing it down .
it's s f u z i . 
and it's in addison , 
and it's a great place . 
also a great place that they have like cajun food is copelands . 
i've been there . 
now i really like copelands . 
um , one down there is uh , i think it's an old schoolhouse . 
oh , yeah , the , i know , 
i don't like that place . 
well , i like the food , 
but i don't care for the clowning around . 
see , uh , uh , 
oh , really ? 
oh i've had , 
magic time machine is the place you're thinking of , 
that's it , 
i've had excellent food there . 
see , when i went , i thought , 
the people drove me crazy 
 but then i just thought the food was over priced for what it was . 
all right , 
well , that's great . 
uh , no , 
italian is fine . 
i make it a habit of always going out to pasta oggi's which is right down there in ad , 
do you like southwestern ? 
oh , yeah . 
well , now there's a good place in addison too called blue mesa grill 
all right . 
and , um , it's great , 
i mean , they have , i think , 
sometimes i've been when i thought , well , it wasn't as good , 
but i went there recently , 
so that's a very good place to eat , the blue mesa grill . 
and , um , 
well , this is great . 
this is going to give me 
a whole new ,
oh , okay . 
it was a pleasure talking to you . 
well , thanks for calling 
you bet , 
so do you have any recycling programs there ? 
uh , we're a pretty small town 
and , uh , the closest thing we have are bins like out in front of walmart 
oh , uhhuh . 
we've progressed a little bit farther than that . 
um , actually they have , uh , 
parts of town , 
it may have even spread all over the whole town , 
and , um , they will have these green bins 
 and it's just as standard as a regular trash can that they come by and pick up and dump . 
and , uh , just along with a trash can you have this green plastic bin , 
and you put your bottles in it and paper and , uh , you know , all those things 
you know , anything that can be recycled you just put in that bin . 
and , uh , i guess you can al , 
and a lot of the restaurants 
and , uh , oh , i don't know , 
i guess they're , you know , clear bottles . 
so , um , you know a lot of people do have those separated . 
and , of course , they have the , um , dumpsters , uh , the igloos . 
uh , and they have those strategically placed around the city . 
and , uh , they're actually going to extend it , i think , one of these days maybe to apartment complexes 
and , uh , 
oh , that would be good . 
things of that nature . 
so , i guess when you live in a bigger city it really becomes , uh , 
uh , we , you know , 
as far as our little pitch in to it we do recycle our aluminum cans . 
oh , yeah . 
but that's as far as we go 
because i take them to a girl at work , 
and she goes and cashes them in because , you know , 
i just 
oh , really ? 
see we don't have anything here in belton . 
it's a pretty small little town . 
i remember my grandparents and i used to always get out there on the road and pick up beer cans . 
and , uh , 
so , you know , that's about all that we're doing here . 
uh , they're , uh , getting a little bit more on , 
they need  to a lot a  more community awareness of just what  is it  mean to recycle , and what can you recycle and what you can't .
they're doing a real good job of , uh , separating it here . 
and , of course , there you know you have a specific place to put your paper . 
and , uh , they try to get you to go ahead and separate it , 
but they actually have the door to door pickup . 
um , and uh , i think it started out to be , um , just kind of a test , a pilot project . 
and it went over so well that they just extended it . 
and it's almost , uh , 
i don't know if it's done by a private company or not . 
it may be . 
but , uh , they just go around to each , uh , door and pick it up . 
wow , that's excellent . 
that's good . 
let's see . 
oh , and every year , of course , the phone books 
because , you know , phone books are pretty , 
well , for a bigger city they're pretty thick . 
 they are  .
and sometimes you might have two or three . 
so , uh , that's a big savings right there in itself . 
see ours just goes in the regular trash . 
it just ,
and there are , you know , some places that will set up you know for old newspapers and stuff . 
but usually it hasn't caught on yet . 
i'm hoping it will soon . 
well , the thing about newspapers and paper , 
recycled paper is actually very expensive . 
so , when you see something that's on recycled paper , they've actually gone to a lot of expense to do that . 
it's , uh , 
they're not coming out ahead at all . 
uh , it's really a cost . 
huh . i wasn't totally aware of that . 
i mean it sounds good to the public 
but there's really a big cost incurred when you do recycle something . 
now , aluminum i don't know . 
they may be coming out ahead . 
but i know ,
it's just good to recycle 
but it's , uh , not to their advantage . 
and it costs less . 
huh . well , 
we look forward to it to get better   .
well , i hope you all , um , uh , come along a little farther in the future . 
me too . 
it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
have you got a boat  ? 
do you ? 
i've had one for quite a few years , 
but i've not had one the last couple of years . 
oh , really ? 
but , it's something i've always enjoyed . 
do you like 
but , uh , my children all have been grown for a few years 
and we were using it less and less and less , 
so we decided to sell it . 
well , i heard , that's the second happiest .
what's that ? 
the day you sell your boat . 
oh , no , 
now i loved having a boat . 
no , 
i just heard that . 
that's just a joke , i guess . 
oh , okay .
first best day is the day you get and the day you get rid of it 
oh , yeah .
i just don't know if i'd have the time to use it . 
guy just  , you know , 
he needs his weekends free , 
 but , no 
i guess for the cost of them you don't really , 
it's hard to get , 
i don't know , 
i felt like i got my money's worth out of mine .
i had bought it used three hundred dollars when i sold it , of what i'd paid for it and had it all those years , you know . 
so you take care of them  , they hold their value real well . 
so , you know , you couldn't complain about that . 
did you go fishing ? 
oh , okay . 
i had a hundred sixty horse , uh , murcruiser in it . 
oh , wow . 
inboard outboard . 
oh , i did fish out of it occasionally , 
but i'm not too much of a fisherman . 
uh , but i 
i like to fish . 
would recommend it to anybody . 
uh , and now sailing , i've never been sailing . 
have you been sailing ? 
uh , yeah , 
i just like , uh , fourteen foot sunfish . 
nothing big . 
i've never tried . 
but i'd want to be with a skilled sailor .
but it , 
well , they offer classes out at , uh , ray hubbard . 
well , i've always thought i'd like to . 
i've never wanted to bad enough to make any effort to do it , you know . 
and , at this stage of the game , i'm not that interested in it anymore . 
oh , okay . 
we go out with friends on the , 
we go to the lake just about every weekend down at mount vernon 
and we go out and take them out on their barge . 
they're getting kind of old 
and they like us to take them out on their barge quite often , 
so we 
oh , that's nice . 
but , uh , uh , anyway , it's fun . 
i do enjoy the lake , 
but , uh , once the children were grown , 
and we'd go down there 
and i'd get the boat out on the , you know , saturday , 
and we'd go for a ride and enjoy it so much .
it's such a pretty lake down there . 
we'd enjoy it so much 
it got to where tomorrow the boat was still sitting there 
and we never did go out again 
and i'd have to go load it up the next day . 
where is that ? 
uh , mount vernon . 
cypress springs , 
cypress creek springs . 
that's south of here ? 
it's probably the prettiest lake in the state of texas . 
huh . what do you take , i thirtyfive ? 
thirty . 
it's east of here . 
oh , okay . 
hundred miles due east of here . 
all right . 
and , uh , 
 , we just moved down here a couple years ago , 
did you ? 
where did you all move from ? 
colorado springs . 
oh , did you ? 
how are you liking it ? 
oh , we love it up there .
well , good . 
that's where i grew up .
but , uh , we like it down here pretty good . 
oh , i think you'll like it better , 
but , of course it's hard when you don't have any family around . 
we got two kids that are 
it's hard on your folks , too , 
i know . 
they're all , yours 
and your wife's folks still live in colorado ? 
uh , there are supposed to be , uh , some people moving down here from colorado springs for t i . 
oh , really ? 
that's right . uh , 
do you work at t i ? 
uh , a friend of mine's dad was a program manager up there 
 and he just moved down here to mc , 
what do you , 
i guess it's , 
he's working in mckinney . 
i don't either . 
my wife does .
but , it's a good company . 
so , tell me the last time you went for a boat ride . 
well , actually , i went , uh , canoeing down the brazos this weekend . 
oh , my gosh , now that's boating . 
that had to have been fun . 
it was fun , 
well , what are your hobbies ? 
well , actually my hobbies now are t shirt making . 
i'm making t shirts and sweat shirts . 
in fact that's what i was doing when you called . 
well , that sounds interesting . 
what kinds of , uh , sweat shirts and t shirts do you make ? 
um , right now i'm making christmas ones with poinsettias and bears and 
is that silk screening , or , 
um , no , 
and then you , um , 
there's this stuff called wonder under that you iron it on 
and then you iron that on the t shirt , and you paint around it . 
oh , i see . 
so , it's real fun . 
i started doing it as um , just something fun to do , 
and now i'm selling them and pretty , 
well , how's it going ? 
pretty good . 
i just started last week , 
and i sold seven . 
i wasn't expecting that , 
well , that sounds great . 
i guess in my spare time i'll be making t shirts .
well , somebody has to do it , 
that's right , you know . 
give you a little christmas money , any way . 
that's correct . 
well , what are your hobbies ? 
well , i kind of have hobby fads , i guess . 
when i was growing up i was into coin collecting , 
and that dropped off about the time i hit puberty , i guess , 
and then , my hobbies in high school went just to the sports . 
now my latest one is classic cars . 
almost had it done , 
and i went ahead and sold it . 
oh , my gosh . 
but it was fun . 
i really enjoyed it . 
well , how'd you learn to do that 
oh , you just , 
all i did is , uh , i bought the car 
and then , uh , you know , you can , 
i , uh , was just in a supermarket 
and i seen a magazine for , you know , 
basically it was called mustang magazine 
and they had , uh , some names , some companies that sold mustang parts , 
and i just started ordering some parts 
what i did was , i redid the whole interior . 
i didn't do too much to the engine , because the engine was pretty good , but the whole interior and then part of the exterior , 
just kind of do it . 
where'd you get the car ? 
well , we lived in south dakota , 
and i bought it up there before i moved down here . 
so it was kind of rusted out there , 
there isn't too much rust on any vehicles down here . 
well , that's true , 
well that sounds neat . 
let's see . 
that about covers mine 
and t shirt making about covers yours . 
well , let's see , 
i've done other hobbies . 
i'm a hobby person . 
i've always done a lot of craft stuff . 
i always have done needlepoint and cross stitch and all that , 
and , i collect dolls , 
i have a huge collection of dolls which is still in new mexico with my parents .
from new mexico . 
so . let's see , 
what else ? 
i started collecting music boxes . 
i guess that's a hobby . 
that is . 
that's interesting . 
how many music boxes do you have ? 
probably uh , about twenty . 
do they all play different songs 
 or do some of them play the same song ? 
they all play different songs . 
well , that's neat . 
what's the most expensive one you bought ? 
the most expensive . 
i don't know . 
i've gotten all of them for gifts . 
i don't 
oh , really . 
   bought a few of them . 
i usually get them for christmas gifts on trips or something . 
well , that's interesting . 
it used to be tea spoons , was the thing . 
that's true .
i never collected those . 
well , that's interesting , music boxes . 
i have dolls from all over too . 
that i started when i was a little girl , 
and i have a lot of dolls . 
people would always bring them when they go to the countries , 
um , and i did that when i went to europe one summer . 
i bought a doll everywhere we went  , 
well how was europe ? 
it was great , 
it was quick . 
i was in high school , 
and i was in a tour , 
and we went all , 
it's kind of to establish better rapport with the different countries , 
and , um , it was called people to people , 
and we'd stay in people's homes , 
and then we got to also tour big cities , 
and i really enjoyed it . 
was that in high school 
 or was that a college thing ? 
so i'd like to go back , because we had , you know , 
everything was rushed 
i bet . 
everything was like an hour or two hours at the louvre , you know , things like that where you need the whole day , 
that's where a camcorder would come in handy . 
that's true . 
well that sounds real neat . 
but who knows now . 
i got married and , maybe some day . 
maybe it's one of those retirement things .
there you go . 
well , does you husband , uh , 
what does he think of your , uh , t shirts and , 
well , he likes it all right . 
he's been pretty good , because there's t shirt stuff all over the house . 
does he help out much 
what kind of car would you like to buy next ? 
well , i guess cadillac . 
i guess that's kind of everybody's dream .
well , why would that be ? 
oh , i guess it's a general motors product , 
and i like general motors because they're made in the united states , 
and , uh , we've had general motors for years and have always had real good luck with them . 
well that's good . 
if you had , uh , no financial requirements , if you could buy any car in the entire world , no matter what it cost , what would you buy ? 
oh , um , i think i'd still go with the cadillac . 
do you ? 
which type of cadillac , uh , is your favorite ? 
oh , i don't know . 
i guess the seville , probably or . 
the seville . 
that's a sharp looking car . 
that really is . 
it always has been though .
they have been . 
it doesn't have the coup de ville or the sedan de ville squareness . 
it never really has . 
it's always had it's own unique look . 
well , i've always liked that . 
i liked the 
a couple years they had where the trunk head would look like belt buckles across the back of it . 
oh , yeah . 
that looks real sharp . 
well , i think the ones now with all of the , uh , fancy gold lettering 
and course what is it , a vinyl top , i think those are pretty . 
and , uh , the , 
uh , i've never ridden in one recently , um , 
but they're supposed to be just real smooth . 
just a nice comfortable ride . 
they are , 
and , uh , they're just always , 
they look like they're sturdy 
and um , getting , you know , hurt like you would in a small one . 
now they've got a unique uh , feature in them now . 
 you know , into the inside . 
it'll go underneath the car instead . 
oh , i didn't know that . 
so that's a big safety factor they've got in them now . 
and i suppose they all have the balloons . 
the air bags , 
well that's great , 
so you say you've always have preferred general motors products   .
um , i go for things , you know , built in the united states rather than foreign countries . 
help our economy 
what kind of , uh , general motors cars have you had in the past ? 
mostly oldsmobiles . 
oldsmobiles . 
those are real nice riding cars too . 
oh , yeah . 
that's what we have now , 
but of course if i have a choice i'd still have the cadillac 
but , uh , 
we've driven them for about probably twenty years . 
uh , no , 
the ninetyeight . 
the ninetyeight , 
well , i don't think , 
uh , let's see , 
the ninetyeight , 
well i don't know . 
the one we have has a six . 
but it's a very good car . 
and now i have twentythree thousand miles on it . 
oh , that's great 
that's great . 
that's always nice to get , uh , reliability in a product . especially when you're spending , you know , anywhere from fifteen to twentyfive thousand dollars for a single item .
you just don't want any hassles 
its job , 
and i think don't take that into consideration 
that's true . 
they just expect you to buy their product , 
but that's been a key factor in me , is how reliable is this car going to be 
price is an issue , 
but it's not the most important issue . 
it really isn't , because now you can get like five year financing on them 
but i would go with the general motors any time . 
well , i've always been a ford man , myself . 
oh , really . 
but that's all right . 
well sure . 
you know , it's american made too 
um , but i've , 
ever since i guess i was growing up , my dad's always had fords , 
and , uh , well , i grew up in south dakota . 
so everybody has a truck 
 and my ford trucks have just , 
i've just never had problems with them . 
i honestly think i would die before my truck would ,
well , i , 
those are good products also . 
um , let's see , 
i'm sorry . 
 uh , what most annoys me are all sorts of phone calls trying to sell me things . 
i hate those canned messages they put on my recorder . 
um , my sense is that something may just have been done about it by congressmen   
just what went into the   
something about the random dialers that just dial phone numbers . 
i guess in some cases they just consider pickup and not let you use your phone for a while whether you hang up on them or not . 
um , but i thought i saw something about it having some kind of provision that people could specify that their phones were not for commercial using 
for business   selling you things . 
i have through , 
i'm sure that's true . 
no nine hundred numbers can be dialed from my phone or received . 
uh , some of   did too . 
i think government can do that now , 
is that right ? 
and , uh , especially with possibly children around . 
uh , that could be useful protection . 
and i don't have children around 
but i just don't like those nine hundred numbers . 
so , uh , i used to deal with , 
but it does not stop you from the , uh , dialing services . 
what are dialing services ? 
where they , uh , intend to sell you things . 
oh , oh , where people just call you . 
and leave again that canned message on the , 
 those problems has been eliminated 
those problems used to be when i used a credit card 
and i did not like giving it out . 
i   gave out my work number 
 but i think i'm not sure if it's by law just , 
otherwise i think the practice has basically been eliminated asking for a phone number . 
well , that's the thing i hated too about , uh , radio shack . 
how did radio shack work ? 
if you go in and buy anything they want your phone number . 
and i don't think they're going to call me and ask me how it's functioning , 
and i don't give that out . 
i have an unlisted number 
so i don't , 
that's one solution 
but get people calling you ? 
despite the fact that your number is unlisted ? 
and  you    actually have your number 
or are they just calling a number that happens to be yours ? 
well , anything that you buy 
and companies can purchase this list 
and what that is is people who buy from the mail . 
and they have a whole list of addresses and list of phone numbers . 
 i'll be thinking in mind the address is   , 
um , is there anything you can do about that like 
uh , no . 
um , no . 
so they can't stop people from , uh , advertising 
and that's what it falls under . 
it falls under the guise of advertising . 
 so , i don't care for it , 
but is it a legal , uh , solution for some companies . 
so that's the way things are . 
huh . yeah . 
i don't know . 
i think it's gotten much worse the last ,
maybe that's just because i've gotten on more lists . 
well ,  they , you know ,  
the telephone is not the only invasion of privacy . 
you've got the holy rollers 
and you've got , uh , all kinds of people knocking on your door and , who want to , uh , either direct you to the right path or want to , uh , sell you , uh , paper routes , uh , whatever , 
so , um , 
sell you magazines . 
i guess whatever is , 
i just don't give , 
oh , okay , 
so it's right up your alley , then . 
all right . 
 okay , uh , 
i guess i'm supposed to be all for switching to the metric system , 
but , uh , i sense that it's not going to happen anytime soon . 
i don't think it's going to happen either , 
but i wish it were 
because i got my bachelor's in mechanical engineering . 
i'm at grad school now in acoustics 
and all we do is metric stuff . 
you're now in what ? 
acoustics , uh . 
so everything's metric 
and then you go to read some order book or something 
and it's all confusing 
so i don't understand as much , 
so i think we should get one adopted permanently . 
well , i guess that is the policy , 
but it's been the policy for a long time 
and nothing ever happens . 
uh , i suppose some things well happen slowly simply by having it taught in the schools more to the extent that that's happening , having a new generation come up that's more used to it . 
a lot of industry out there is doing metric stuff because they have to . 
they have to for international trade . 
but , i uh , of computers coming into everything . 
i don't think switching back and forth is that big a deal . 
i think people need to understand more like what a meter is , instead of how many feet in a meter or something . just get used to using all the terms . 
because someone says a kilogram , 
no one knows what that is . 
everyone as a concept to hold in mind . 
uh , it can change it very quickly . 
i mean we're not the kind of society uh , that something can be posed upon , uh , by government will . 
no one seems to be adopting it . 
metric system , uh , no one wants it at all seems like . 
uh , the public is just very conservative that way in refusing to change measurement systems , uh , money , dollar , coins , anything like that . 
in using the old system . 
it's pretty tough when you get everything confused , though . 
i think two systems is worse than one , though .
because , i know , we do a lot of problems and things 
and they're half english and half metric 
and you make more mistakes doing all the conversions than you would doing the problems . 
  just get one . 
i prefer metric , 
but even if it's english , they should just have one . 
well , i mean , unfortunate , i think people like you are relatively rare who are coming up against this problem every day . 
i think so . 
your average guy jogging down the highway wants to know how many miles it is to his destination . 
 uh , i mean , there are things you could do . 
uh , but that hasn't been adopted very widely . 
they have some of those in ohio . 
there's this one sign's kind of funny . 
will go a step further to remove the english signs . 
that would force everybody to use it . or to quit selling tape measures in inches . 
uh , yeah , 
or , you have highway signs saying speed limit , uh , eighty , eightyfive , whatever would be the appropriate number . 
i guess a hundred is sixtytwo . 
hundred car is going sixtytwo , 
 so it would be more uh , like ninety i guess , 
car is going fiftyfive . 
uh , you suddenly have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now . 
you have a bunch of people trying to do ninety .
do you know , where you are , 
do the schools emphasize the metric system ? 
 i meant down , like , in the elementary schools . 
oh , in the elementary schools . 
i don't know . 
i wouldn't think so . 
i remember 
i mean , i think , 
but we never actually went out and measured anything or did anything on one system . 
i mean , i think my children learned the metric system , 
but it doesn't get emphasized over the other . 
they learn how many centimeters are in an inch 
and that's about it . 
so , uh , well , uh , what kind of vacations do you like ? 
well , uh , i haven't been to many places , 
but i have a opportunity to go to , uh , paris , france , uh , uh , with my friend in april . 
uh , her family , you know , lives there , 
and she's only been there once . 
her grandmother lives there 
 so i'm praying i get to go . uh , 
oh , that's great . 
it will be probably the most exciting place i'll ever get to go . 
have you ever been to , uh , like new mexico ? 
uh , no , actually . 
why , have you ? 
i was curious . 
i was just wondering what it was like . 
oh , okay .
no , uh , 
oh , haiti . 
where is that ? 
uh , well , it's in the caribbean 
and it's the western half of an island , 
with the eastern half that's the dominican republic . 
and i was down there with a program from the college that i went to where we would just spend like three months in a foreign country , most of them third world countries .
 so , yeah , 
that turned out to be a really good experience for me . 
so , what did you do when you were in europe ? 
uh , well , see , i went there when i was in high school , actually 
 and i mostly went to germany and visited some friends of my family and , uh , hung out with them , worked a bit on one of their farms and also went to a youth camp . 
what did you do on the farm ? 
uh , uh , uh , well , not that much .
just , uh , 
are you just kind of sight , just kind of , uh , 
i mean , i wasn't a great asset to them or anything .
but i , you know , drove a tractor , helped them weed beets and that sort of thing . 
and , uh , yep , 
and i went to a youth camp that included working at an old people's home 
and that was pretty interesting . 
and while i was there i visited my aunt and uncle who were , uh , staying for their vacation in france in nantes , which is on the west coast , like right across from england . 
uh , so , uh , where in france are you , 
paris . 
and , uh , um , how long do you plan to be going for ? 
uh , two weeks . 
last time she stayed two months , 
but we're only going to stay two weeks . 
and , uh , 
we're going to take a cooking class there , 
so that might be fun . 
a what ? 
french cooking . 
oh , great . 
and , uh , what else are you planning to do , if anything ? 
museums , you know , 
go to museums and , 
yeah , um , 
do you go to museums in europe ? 
uh , actually , no , 
uh , the closest thing i did was go to some like , uh , restored castles and stuff . 
there is some on that west coast of france 
and i went to a vineyard or two in germany . 
um , that's neat . 
that was nice . 
uh , um , so , uh , 
what about , 
have you ever been to hawaii ? 
uh , no , 
have you ? 
well , uh , well , 
i'm wanting to go there . 
where have you gone first ? 
oh , where have i gone that's anywhere . 
i mean , 
um , short term , i don't think anything's going to be done about it 
uh , are you saying you don't think anything should be done in the short term ? 
uh , the short term , the recession is getting top attention . 
i think that you're absolutely right there . 
the other thing is , is that we've got and , uh , uh , 
and that effectively adds to whether it's officially on the books or not . 
exactly . um , 
and that's got to be paid . 
uh , so this creates a pretty serious problem that's going to continue to be with us for a while to come . 
um , i'm not really , uh , sure that i even understand why the administration is proposing , for instance , tax reductions , because it seems to me that the deficit picture . 
it can only hurt the deficit picture . 
um , and on serious problems for the longer term . 
so that's the current predicament . 
it it's a kind of a catch twentytwo . 
i mean , it's the , um , 
my understanding is what supposedly they're trying to do by reducing taxes is to kind of jump start the economy , the idea being that if people have to pay less money in taxes , they'll have more money to spend , uh , 
and if they have more money to spend , then that will be a spur to productivity , particularly commercial productivity , uh , which in turn will generate revenue . 
but an unending spiral , 
and it , uh , 
uh , that decreasing taxes , particularly the kinds that are being recommended byebye the bush administration and things like capital gains taxes and so forth is going to , uh , result in substantial amounts of money , you know , for consumers to spend . 
and , uh , 
i'm not sure how i feel about paying on the long term quests that tax cuts are worth at this point . 
it's probably a judgment of how bad the recession is . 
uh , it would seem to me that there are other things that the administration could do . 
well , well , first of all you look to the fed to fight the recession 
i think that's been a positive development . 
i think what that's done is it's help keep inflation from , um , uh , 
well , at the moment we're doing very well on inflation . 
that's the sort of upside to the deficit . 
it's a sort of a piece of luck . 
that's the upside to the recession . 
yeah , um . 
i don't know , 
what kind of things do you think can be done uh , in the long term ? 
  well , can be done or will be done are two different things . 
um , at various places to look for cutting the budget , first of all i consider more defense cuts than are already planned 
but there are various other areas such as farm subsidies that ought to be slashed . 
uh , a lot of entitlement programs , like education aid , i think , uh , they should put in 
the reagan administration took all such entitlements to the poor 
in the longer term , uh , to make , uh , reductions there . 
also somewhat   is to collect owed to the government from various loan programs that people have borrowed . 
 that i agree with you certainly in the second situation , 
and i think certain entitlements i'm inclined to agree with you , too . 
education happens to be one place where i think that we would foolish to um , uh , 
a lot of education aid has gone to socalled trade schools 
but schools that teach you trades , you know , beautician 
oh , i see what you're saying . 
 and then they 
 and then they don't provide very much education . 
well , i would have to agree with you if there are circumstances like that , uh , around , uh , 
and i can't confess to having any substantial knowledge of that sort of thing , 
but taking what you're saying at face value , then i would have to agree with completely . 
what kind of 
um , well , i like to cook , um 
oh , i do too .
 but i don't like getting too awfully fancy about it , just 
if i have people over for dinner , i like it to be 
you can't enjoy it . 
and so i don't like or when they arrive , for me to be completely worn out . 
that's what , 
i like doing things like making lasagna just because i can have it ready and baking 
everybody just says how wonderful it is , 
that's one of those things i got famous for in college . 
you'd just do it . 
i can 
i like doing that kind of stuff . 
and it's fun , 
in fact that's what we had for a christmas party last week . 
we just had a bunch of people over 
and we did lasagna and garlic bread and , uh , yummy . 
um . boy i like that . 
uh , i do too , in fact .
well i'm planning a , 
and naturally this is appropriate because i'm planning dinner for people tomorrow night and 
oh , good . 
so tuesday night there'll be eight people here altogether . 
uh , actually one thing we have done quite a bit through the holidays , just because it's real easy , is just baked potato dinners . 
oh , yeah , 
and have , you know , like three or four couples come over , 
and i'll do the potatoes and you know , like butter and cheese and stuff and have everybody else just bring a couple of toppings , whatever they like 
 and it turns out great , because 
that's fun . 
but it's inexpensive 
plus it's real easy on the hostess , because you can just have the potatoes ready , and just have a salad with it , 
and you got a great dinner . 
that's a good idea . 
i like doing that part . 
i'm in favor of very little clean up , um , very 
we invariably end up at my house since i've got two kids . 
you bring this , 
you bring this , 
you bring this , 
we're done . 
and it's pretty cool . 
that's good . 
well , one of my favorites if i don't want to have other people bring stuff , i just want to treat them is 
it's very easy to . 
you don't like it ? 
oh , i love it .
oh , you do , 
i have a really easy recipe for that , where you just brown the chicken 
and then you put rice in the bottom of the pan , 
you pour bouillon or chicken broth over it 
 and you put the chicken in , then pour the , uh , broth over 
and you can put mushrooms in if you want , 
and then you just . 
over the uncooked rice ? 
 and you can either microwave it 
or do it in the oven , 
and it just . 
oh , how neat . 
it fluffs up , 
and it's really moist . 
now i've done it well , i guess you probably could do it same way , but cook the rice and then take a can of like cream of mushroom soup or cream of chicken soup , and put a little bit of white wine in it . 
and every once in a while , i'll slice white grapes 
and i'll put in there , 
and , that's just because i'm not a real big wine person 
but i like it , 
and then just bake it , 
and it makes a wonderful sauce over the rice . 
that was one of the first things i made for my husband , because i was like , um , 
i could actually find something i could cook real easy that would be sort of elegant 
you can get away with it 
oh , yeah . 
or , you know semi   .
but then , i hadn't thought about doing it with uncooked rice . 
so , just , like in a thirteen by nine pan . 
let's see , what was it , three quarters of cup of rice 
it depends on , 
you can really vary it . 
but you have to put the water in proportionally . 
i can't remember . 
i think it was three quarters cup rice to two cups water , two cups , um , broth . 
for rice 
and for when i cook pasta or something , i'll put a little bit of bouillon in there just to 
um . now that would be good . 
how long do you have to bake it ? 
um , let's see . 
i think it was an hour . 
i've done it in the microwave so often lately because , it's really easy . 
i do microwave too , a lot .
how long would it be 
or maybe it's only half hour . 
um , you just , 
until the rice looks fluffy , and 
oh , okay . 
do you just brown the chicken to get it colored 
 or do you go ahead and let it cook through ? 
um , i'd let it cook just a little bit 
ooh , this is a beneficial call . 
i like this .
i liked your idea too , there . 
but that one's an easy one . 
it's like , just put in , 
a friend of mine makes it where she goes ahead and seasons up with the soup and the wine 
put in garlic and onion powder 
but it makes a great , 
i mean , i've got a two year old and a four year old 
and they love it . 
because my daughter calls it her gravy 
and i mean , 
my , good , you're a picky eater , if i can get you to , 
uh , did you watch the bulls this morning ? 
i watched a little bit uh , of the bulls game 
and i , uh , had to leave . 
uh , in fact uh , when i left . 
who won the game ? 
they won in a squeaker . 
they won by 
is that right ? 
uh , they were behind as they headed into each quarter 
and then they came back in the second half 
and at the end , i think they looked like they were closing it out 
and then detroit kept coming back 
and , uh , i think the bulls won by two . 
one of the , uh , commentators said that they expected that the bulls would , uh , if they continued at their current pace , uh , set an n b a record for seventy wins in a season . 
they looked real good 
they do , 
and they , you know , 
i think uh , of , uh , uh , 
michael jordan really helped them out . 
you know , you know , thirty or forty points at every 
well , they're balancing their attack 
oh , i know , 
uh , just a little bit of the highlights of the warriors , uh , dallas game . 
i saw the second half of the game last night 
and they were impressive . 
they look good . 
billy owens looks like he was , 
that was a good move for the warriors to trade for him . 
now , uh , with the , 
well , they traded away , uh , mitch richmond , 
or is it tim hardaway . 
one of the two , uh , who , along with , uh , chris mullen was , you know , 
though three were three of the best in the n b a , 
and they traded either richmond or hardaway to sacramento for billy owens 
and , uh , 
good move . 
oh , yeah , 
he's really worked out well . 
the warriors have got a team , uh , 
and , uh , i think that will be real interesting to see what they can do . 
they're ahead , 
and the lakers are down , i guess in fourth , uh , position in the west 
in the east , i don't know , uh , 
is it boston in , uh , first place ? 
uh , you know , i haven't kept up with any of the other , uh , teams . 
i'm so depressed with the dallas mavericks , you know . 
they've had a hard time . 
they said 
 oh , man! 
well , yeah , 
but , i mean , just this whole year has been just disastrous for them 
and , uh , you know , they can , uh , pull out . 
it's unbelievable . 
how do people in texas deal with dallas , houston and san antonio . 
do you , for example , like san 
well , the dallas area here , uh , pulls for dallas . 
uh , san antonio pulls for san antonio , 
and houston pulls for the rockets . 
so there isn't much crossover , huh , 
there really , 
i mean , not a whole lot . you know , 
i mean , with the local teams . 
uh , you know , uh , of sacramento fans . 
it's true , 
to san antonio as it is 
is it ? 
so it's not something you'd drive , 
so yeah , it's not really a local , you know , 
i was thinking maybe david robinson made a bit of a difference with kids and that sort of thing . 
uh , he does a lot of local stuff there in san antonio 
and i mean , they have got a great club . you know . 
they've done a good job . 
i mean , of course , drafting a franchise like him certainly , 
that always makes a big difference . 
i mean , that's 
 uh , i think that's the way it works now in basketball . 
you know magic was a franchise for the lakers 
and , you know , uh , you know , i used to think one player really doesn't make a club , 
but it really does , you know . 
well , it    , 
you get somebody like magic 
and you can see the decline in that team . 
well , yeah . 
once he left , you know , uh , it's not the same team . 
there's not the leadership there that they used to rely on him for . 
well , i think you're right 
and i think isaiah thomas would fit in detroit 
and i think those things do make a difference 
and there are marquee players . 
and i think 
 oh , yeah . 
i don't know who would meet them in the west . 
uh , i don't know how good portland will turn out to be by the end of the year . 
they were so disap , 
who won that portland game ? 
you know , i watched only a few minutes of it 
and i wasn't paying attention . 
uh , and so i don't know , uh , 
but you know , phoenix and portland have both been very good clubs 
well i guess we're , uh , forced finally , to do a lot about air pollution . 
i hear that the major automobile manufacturers are looking at nonpolluting cars 
and low polluting fuels are being experimented with ethanol and other types of fuels . 
you know , i assume ,
that's what , 
 but i , 
i just know that , um , acid rain apparently is a big problem in canada from , 
comes over the border from us . 
i think the automobile definitely is an area and any industry that burns , you know , 
and then i don't know about chemical pollution . 
i'm not real into that as far as how it affects the air . 
i know we have a lot of chemical , the indoor type pollution . 
they have offices that are too well insulated . 
they found people are getting sick , 
 but i don't know if that affects outside . 
and the only thing i can think of would be cars and factories . 
the smokestacks or the exhaust pipes . 
um , i guess there's been a lot of pressure to , um , do away with the c f c's in these spray bottles which ,
there's a hole in the ozone or not 
but at last i heard it was , uh , discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought ,
that's wh , 
it's kind of scary . 
well , it is scary 
and i think it will , uh , continue to force us to clean up our act ,
we've got to learn to manage without destroying the environment . 
i think something too that you probably see in older states , all we do it down here once in a while we will have a cold spell is where people will use their fireplaces . 
i'm wondering whether it's going to get to the point where you can't ,
i think it will . 
in los angeles they're apparently going to , 
they've passed laws that , for habit , prohibit
and it's really bad in places like los angeles , 
 and , uh , it's not too bad around here although you see it , you know , more and more in the sky . 
and people in this country are really wedded to their , uh , cars , 
 and our economy seems to , 
and this i think is one of the big problems , 
in this area too since , you know , in texas we're so spread out , 
we have to drive so far , 
but i know in colorado i have witnessed that where when the rockies starts , 
but we're even getting it here . 
we can when we've been on vacation or something drive into fort worth or dallas 
and you can tell it in the mornings too . 
my husband likes to go out and jog 
and there's just a brown fog here 
and we don't even have any mountains that are ,
but they also said that more dense the population and the more we crowd together , the worse it gets . 
well that makes a lot of sense . 
i mean i hadn't thought about it that way 
but it , 
you don't have to have mountains that are stopping it . 
and , uh , they uh , making more and more highrise buildings 
uh , so yeah , 
we can comment 
and we didn't see this a few years ago . 
and i think , 
it was pretty clear here . 
and i think is an organism of sorts ,
and , uh , we're going to feel it , 
and i think it's going to be real interesting and particularly in light of what is obviously going to be a big structural change in the economy ,
 and in this country , uh , that people seem to think work are politically unacceptable . 
for example ,
and , uh , i have a little sports car that i enjoy using 
and i know just like anybody else how much fun it is to drive 
but i think , uh , we're going to have to make some fundamental changes 
i'm not sure how long it's going to take or what it's going to take because they keep saying that the economy is going to depend on how many cars and ,
and it's a shame too when you do see somebody driving a big car , just one person in that . 
it's a lot of waste 
uh , are you married 
and do you have a family ? 
uh , yes i am to , uh , both questions . 
and do you and your wife have a budget plan for your finances . 
uh , yeah 
we , uh , uh , 
basically there's you know , the expenses that are fixed during the month 
and we , uh , enter those uh , into a spread sheet 
and , uh , whatever is left , uh , after that we , 
i see . uh  , 
 so what do you do ? 
well , that's basically what we do . 
uh , about every three months or so , we reevaluate our budget 
and we sit down and just write from the largest bills down to the smallest 
 and then we divvy them up between our four pay checks . 
i work part time at night 
 and my husband works full times days 
and so we have four checks , 
but that works out nice because we get paid every week 
and then , uh , we don't have a lot extra for extra spending , 
 ear marked . 
all allocated out . .
every penny is ear marked 
but , uh we have found that works the best 
all the major bills up . 
in fact , we found it easier to divide the major bills up , you know , cut the house payment in half and cut the loan payment in half , 
and divide those up between all , 
all the checks , 
and so we are not taking a huge sum out of one 
and then the next pay check we're real short 
we found that , uh , 
that's true . 
spending , uh , money for things that , you know , 
we kind of tended to eat out a bit more 
 and it was easy to , uh , let things get out of hand . 
we  , uh , thought it to be really helpful . 
we have gotten some of our loans paid off really 
well , it helps you to focus where your money goes 
the same frustration before you got on a budget , 
but you're wondering when you put down all the money that you do bring in 
that's a lot of money , 
but  , 
where does it go ? 
 and also we have found that if we write down , 
and we did this . 
we are not real consistent with this , 
but we did it for about a month 
and we wrote down everything that we bought you know , every pay check 
 and so we could see where every penny went 
and it was really interesting to see just what you do spend 
and like i say we haven't been real consistent with it . 
we should cause it does help . 
that we've found that helps is , you know , we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit 
it's just to , uh , uh , get up the money in advance and put it in , uh , uh , so long as it wasn't you know , unreasonably high , but for things like food expenses 
 wel , just stick to that , 
that is , 
and it really helpful . 
uh , have you developed a savings plan or i r a s or anything like that yet ? 
uh , completely retire debt for car payments and 
oh , uhhuh . 
we are just at a point where we could start thinking about it 
so  , 
oh that's good . 
that's a good feeling .
well i  , 
a year ago 
 so finally 
 a student . 
so , are you still going to school 
well first of all how old you are ? 
oh , i am twentyseven . 
twentyseven , 
well , i am quite a bit older than you are .
i think exercise is extremely important 
and i do exercise on a regular basis . 
you do ? 
what type of exercise do you do ? 
well , i do , uh , jazzercise 
oh you do . 
are you familiar with it ? 
it's , uh , you know , a national company 
and we have a jazzercise center here in plano that has classes like all day long 
so you can , 
are they different from aerobics 
or is it the same thing ? 
you warm up 
and then you have thirty minutes of aerobic activity starting , you know , slowly and then working up to , uh , you know , a high heart rate 
and then you gradually go down again . 
and you do that every day 
oh , okay . 
the minimum they want you to do is three times a week . 
and this is a club 
or , uh , do you belong to a group ? 
i mean it's called a center 
and you buy as many classes as you want to at a time 
and then you just go in whenever you can . 
so , like i usually choose to go at nine thirty in the morning or a nine fifteen class or a ten thirty class in the mornings . 
do you go with friends 
or do you go alone ? 
and that's one of the frustrating things cause i can find very few people to go with me 
 and most of my friends that are my age don't exercise 
or they might play tennis 
 and since i am not a tennis player , uh , you know , i don't get that , 
but i am in my late forties 
 so , uh , there aren't many people , you know , that want to do that . 
most of the people that are in the classes are young mothers . you know , with children between the ages , 
oh yeah 
young mothers or , 
you know , young women ,
well , what do you do ? 
uh , i really don't have a routine . 
i like playing basketball . 
we just bought a new home with a basketball hoop 
oh , great . 
do you play every day ? 
when my wife lets me . 
well , now who do you play with ? 
do you have friends that play with you 
or just , 
and , uh , that's about it . 
i use to play soccer a lot in high school , 
but when i graduated i haven't done much . 
i don't have a problem . 
i know i have to do more aerobics , 
but i don't have a problem with weight . 
i could eat all day and not gain an ounce .
well see , really good 
and i think that keeps some people from exercising . 
i mean , i don't have a problem with weight either , 
but i think i don't have a problem because i exercise .
you do exercise . 
you do it  , 
 but i also watch what i eat .
but you'll come , 
being twentyseven , you don't really have to worry about your heart rate and that yet 
and i 
 but as you get older you will . 
 well everyone's told me my waist line is going to expand one of these days , 
well , it might not .
because everybody's been telling me that too 
and so far it hasn't happened , you know , 
and i just feel like , you know , weigh yourself 
i guess i enjoy sports a lot 
so that's why i've kept active in that way . 
but you don't play any other sports but basketball ? 
uh , basketball , 
volleyball , uh , 
too bad it's not really heavy as far as recreation or hobby , 
i do that . 
but , do you ski ? 
being in utah , i was wondering if you ski . 
 uh , i use to , 
but it got too expensive , 
oh did it really ? 
cause i know that skiing in utah is suppose to be great . 
a lot of people do that 
 i never find the time . 
i had rather do other things . 
well , i have never skied before , 
but i have friends that go to utah all the time 
and they think it's really 
 oh they come up here . 
 and they ski . 
i guess there's a place where you can ski , 
well is it tahoe ? where you ski from , 
that's nevada to california 
that's in nevada . 
i am thinking about where you can ski over the state line . 
oh , yeah 
but there is a place in utah called a funny name . 
there's snow bird or alta . 
but it's like , oh , heavenly . 
is that it ? 
i think it's called heavenly . 
huh . i've never heard of that one . 
you've never heard of that ? 
well , maybe it isn't in utah . 
but they said they've skied heavenly 
and you know , that they skied really well , when they are actually talking about a place . 
it's kind of funny . 
do they exercise much i mean for skiing ? 
i know when i went , you can get sore easily 
oh yeah . 
you can get really sore . 
i know you , 
i mean i've talked to people , 
but most of these people ski enough so that they don't get sore . 
oh yeah . 
  is one or two timer a year if i do go on them 
and i am really sore after . 
and then , is it your quadriceps that are the worst ? 
in your legs and , 
my legs really , really ache . 
but , that's , 
i am using muscles that i have never used before . 
and it's strange that you can do , like i did aerobics , you know , all the time 
and then i went horseback riding 
and still i was so sore 
and i couldn't get over , 
actually , to tell you the truth , i think , uh , jury selection is a , uh , prime , uh , discussion topic in terms of possible improvements on , uh , uh , finding of , uh , guilt . 
uh , i certainly can't argue with that . 
definitely does need some improvements . uh , 
and the lawyers can throw people out for no reason whatsoever just because they want to . 
i think there's a limit on that . 
uh , the , uh 
i think it's ,
but you can , 
i can't remember which . 
i was on a jury trial last year 
only i got kicked out as , uh , the last selection that the , uh , defense got . 
um . yeah , 
it seems to me i'm always challenged peremptorily also when i go to these things . 
i think i have a severe demeanor or something . 
that , uh , 
but , uh , typically , uh , everyone gets involved in , uh , the jury process 
but it still has to be a group of your peers . 
so , if it's your peers and you're not educated 
so if you're a 
you want 
so , that's why the defense is there picking through them , whereas at the same time , uh , the prosecutor sitting there picking through them because he wants somebody who will give him , uh , a guilty verdict if the facts warrant . 
so , uh , i think the jury selection process is pretty neat , 
but i don't think that the jury ought to be the ones picking the punishment 
i think that should be left up to people who have some knowledge in the subject and more knowledge than a jury would have . 
 and many times i've seen on trials they have on t v , the jury will make a recommendation as to leniency or as to the death penalty or whatever , 
but i think that it should be up to the judge and the , uh , lawyers to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be . 
maybe just the judge because they're the people who know what the system is 
uh , and i think that would provide a more fair sentencing procedure .
matter of fact , i've heard that , 
well , preceding criminal record , according to the judicial process has nothing to do with the current crime . 
but when it comes to , uh , sentencing for punishment , of course , if the person's never done anything bad before , according to the judicial system , then they're going to lean towards a slightly more lenient side , 
and the jury's supposed to be notified of criminal records when it comes to sentencing by jury . 
oh , is it ? 
oh , i didn't realize that . 
at least in california , they're supposed to be . 
not during the trial , 
during the trial as to whether they're guilty or not has nothing to do with their background . 
but when it comes to what kind of sentence you're going to lay down , i think uh , that they should . 
i don't know that they always have because i never sat all the way through a jury trial . 
they get too boring . 
so , what you're saying is this , if there is the second offense , then you execute them . 
well , if it's a second offense , the punishment should certainly be more severe than a first offense , because obviously , the rehabilitation process did not work the first time . 
so you got to give them either more time in the system or a different process that will hopefully work better . 
when it comes down to things like alternative sentencing , i'm all for that for , uh , small crimes , infractions and misdemeanors or parking tickets or traffic tickets that have gone to warrant , 
you give them the option of working off their time doing civil service sort of things . 
what about , uh , white collar crimes like , uh , theft of trade secrets . 
i think those ought to be punished a whole lot worse than they are . 
oh , really ? 
like what ? 
well , uh , say , embezzlement , right . 
you get a guy down the street who comes up , uh , carrying a kni , 
uh , with regard body of law . 
and uh , that would be handled differently were 
so they can really do much of anything to change it . 
what do you think ? .
 uh , i don't think so . 
possibly in the jury selection would be the only , 
just for example , what we're seeing in california i guess . 
it makes you wonder , uh , had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome . 
 well won't , 
well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that 
but then 
and , you know , the 
  that's bad  .
 and they didn't get beat up .
 it   , 
rodney got beat up because selfdestructive behavior . 
and , uh , uh , just like the burning and looting 
 oh , yes . 
and they're going to rebuild 
and it'll be even better . 
hey , what do you think , 
you know , some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area ? 
that's right . 
with everybody with that mind set . they're 
they're only going to suffer . 
and you might even be able for a bombing test site , you know . 
with their looting and violence . 
uh , i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or , uh , don't live there or whatever , we all saw the same thing on the tape 
and , uh , 
well everybody is saying this is going to be a new era 
and we're going to reexamine this thing . 
they're a bunch of animals , you know . 
how can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything . 
forty deaths . 
i mean there are forty people 
i know . 
it's really ridiculous . 
and i'm just trying to determine , you know , getting the hell beat out of him against , you know , forty deaths . 
against forty other people being , 
and there's no other , 
i'm not exactly sure , uh , what the circumstances surrounding the deaths . 
and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths 
those deaths . 
is it a looter that got shot by a store owner ? 
i , you know , 
you know , in the street . 
  or beaten . 
rather than stop . 
no one 
that's exactly how i feel too . 
anything had i seen them coming . 
but i was just wondering since the bigger cities than we are in idaho here . 
i'm inside the beltway . 
i'm inside the beltway 
and i don't think like that . 
i'm a government employee . 
in what , uh , section of the government do you work ? 
i'm with the f b i . 
oh , that's interesting .
oh , i see .
uh , around here we have a program where , uh , we separate the bottles and the cans and the plastic stuff from the newspapers . 
and we keep the newspapers in a , 
they're collected twice a month and the trash in a little blue bin that's picked up and sorted out into a truck . 
so they actually have about three passes at this collection . one for 
but i gather you do not separate , uh , the bottles and cans . 
they do that on the truck . 
they separate them as they , you know , dump them . 
and , you know , one guy comes around with his truck and dumps it all in there . 
and i think they're running out of , uh , you know ,   .
the sanitary landfill , i think , uh , is , you know , running out . 
of course , uh , you being from new mexico , you've probably been to washington . especially if you're , your present location . 
you must have come to washington at least once . 
not only have i come to washington but , uh , i find it very amusing that , uh , the thing that was just instituted here is very similar . 
that is we also have blue bins . 
we also separate newspapers from all of the other stuff which goes into the bin and gets separated in the truck and , uh , landfill space is , in deed , the driving factor here . 
and , in fact , uh , despite all of our open space out here , landfill space is still , uh , very hard to come by . 
my , you've got a lot of nothing out there .
they got , 
i mean you could use for landfill .   .
but if somebody can make a regulation about it , they will . 
well in los alamos ? 
well , uh , 
other than nuking it . 
um , in fact , los alamos , uh , has , uh , done a fair amount of research , uh , in recycling things in general . 
um , uh , and purify the waste of specific , uh , uh , nasty elements . 
well , that's pretty , uh , upscale , uh , trash , uh , uh , situation . 
i don't think anybody around here would understand all the , 
uh , uh , they've , uh , looked at , uh , plutonium and uranium and , uh , some other similar things to 
and , again , this is driven by all of the documentation and , uh , e s and h , uh , uh , considerations that , uh , people are , uh , worrying about , i think , much more than they should . 
back when i was in graduate school , i did all of the recycling of the , uh , paper from the computer center 
and , uh , in fact i think i was the first person in our department to have my thesis published on recycled paper . 
well that's certainly , uh , you know , uh , getting into the swim of things . 
everybody gets , you know , five pounds of garbage that they can throw away , you know . 
uh , but more than that every week , uh , you've got to pay by the pound . 
i think 
i think that's a wonderful idea . 
the only alternative i would see is , uh , and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain . uh , if you did it by volume rather than by weight 
and it would 
uh , uh , and limiting the volume is probably a little bit closer to the real problem than limiting the weight . 
well , of course , probably are far more efficient in packing than any kind of little household compactor . 
well my exercise program consists of , uh , you know , 
it's a opportunity to stay alive really .
and what i like to do is i like to stretch out 
and i like to run , uh , m , 
i like to run , get my heartbeat up . 
i like to run two and a half miles . 
and then i like to work out at the holiday spa . 
i think that , you know , 
i've had a regiment now for about , you know , ten , fifteen years of doing that 
uh , it's a lot of work 
but i think uh , to stay healthy , you know . 
i have a sedentary job 
and , uh , unless you do something like that , you're going to get sick . 
i need to get , 
i'm pretty bad about that . 
i'm lazy . 
i should , i know 
start running 
and i'm going to try and do that this summer . 
because i never have time . 
i always put it off . 
by the time i get back from classes it's late at night 
and i don't feel like going back over to the gym and running on the track or whatever . 
because i'm getting a gut here . 
i got to get back into shape . 
well , uh , two years ago i started having trouble with my knee . 
and , uh , you know , i've got , you know , 
well reduce my program 
and i've gained fifteen pounds . 
and so , uh , you know , it's , e , you know , 
i need to get back into swimming , you know , instead of running . 
or i can't run , i should be able to swim . 
well i'm such a terrible swimmer 
and to this effort . 
but if it gets longer than that i start not doing anything . 
so i got a real problem in that regard . 
uh , it , 
you obviously are not an exercise buff or else you'd be out there doing it . 
i mean , i do it , i guess , 
i'm going to do it , uh , because i want to get in shape . 
i'll probably , 
i mean once i get into it and a chore to me . 
well , it's always a chore . 
 i mean 
 and now i'm fiftyfive . 
and , uh , you know , some piece of nonsense . 
you know , some health related thing is going to blow me away . 
that's the same way , 
i got too much weight on right now . 
i need to lose at least twenty , you know . 
but , uh , you know , it's just , uh , i'm busy . 
i'm doing a lot of traveling 
and , uh , it creates a problem , uh , you know , when you're on the road . 
uh , uh , what other programs other than say running ? 
have you ever done anything at all ? 
uh , situps 
or , also last summer i was doing nautilus 
or last year i'm , uh , belong to a club right here . 
that was a little bit too much money . 
but , uh , doing a mix of nautilus and free weights . i like that . 
 what club are you with ? 
i'm sorry ? 
it's called , oh , what was it called . ity sports , downtown washington . 
oh . okay . 
so you're downtown . 
i go to george washington university . 
you're down there on , you know , twentieth and eighteenth and 
it's    , uh , plaza . 
well , i'd , uh , 
well on k street , i think . something like that . 
but , uh , i go to the holiday spa here in alexandria 
and that's pretty good . 
but , you know , evening time it gets pretty busy . 
but generally , you know , i can get in and get a program , you know . 
but , uh , you know , uh , to doing this 
and , uh , i got a problem , uh , you know , ever since my knee went bad , of getting back solidly into it . 
i mean , i've been doing this for fifteen , twenty years . 
i know it's going to bite me in the ass 
and so want to , uh , you know , back off on it . 
it's something , 
i think , uh , i'm young , 
i should get started getting into shape . 
i don't want to , 
i want , 
i mean at one point it's going to be too late to do it .   .
 well , no . 
when you're young ,
and you can recover . 
uh , when you get to be my age and you start abusing your systems , you get blown away .
 uh , and so the object , 
and , uh , for me that's mostly newspaper and radio , 
i almost never watch television , as a matter of course 
so , i don't get news from television , 
except during the war ,
well , why was c n n the only , 
of course i think , saddam hussein only allowed c n n to broadcast it , 
is that not true ? 
it was unusual not to have the different sources , you know , of news coverage . 
um , i don't know . 
i guess , uh , i don't even know why i watched c n n . 
i guess , i just wanted more news . 
it's one of the few times i wanted more news than . 
well , i know even if you watched a b c , n b c or the other , 
i mean , what's the other one , uh , c b s . 
c b s . 
they all were tapped into c n n . 
were they ? 
that's the only thing they broadcast 
and like you i listened to radio on my job at work . 
and all this week they have been having uh , why c n n was 
well , i listen to a christian radio station . 
and they were saying that c n n is definitely a world , uh , news service 
and , uh , they , 
it was , 
you can't really be sure of the quality of what you've got , you know . 
uh , we had uh , some people from our church went to israel , uh , just for a , uh , tour sort of thing . 
and i was watching on tv 
they broadcast this terrible riot 
supposedly that was going on in jerusalem , 
and so it really made me question as to how do we know , you know , uh , if the news we're getting is any good . 
so  , 
i guess , the news just focuses on major events that probably ,
but , uh , i'm from california 
and i can remember being uh , in these earthquakes 
and , i mean they were , 
but they get all blown up in the news . um , 
well i find it depressing to watch our , 
specially tv , you know , 
it's just , uh , 
local news concentrates , on murders and things like that . 
i'm from dallas 
and , uh , we have a lot of bad stuff , uh , 
it just really gets me depressed ,
so then , you wake up one morning 
and you are in war with somebody 
you don't even know about it . 
well , what newspapers , uh , do you read in dallas ? 
uh , we have the dallas times herald and the dallas morning news , 
but i don't read newspapers .
don't you ? 
how come ? 
i find it hard to , uh , follow from one page to another . 
it's just something i have never developed , uh , an interest in . 
and i live in kind of a bad area where if i have the paper delivered it's stolen before i can get out and get it .
gosh that sounds pretty bad to me . 
i mean who would steal a newspaper ? 
you would be surprised . 
they just come by and pick them up even if it's just for the tv , you know uh , selections of the day . 
i see . 
i don't know . 
it just wouldn't be there whenever i tried it . 
so , you're right , 
who would steal a newspaper ? 
 but , they do . 
what part of california are you from ? 
uh , from los angeles , 
but i live in raleigh , north carolina , right now , 
that's where i am speaking to you from . 
oh , okay . 
but , i grew up in l a . 
i work out here . 
huh , you work for t i ? 
i work for north carolina state university . 
but , uh , i know some people at t i , 
and i have a couple of students who have graduated and gone to work for them . 
so , i'm in the computer business . 
well , i , 
boy , current events is not a good subject for me . 
i don't keep up with it that often . 
i mean i've never . 
oh , really . 
so i don't know , 
i see . 
well , all right . 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you too . 
all right , 
well , i guess i would first identify myself as middle aged 
and therefore ,
uh , i , am quite positive on the things that i have seen happen recently relative to women both in society and in the work place , 
uh , there's no doubt about the fact that when i was first graduated from college the impression was that a woman's career would consist of a childbearing years and perhaps a return to the office , but not necessarily . 
uh , now i think the change that i've seen as much as anything is one where couples , uh , are more carefully planning their intention on how to both share homemaking duties and also how women will , uh , have their children and then deliberately sort of plan how they go back to the work place . 
and i guess that's a significant change that i've both participated in and noticed . 
i agree , uh , 
the equality of , uh , the roles now between the sexes , i guess has been dramatically demonstrated with this war , especially compared with , uh , the vietnam war 
and you see women going off to wars as well as men . 
uh , i have wondered why they allowed , or let , you know , both the father and mother go , uh , 
and the children are left without either parent . 
now to me that's kind of a drawback . 
but , uh , i guess it's a price you pay . 
and i also wonder about the children that are being brought up in the , uh , uh , day care centers . 
wonder about them in what way ? 
well , uh , from what i understand there's been studies that , uh , these children are , uh , more rebellious . 
uh , they term it as more , uh , creative .
so , uh , kind of a , uh , community ,
i have not , to be honest , had much experience ,
i guess one knows one's own  storly  
and i know , uh , in my children's case it was one where , uh , pretty much up until the older of two was uh , let's see , i guess basically starting junior high 
and the younger was in fifth grade when my wife reentered the work force . 
uh  , 
so they , 
so i guess my experience is just with what we did 
and so they didn't really go through the child care route . 
they were able to be home together . 
uh , and we never actually experienced that . 
the next generation or so , i guess i anticipate , uh , an increasing equality , uh , greater presence of women in management roles 
 uh , i don't know whether there will be an increased amount of surrogacy that we see . 
i just don't know . 
what do you mean ? 
uh , deliberate childbirth by surrogate mother . 
oh , yeah . 
sort of rentamom , 
you know , 
that's strange . 
a nanny , sort of ? 
and you know , i could envision a society where that would happen and make an interesting , uh , uh , story or whatever . 
i don't think i have a philosophical problem with that . 
in fact , i think it sort of raises nurturing and being a mother to what it ought to be which is a respected profession . 
that's right , 
uh , on the biological urges involved relative to being a mother or not . 
uh , my sense is that i have very much an interest and had one in being a parent . 
i don't know that i , uh , felt myself necessarily encumbered with the necessity to have heirs . 
uh , i don't have boys , 
that didn't bother me , 
never has . 
vision more women deliberately raising children either in surrogacy nanny as you put it , uh . 
maybe we'll see a growth in that where someone makes a career out of , say , taking care of five or six children as opposed to day care . 
it would be a sort of day care , 
but it would be more of a family setting . 
uh , i know that there are young people , characterized , i guess as being half my age , so by definition that means ,
to come in and live with them ? 
i could easily envision that . 
or to put their child into a home setting , 
uh , i have acquaintances of mine where i know that they are paying figures the experience they want 
and i would imagine if there are more of people like that with an opportunity that's a possibility of a change 
and then you might have more control over , uh , the morals that they would be taught rather than in like a classroom or a day care center . 
i know the day care centers are not cheap either . 
you know they're , 
i haven't ever really looked at them . 
are you aware at all ,
uh , well , no , 
i know several single mothers who absolutely can't afford it . 
they have to go with more or less . 
but i think it's like , about sixty dollars a week for two children 
and you have to pay that whether you're on vacation , you know , and taking care of the children or if the children are at home , 
i mean , that is , you know , just a rate that you have to pay 
and , uh , 
what do you envision for the next twenty years as far as women in american society ? 
that's okay , too . 
i think that they will be more in the work place because , uh , the door's open . 
and , uh , it's just human nature to walk through an open door . 
and i would be glad to see that . 
i hope i don't see a lot more single moms , 
i'm noticing that , too , 
emerging called solo parents ,
and that is a little troublesome .
it's awful . 
uh , and maybe that's a change we'll see . 
we'll let the man take care of the children perhaps ,
 well , i think we're about done . 
thank you very much . 
uh , goodbye . 
it's been interesting . 
you take care . 
mostly freshwater , 
i used to fish , uh , when i was real young , down in galveston with my parents , 
and i never really got into that too much , because you have to get in the boat really to do anything , 
and i didn't know anybody who had a boat now , 
so i don't fish too much in saltwater . 
most of my fishing has been in the saltwater .
oh , really , 
oh , neat , 
 and , uh , i have caught one or two small sharks 
oh , really . 
 and , uh , yes . 
what'd you do with them ? 
put them back .
you didn't get a big kick out of killing them like some people do ? 
but , uh , the ones i caught were never large enough to really do anything . 
do they have a limit on sharks , 
i mean , is that like a sport fish , 
can you actually catch those 
and there's no limit . 
i have no idea . 
i know , i , 
my home is in , uh , pensacola , florida 
 so , you know , in the gulf 
 and , um , there's a certain period of time during the year i guess from galveston to mayport they have , uh , shark tournaments , 
and , you know , there's part , 
either as part of or separate from the , uh , bill fishing tournaments they usually have 
oh , really . 
i think i've been trout fishing once . 
i've never fly fished . 
have you fly fished ? 
uh , no 
i don't know that i could do that . 
that looks awful tiring .
i've tried it 
did you . 
didn't like it ? 
i could never get the hang of it . 
it looks complicated to me . 
it's a rhythm or something .
i usually ended snagging my , uh , fishing partners or .
catching tree bass , 
almost got an owl once . 
did you .
that would have been something . 
but , uh . 
so do you fish mainly for trophies 
or do you eat what you fish . 
oh , no , 
 you know , there are people who fish , 
and then there are people who catch . 
well , i'm a fisher .
i've never caught that much , 
but , uh , 
oh , and occasionally we'd go out on a , you know , full day trip , you know , three or four other people 
or , you know , i've caught a few worthwhile snappers , red snappers and gray snappers and so forth . 
that's nice . 
what about you a , 
well , most of my fishing is done at , um , area lakes around here , freshwater lakes 
 and , um , most of it , 
i haven't been really in a long time . 
last time i went i actually was in galveston trying to saltwater fish 
and it just wasn't working with my freshwater tackle . 
that was real fun . 
 um , but , um , i went fishing at , i don't know if you've ever heard of , uh , lake worth . 
it's a fairly new lake in texas . 
oh , yes . 
and , uh , we went fishing there last memorial day , *[[memorial day
and i caught my first bass that was actually big enough to keep . 
i was so excited . 
and , uh , that's really about it . 
mostly just the lakes around here , 
and i fish to take home and cook .
i don't get too much joy out of just sitting and watching . 
i get a little bit of relaxation from it , 
but mainly um , i want to say i brought something home . 
i was out there for a reason .
the last time i went , uh , bass fishing , 
i was with my daughter , a friend of hers , and , well , a friend of mine and his daughter . 
i was the only one who did not catch ,
my daughter caught fish , 
his daughter caught fish , 
he caught fish . 
everybody but you . 
i did not even , 
i was out on a party boat a few years ago , 
and we were grouper fishing , 
or , you know , actually we were , uh , snapper fishing . 
everyone on the boat was catching snappers except guess who . 
it had to be you . 
couldn't catch one to save your life . huh . 
that's right , 
i would go from one side of the boat to the other , 
and , uh , 
even he started baiting my hook  ,
how funny , 
just hoping maybe , he could pull .
and it was really , really , really bad . 
uh , as i said , i am a fisher , 
i'm not a catcher . 
but , uh , i enjoy it though . 
i don't really get out as much uh , as i would like too . 
and they do , of course , you know , 
here in , 
we're , you know , forty five minutes to an hour away from the eastern shore here in maryland 
 and they do a lot of fishing there . 
of course what i used to like to do though is go snorkeling for scallops 
oh , yeah , 
that would be fun . 
and , uh , that i was able to do , when i could go in and go down and actually pick them off the bottom . 
hand picked .
that right .
the weirdest fishing experience i ever had . people to this day are still trying to figure out if i really caught what i think i caught . 
we were in , uh , rockport , which is close to corpus 
 and we had been fishing in a canal , 
they had all these canals up through this one little retirement area , 
and , uh , we'd been fishing in the canals 
and all we were catching were catfish , 
and we were pretty bored with that . 
so , we thought well , maybe there are some crab in here , 
we'll try to catch some crab . 
so i got my chicken   and all my little net and everything , 
and something , 
i had a rock to weight it down , 
something grabs and just runs with it . 
and of course there's no hook , 
so it can't be a fish . 
i'm sure it's not a fish , 
and crab , they don't bite like that , 
they don't just run with your food . 
so , i netted it , 
and it was the ugliest fish i've ever seen in my life . 
it had real teeth , like human teeth , 
and it looked archaic . 
i had no idea what it was . 
i called my father long distance just to describe the thing , 
and it had the rock in its mouth , not the chicken , 
but the rock itself 
they say it's a dog fish , from everything i've described , 
it was brown with these little white dots 
 and it made a loud , almost a croaking noise like a croaker does 
it was the strangest thing . 
oh , i'll never get over that . 
to this day i don't want to get in the water ,
well , we used to , 
i guess the weirdest thing i've ever caught is , uh , in some of the inlets and the rivers around   delaware . 
they have a fish that's called an oyster cracker . 
i don't know if you've ever heard of it 
 and it has a huge strong mouth , 
and they actually , uh , use their teeth to open oysters . 
that's where it gets its name , obviously , huh . 
and this is the ugliest ,
 i mean , and they come in all si , you know , 
i've caught them from , you know , three or four inches long 
i guess the largest one i ever caught was probably eight or ten inches long , 
but just huge , ugly things 
can you eat them ? 
i don't think i'd want to even if you could if they're that ugly , 
they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them . 
that's like this dog fish , 
it scared me to death . 
it looked like it was something out of the dark ages that just never died . 
well , the first time i went surf fishing was in    , 
and i threw my line out 
and the first thing i caught was a sand shark , which was probably a foot ,
and scared me to death . 
i had never seen anything , 
and then i fished for another half hour or fortyfive minutes , caught a few white fish and so forth , 
and then i felt something relatively heavy , 
and i , 
let's see . 
how do you feel about credit cards ? 
personally , i do not care for them . uh , although i find them a necessity in business and so forth , 
i try to refrain from their use as much as possible . um , for a number of reasons , one of which is the , you know , extreme interest rate on most of them . 
the one i use , uh , of course , mostly , only for business purposes is , uh , you know , american express . 
and , uh , i'm not terribly in favor of them . 
not for my own personal , uh , point of view . 
plus you know , from an economic point of view it has increased our debt 
 uh , at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have heard . 
do you use them frequently 
well , we'll use it . 
but like last year , i think we paid , 
i think it was like twenty something cents interest ,
and i think uh , i think we used it for christmas , 
and we got caught just a few days on our grace period . 
uh , so we'll pay a little interest this year , but maybe two dollars . 
but we don't like to do that at all . 
and , you know , i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly . 
uh , we have several credit cards , though . 
we have a gas card , our visa , and then , of course , the american express , 
and i think we have a couple of department stores . 
but , we use it the same way , 
and , uh , 
i find the one i use mostly , uh , 
aside from the american express , i do use my sears card . 
but , uh , as with the american express , i try to pay it , you know , as it comes in . 
so , uh , 
it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill . 
that's usually how we do it . 
i know to american express 
but , uh , for hotels and so forth . 
uh , but i knew that it was paid .
i knew 
you know , sometimes i would go over , 
but in a big way because 
that's good . 
i don't think we've gone that far    ,
but , i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it , like that ,
well , i found 
oh really . 
plus uh , when they , uh , would send the bill , they would automatically convert to the exchange rate . 
so , now , the only time that got to be a problem was , if the exchange rate changed drastically . 
uh , for example , i remember on one trip to france when i started planning the trip , i think , uh , a dollar was worth nine or ten 
and when i finally got over there , it had fallen , uh , two or three francs to the dollar . 
so the  , 
so , i got caught a little short 
but , uh 
if it were , say sixty or seventy francs a night 
maybe it would be more than that . 
it was more than . 
it would average out to thirtyfive or forty dollars a night 
but then when i got back and i was working for the government at the time 
of course the government was several months behind in ,
so there's a little consternation , you know , in trying to get them to compensate ,
 that was the only time i really got caught short . 
and i , 
well that's good . 
well , from where are you calling ? 
oh , from the dallas area . 
so you're from dal , 
i'm from maryland . 
oh really . 
do you work for t i ? 
well , really . 
um . i wonder how t i got g t e involved . 
well , i know jack godfrey . 
oh , okay . 
i know him very well . 
i've known jack for a long time , 
and i'm also in the speech business . 
oh , okay . 
you have a um , very , 
what's the word . 
your speech is very exact . 
oh . thank you very much .
but , as jack said , i'm one of the old hands in the speech business . 
oh really . 
uh . yes , 
so , uh , you work for t i ? 
oh , really ? 
well , you have a good evening . 
well , you too . 
it's been pleasant talking to you . 
same here . 
take care . 
good night . 
well , what would you have at a dinner party ? 
well , uh , lately , since i have children i've cut down on having dinner parties .
but  , 
uh , i have one recipe for , uh , a really good , um , type of a meatball . 
it's called burgundy meatball 
and it's made with red wine and , 
oh , gosh ,
it's really good 
and you can make it ahead of time and then , um , make the sauce when you're ready um , to serve it . 
that's one of my favorite things to serve . 
well , um , i think it would probably depend on whether this was a formal or a informal dinner party . 
but if it was informal , my first choice would be crawfish . 
oh , really . 
well , i guess being from that part of the country . 
because , i mean , crawfish , everybody over here likes crawfish 
but if it was a formal dinner party i would probably think of something else like , uh , 
shrimp fettucini is real easy 
and it's usually well liked by people , i guess , 
i'm just a seafood fan 
well , how do ,
in fact , i just came back from the grocery store 
and being in texas we don't have too many , you know , people that eat crawfish 
but they had live crawfish ,
oh , yeah , 
um , i mean , you're not supposed to eat them dead . 
i mean , 
because if they are dead for too long , 
you can always tell whenever they're cooked if they've been dead for a long time because their tail straightens out . 
and you're not supposed to eat those because they're bad for you . 
so if you ever go in a restaurant , order crawfish , 
i mean , every once in a while you'll see on , 
i mean , it doesn't happen very often because it's just an accident 
but if the tail is straight on it then , yeah ,
but , um , you just put some cajun , well , lots of pepper 
 and you just boil them 
and they're absolutely wonderful 
but uh , they're a pain to peel for some people . 
once you get used to it they're real easy 
but , plan on those being shot . 
serve it do you shell them and then serve em too ? 
i think for a dinner party 
i don't know 
it depends . 
 like they would shell their own , 
you know , we'd just have crawfish and beer or something 
but there's a , 
that's the best part of the crawfish . 
sucking the head 
but um i don't know 
but you can buy uh the crawfish shells already peeled 'n everything 
and usually you use those like for frying 
but you can go ahead and buy 'em cooked and shelled 
and they're more expensive of course 
does it taste a lot like shrimp 
um yeah 
just um the crawfish i mean it just has a taste of its own 
it also depends on who's cooking it and how much seasoning they use
but um i think that 
and also to get totally off the subject of crawfish lots of vegetables and hors d'oeuvres and stuff like that for a dinner party i think that that really helps 
we have a friend another couple where the husband is the one who cooks
that's what i need 
that's what i wish i had 
but in our family i am the one who who cooks 
and i really enjoy it 
it's gotten a little more difficult with kids 
and um we have them over for dinner
and before i had my second child we sort of had a contest going where
and we 
was really a lot of fun 
i bet 
that got pretty competitive
it did 
uh it was a lot of fun you know 
it something unique you know 
and then we got into different um themes you know um whether it would be ethnic food
uh huh 
it was a lot of fun 
sometimes it might be the candlelight 
and sometimes it might be the picnic out back
and we threatened to make the other two uh make us dinner one time
uh huh 
that sounds right i
it does 
except that knowing them they would probably do something
uh huh 
make hot
that's about how much i can cook
i'm doing a lot more cooking now than i used to 
but that's only because my mom just started working 
so she's tired when she comes home in the afternoon 
so i try to have things cooked for her 
oh that's nice 
i don't know 
not one of my favorite hobbies 
if you have the time 
but you know a lot of times it's too much of a rush really be able to enjoy it 
well um 
whenever we have the big gettogether over at her house she makes this meat ball sauce 
and it has 
i don't know 
they are just kind of like quarter size meatballs 
i don't know what she calls them in 
i'm sure she puts wine in it because um she cooks everything with alcohol 
i don't know 
i would be interested in getting that recipe for you if you have it around 
um it's in the other room 
it's real easy 
one of the unique things in this it's like a pound of ground beef some bread crumbs um an egg um whatever seasonings 
you can just light 
so salt and pepper um and chopped up water chestnuts 
that would be wonderful 
makes them a little bit crunchy 
you need to chop em up real fine 
and that adds something new to it 
and then the sauce is just made with um bouillion cubes
so it's not a thick rich type of a sauce 
it's more of a 
when you use corn starch in gravy like you know when you have um chinese food
and it gives it a bit of a different consistency 
well um how long do you cook the meatballs 
the meatballs um after you form them fry them in a pan until
uh huh 
and then drain off all the grease 
uh then what i usually do is i freeze them 
and then when
probably you have to heat it up for a good oh 
if they're frozen you know it may take a half for them to thaw out 
but then heat them thoroughly in the sauce itself 
let them simmer in the sauce itself 
 and it's real good 
that sounds great 
especially i mean the fact that you can prepare the meatballs so far in advance 
i mean like if 
and then freeze them 
that would be great 
i think i'm going to have to keep that in mind for my future because i
i mean um um i'm sure that i'll be involved in a big company 
and i know that my future husband will be you know 
he's going to be working for chevron
so he's going to be 
um you know i'm sure that dinner parties will
invite the boss over
oh yeah 
i have
so you know my whole job's going to be based on my clients 'n stuff like that 
and have to take 'em out to eat 
but i've been doing a lot of things wrong i didn't know
i got some interesting information about crawfish 
i was in fact 
it's good cause i was curious about that today when i saw those for
you need to try em 
oh they're wonderful . 
i'm sure my husband will be surprised , 'cause we were talking about them the other day before 
so uh , what basketball teams are you interested in ? 
well , i guess i'm a big l a laker fan ,
uh , the college ranks , um , i guess i really , 
of course i try to follow my alma mater , 
that's , uh , b y u ,
but they don't have much of a team usually . 
they're more of a football team than they are basketball team . 
you see them in football on t v once in awhile . 
you never see them on nationally basketball . 
you know , that's true . 
i don't think i've ever seen them nationally on basketball . 
uh , last year they had a really good team , 
  the year that danny aines was there . 
that was about five , six years ago by now . 
so , they made it to the sweet sixteen ,
that's not too bad . 
and that's , 
and they usually lose in the first round . 
how about you ? 
well , i'm , uh , originally from the saint louis area , 
so the only basketball team , pro anyway , in that part of the country is chicago . 
 so , i do pull for chicago . 
i mean , of course , this year is a good year to be fan , i guess , because they're doing pretty good . 
is it the bulls you're talking about ? 
the pro , 
um , as far as college teams , uh , i know it's really easy to say , 
but i've been pulling for , uh , duke for about four years now 
is that right ? 
again being from saint louis , i pull for missouri . 
uh , but they're on , uh , probation this year 
so you can't do much about that . 
 but , uh , 
so , did you watch the , uh , final four this year ? 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , i was very pleased with all three games , because kansas , uh , 
you know , i was pulling for kansas on the other side , 
so it was real nice to have the teams that were there . 
of course , i wasn't really , 
i mean , i , 
u n l v kind of gave me the impression of being uh , uh , oh , i don't know , a macho team , you know , 
they seemed to think they were better than everybody else 
and maybe they were , 
but , um , i was real happy to see them get knocked off . 
i watched that game . 
and , uh , it was a good game . 
oh , yeah . 
it was a very close game , and hard fought game . 
and it just , 
i don't know , 
it looked like u n l v may have had more , uh , talent , 
but , as far as playing together as a team that day , duke seemed to have them off balance . 
and that , uh , they couldn't , 
aren't they more of a running gun team    ? 
u n l v , 
and , uh , 
fast breaks and things and , 
the fast breaks and , 
they shut all that down and made them play half court it seemed 
and , uh , u n l v wasn't used to that . 
of course , i knew whenever u n l v went in at half time ,   
see i don't know if they were necessarily behind , 
but they weren't ahead as much as they normally are . 
uh , and , you know , that meant that they had to play a second half 
and they've not had to do that all year 
and , uh , 
they didn't have to go through some tough games during the year 
when it counts so much . 
that's right . 
i mean duke's schedule uh , it just made them a much tougher team overall , 
and , uh , that had to help them a lot . 
that probably was the difference in that game . 
because it really could have gone either way . down to the end , you know . 
so do i take it that you think though that the lakers uh , 
i don't know . 
probably not . 
 i mean , portland's pretty good . um , 
since kareem's retired ,
and , uh , they've got perkins , 
but i don't think he's really been a super star for them . 
well , he's , uh , 
i don't , 
he to me is not a center , 
he's more of a , 
i think magic does a , 
they'll make it , you know , 
uh , and , uh , uh , boston celtics . 
oh , yeah . 
that sure is . 
it's going to be a great series . 
i think that's going to be one of those uh , that's won by the home team , you know , 
whoever has home court advantage is going to win that one i think . 
one of those two will probably be , um , in there , 
um , let me see , 
where does detroit fit in ? 
detroit's in that same , uh , division . 
so , i don't know , 
those three , 
uh , detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year . 
but as i heard , isaiah came back this week . 
so , uh , that might help them . 
they have the playoff experience , 
oh , yeah . 
 so do , all three of them do ,
oh , yeah . 
you can never count the celtics out when larry bird's , 
that's true . 
they say he's starting to play , 
yeah , but he's been kind of up and down all year . 
uh , one game and he'll be playing to where everything he throws up goes in 
and then the next time he'll , 
so , i don't know , 
i'm not sure about him this year . 
last i've heard is that he's starting to peak right now . 
well that's when , 
oh , any dark horses i , uh , you know , 
well , the dark horses , 
san antonio , 
well , anybody who has david robinson ,
he's got to be pretty much , you know , 
i use to say  akimo lija  was the dominant player , you know , when he , 
against any team he would dominate , 
but robinson's getting up there  where   ,
that's right . 
i mean , it looks like he's going in for a dunk 
and they kind of just scoot out of his way or take a step back , you know , 
nobody's got enough beef , i guess , to challenge him when he's driving hard to the hoop . 
uh , he's , 
too bad the mavericks couldn't get him . 
that's true . 
with roy tarpley they're in big trouble . 
well then , he's gone now 
for awhile anyway . 
well , i thought he was gone period . 
i didn't read the story , 
but i , read that , uh , 
i heard he was suspended .
well , that might have been what it was , 
 but i guess the headlines said something about him , you know , that the mavericks released him or something , 
maybe i misunderstood what they meant . 
um . if they did , they'd still have to pay his contract .
well , yeah 
they may have done it . 
you never know . 
it was a lot of money . 
he was making like , 
i heard on the radio it was sixtythree thousand and change a month . 
that's what he was being paid , you know , 
he wasn't even playing . 
oh , boy , what a good job he had .
 that's what i think . 
he ruined his sweet position .
i'm looking forward to the pro playoff , uh , 
l a , 
who's the other one that's doing so well this year , 
is that portland ? 
portland . 
i haven't seen them on much t v that much at all , 
but all i can do is hear about , 
boy they have the seeing eye . 
what do they have 
walter davis and , 
they've got the two johnson brothers 
or they're not brothers , 
but i mean there's two guys named johnson on their team that are really good or doing good or something , 
i forget how that works . 
phoenix isn't doing too bad . 
i don't think there's any clear pick , you know . 
i guess the two teams that you can't count out are the celtics because of bird , and the lakers because of magic johnson . 
they are two guys that seem to find a way when they , 
when it's on the line . 
uh , so , those are what makes a champion i guess . 
that's true . 
well , it's been nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
all right . 
take care . 
take care . 
now when you babysit , what age group children do you sit with ? 
all kinds , um , 
mostly between the ages of two and ten . 
um , like a few summers ago i kept two children every day for the entire summer 
and , i mean , they became like my children .
i'd think so . 
 um , and they live in an apartment complex 
so we swam a lot 
and we played on the playground a lot 
and then we would go to a movie on thursdays 
and , um , there was always an activity , 
you know , they had their favorite t v shows and things like that that we watched 
and then we took naps 
and , um , i don't know 
it just seems like there was always something to do . 
children are so full of energy . 
and , oh , they just keep you going .
uh , one parent . 
one parent . 
she's just , 
how much time did she spend with them ? 
not much at all .
i mean , i would get there at eight o'clock in the morning , 
the children usually weren't awake by then . 
and she would get home at like five thirty in the afternoon . 
and they would have dinner 
and then it was time for them to go to bed . 
um , now at this particular time the children were two and six . 
but then i also , 
i've been babysitting this child , uh , for about eight years , 
he's nine now 
and , um , you know , i've watched him grow up 
and he's like a little brother to me . 
and it's changed over the years , um , 
we get along a lot better now that he's older . 
and , uh , we do different things now , 
we used to play ball a lot 
but now it's , he likes to watch t v 
and he's into wrestling . 
and , um , i kept him on friday night , 
we went to go see a movie and , um , things like that 
but i feel like , i don't know , when i have children i want to be able to spend a lot of time with them . 
  you say you go to school ? 
and what are you studying ? 
uh , communications . 
well , sounds like your .
oh , yeah , 
um , i don't know , 
seem , when i was growing up my mom stayed at home with me and my brother until we were in junior high . 
and i don't , 
i think it was very beneficial to us . 
i mean , like in the summer we were always in the library programs reading books 
and we went skating a lot 
and , you know , she was just always there for us , 
but nowadays if there are two parents to a family , the mother works just as hard as the father does , 
and the children either stay at home and get into trouble 
or they're stuck in a day care . 
and i just don't want my children to have to be raised like that . 
all my friends , their parents worked all the time , 
they got to stay at home by themselves 
and when i was younger i thought they were lucky because they got to get away with things ,
but now i realize that it was better because , um , they have got into a lot of trouble ,
well , that certainly can happen now if 
you say you're in communications , 
uh , what base of communications would you be most interested in getting in to ? 
well , i'm majoring in , uh , public relations . 
public relations , 
so , 
yes , ma'am . 
and , uh , then you'd be willing to give up your job to stay home or stay with the children ? 
well , i would like to , uh , stay at home with my children for at least the first five years . 
but what i plan to do in the future is , um , go ahead and get my upper education as far as my masters ,
and in that case then i'll be at home when my children are at home , 
but i'd like to stay at home with them until they get at least into kindergarten ,
and then i would be at my school ,
and , um , 
well , that's , uh , is an advantage of being in the education field . 
i spent thirtyfour years in education . 
oh , really ? 
what grade ? 
oh , i started out with college and then went to high school 
and then i preferred the high school age level much better than i did the college ,
 oh , did you ? 
what did you teach ? 
i taught physical education . 
oh , oh , i started out as a p e major ,
i wanted to be a p e teacher . 
i sure did . 
uh , i found that , uh , it was a perfect combination from the standpoint of having vacations off at the same time . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , and it worked out fine from that standpoint , uh , plus the fact that , uh , when i left , uh , 
usually , uh , my husband was seldom home for maybe fortyfive minutes or so 
and then our son , he had to get on the bus , 
and he did get on the bus , 
it was his responsibility 
and he never ever thought of , uh , not going to school he said , in view of the fact that he was certain i had a hot line to his school .
well , i was in physical education then 
and i just kept getting pushed into administration , 
wound up in administration , 
and so , 
and i wouldn't have checked on him . 
however , uh , there are , points both directions in that , uh , from the standpoint of parents working and not working . 
i'm working two jobs , 
they each have their own television , 
they each have their own telephone , 
they each have their own rooms , 
they each have this , 
they each have that . 
that's right . 
they need some attention . 
and , uh , i  think out  
because that is the way of getting attention . 
well , see whenever my mom stayed home with us , we did without a lot , 
i mean , we were , 
it's hard to make it on one income , 
that's right . 
but we did 
and we lived in a trailer for eighteen years . 
and , um , you know , we only had one car , 
we only had one telephone , you know , 
we didn't get to eat out all the time 
but i feel like that it helped me now because i appreciate the value of the dollar , 
and , um , i also had the supervision that i needed while i was growing up , 
and i hope that i can provide that for my child too . 
and uh , we need more of that , 
we need more parents willing to supervise , 
though we've had such a breakdown in the family structure ,
 oh , we have . 
and that i think has contributed much to , uh , the delinquency that  works grant  and the poor school results that we're having . uh , that the students' , uh , parents have just not really taken enough interest in them from the very beginning 
and i think my feeling was that the very best teachers should be in grades one , two , and three . to get the students off to a good start let them have positive , um , uh , experiences ,
it's too late then , 
you cannot ,
it is . 
it's way too late , 
i agree . 
and , uh , while parents very often will be involved with the school activities when the child's in the elementary school 
and they get into the high schools so often they seem to drop away at that point . 
and , that is just as valuable ,
it is .
and the parent really needs to be there for the child . 
and , uh , the child needs to take pride in the fact that their parent is doing something . 
uh , we were fortunate in view of the fact that my son did play football 
and i did keep statistics for his team , 
 oh , great . 
and we tried to be a part of it but not overshadowing him or making him feel that we had to be there all the time . 
so , i feel that i learned a great deal from my students , uh , with regard to what their biggest complaints were with parents . 
and a thing such as , uh , 
one of the biggest complaints i well remember because i spent a lot of time with seniors ,
when i was your age i didn't have this or that , 
and i never ever said that because i knew that that was one thing that was really irritating to young people . 
well , i guess that was good that you were hearing it from other students . 
and i had to deal with their problems 
and i could talk about the kinds of problems which they were bringing that they had just in general aspect 
and our son would share this 
and then he would have to make decisions for himself along those same types of , uh , lines . so that ,
well , um , 
does your son work for t i ? 
in the dallas area 
but when he went away to coll , 
and he was  on the lawns  from the time he was in the seventh grade and , uh , a small   and all the way through college 
and we didn't even know it . 
oh , goodness . 
he didn't even tell us .
but when he graduated he had a five thousand dollar bank account 
and , uh , we had told him that if he ever wanted to go to college he could go , 
if he got married he was on his own , 
if he flunked out he was on his own  . . . 
one year public service for everybody . 
i don't know , 
i've been sitting here thinking , 
well , you know , like , i'm not really sure what i think about this . 
um , uh , i mean , the first thing is , uh , if it's going to be mandatory , it's got to be mandatory , 
i mean , everybody , not just like , you know , poor people and all that , you know . but ,
um , i don't know , 
it'd probably be good , 
i just don't know if , you know , i was eighteen or whatever , i'd want to be stuck doing it for a year or whatever . 
i'm not sure i want an eighteen year old to make that kind of decision . 
uh , i mean , that doesn't sound right . 
um , i guess i see overall beneficial , if we're going from that point of view . 
um . you know , in the past , 
i don't know how old you are , 
but when i was , uh , in high school , it was the beginning of vietnam and so forth . 
and many of my peers were being drafted . 
and i could see that many of them had conscientious objections to war or whatever . 
but in their neighborhood or ,
and i guess i see that but a privilege . 
uh , uh , 
it is , uh , 
since we live here and we all benefit , rich , poor or in between , uh , there are benefits even for those who have it the hardest . i just see that as maybe a good idea . 
i wouldn't mind doing it at fortyfour . 
uh , and i find ways to others . 
uh , and i can't see that as being something to really object to . 
well , i guess it would still depend on how , 
i mean , you know , one year full time , you know , this is what you do , you know . 
you're going to go you know , and , you know , all that stuff . 
i mean , .
i could see a gamut of different kinds of opportunities . 
things that need to be done ,
i can't , imagine what kind of , uh , uh , bureaucracies we'd get into and expense having it be full time , 
oh , you're going to go to this camp 
and you're going to , you know , 
like , um , back in the depression , the c c c ,
it was needed , 
it gave some folks some jobs , 
and we got some great public works out of it . 
but , um , i don't see that as being necessary now . 
i can see it being done , uh , on a regular schedule . 
uh , everybody has to put in so many hours of , uh , public service in a given time , perhaps . 
uh , i guess i see all of us benefiting , 
and i don't see it just relegated to the young . 
but i see so much going on that , that's bad . 
and this would give them a chance to have some positive selfesteem . 
something that they turn ,
and also , you know , you feel more like , you know , you're actually part of the community if you've done something ,
that's right . 
you take pride in that , some positive feedback from those who benefit ,
and or , or at least the area where the person lives . 
uh , definitely . 
it might not be the same neighborhood , but the same city or county , because then you're coming in contact with it . 
it's not as meaningful for me to go to minnesota and do something up there that i'll never be able to see again , unless i happen to go on vacation ,
it almost needs to be something that has more impact for the individual , on going . 
but as far as putting that into work , with the heartache of , first of all , getting it started and figuring out how to do the logistics ,
oh , that would ,
and getting it going . 
i , see a lot of things like , uh , scouting , uh , 
 and i guess , i don't see , uh , this being that different . but even more beneficial because it would be something that everybody participated in ,
do you have kids ? 
in about six months we will .
oh , well good . 
you'll have a little time think about that . 
i guess , i have , uh , 
when i was teaching school i saw so many kids that were at loose ends and that didn't really have a purpose . 
and i can see , you know , some really significant things coming out of it . 
i know you've got to get past that grudge attitude that many have , 
but that would be a part of selling it to the community . 
um , i may , 
well i don't know , 
around here we have a number of community projects that folks just volunteer for . 
boy scout troops or church groups or civic clubs will , uh , police uh a couple of miles of the highway and kee , 
and i've seen it in other states too . 
they have ,
i don't know , 
they've got , um , in most of the states around here i think , uh . 
you know , down in north carolina , there was a big controversy for a while , because uh , 
and , uh , 
and there were those that said , no , 
you can't do that , i'm sure . 
well , uh , it was interesting because that's an interesting question , you know . 
should these people be allowed to or not ? 
i think they finally decided not to because they figured that stretch of highway was going to get trashed .
and i hadn't even thought about the other end of that . 
that's an interesting , uh , situation . 
we had visited relatives in virginia , not too long ago , 
and i thought i had seen , when we were traveling around the state , some similar signs up that indicated that certain sections were being policed and cleaned up 
i think virginia's got it 
and i know maryland does , 
and we went to indianapolis last weekend , and back . 
and , um , i'm pretty sure i saw , yeah , stuff in ohio and maybe pennsylvania , 
i don't remember for sure now . 
and i don't know about your part of the country , 
but , uh , down here in the last , oh , year plus , beginning with last year's earth day 
and i work for texas instruments . 
it's not a good idea . 
but then they lost ,
it's just , a part of everyone's consciousness . 
well , the thing about that is though , it's got a , 
i mean because i mean it was big , you remember , like in the early seventies and all that . 
you know , and then it kind of just went out of vogue . 
and the same thing will happen . 
it's like , you know , environmentalism was really big for a couple of years 
and then people like , well , you know , 
i'd on such and such , you know , 
and even if it's not environmentally safe , who cares , you know . 
i'm sure the pendulum will swing the other way . 
uh , there have been too many other things that it's done that for , just in my life . 
and if you look at history at all , you see that , you know , uh , we go from one side to the other on just about any subject ,
but , it is comforting to me to see , uh , more concern about some of these things that cost us money . 
especially when we have dwindling , uh , resources such as oil that's burning out of control in the persian gulf , and so forth . 
just every little bit does , 
it makes me feel better . 
it makes me feel like , well , there may be something left for my children , my nieces and nephews and so forth . 
well , yeah , uh . 
well , uh , wouldn't , 
it's just probably a good thing that the oil's burning and may , make some people realize that hey , you know , this stuff runs out . 
that's right , because , 
of course , that's probably blasphemy for you to say , uh , coming from where you are in texas . 
uh , no , 
because if , we , 
what was it , seventyfour when we had last oil crisis ? 
and , uh , we started getting smart 
and we were looking all these alternative sources of the energy and so forth . 
and as soon as the oil prices came back down , the pendulum swang the other way . 
and we need those reminders . 
well , my dad's in the solar energy business , 
so , uh , 
but , you know , on the other hand , he voted for george bush , 
so um , you know , i wonder sometimes if he knows what he's doing . 
well , i thi , you know , 
just about anybody you could name , whether i voted for them or not ,
but that's why they're there and not me . 
i don't want the , 
well , the thing with bush  . . . 
i was just trying to think about how i dress for work , you know , 
t i is a very casual atmosphere . 
and , uh , what i usually do on the weekend is lay out five outfits 
and , uh , on monday the worst looking one .
 and then progressively through the week , i'll wear nicer looking things 
and then on friday most everybody wears jeans and sweatshirts , or , you know , jeans and blouses or something like that . 
uh , but mostly what i wear are skirts and blouses or , you know , skirts and , uh , pullover sweaters or , uh , you know , little two piece dress suits like , 
yeah , uh , 
you know , that's a good way to approach it . 
i've never thought about , um , 
i do plan my clothes a week in advance . 
actually , i plan them a month in advance . 
i usually do a month at a time , 
so i don't repeat an outfit . 
but , um , i've never thought about wearing your worst outfit on monday , because really no one's paying attention . 
but anyway , um , i don't work outside of school . 
um , i work in the computer lab at school 
so i can just wear whatever i have on for school , 
um , and really it's , 
i try to dress presentable but very comfortable . 
like , um , in the warm weather it's always shorts and a tshirt or a button up or something like that 
and then in the winter time it's jeans or pants . 
i usually , uh , you know , 
college is so casual , 
you really don't want to dress up unless you , uh , have a job 
and you have to be there right after school or something like that , 
a college campus 
also , i mean there's you know , hundreds of people work for t i . 
and , uh , a lot of people and , uh , sweats all the time 
and they dress up like when customers are coming in ,
and , uh , you know , a lot of people like those that work in the legal department for the real , uh , higher ups ,
 so there's a good combination in the hallways all the time , you know .
well that's good that they're so casual . 
 i mean , uh , my brother works for t i 
and he's a or computer engineer . 
and , uh , you know , whenever he was going to school , he was expecting to having to wear , uh , a tie or a dress shirt everyday . 
but , uh , he goes to work in his blue jeans , tshirt ,
and he just loves it . 
and that's very acceptable at t i . 
i believe at i b m they make you wear a blue suit and , uh , some kind of colored shirt and a tie . 
that's what i've heard . 
i would hate to be in that atmosphere . 
but , uh , i mean , they just moved into the new building , 
he calls it the new building . 
i don't know , 
it's where all the executives are . 
 all the upper level to start wearing blue jeans . 
but , he just left for italy today at four , 
 and he'll be over there until july first setting up some kind of computers for them . 
i see . 
i mean for t i but over in italy . 
oh , t i is everywhere . 
oh , yeah , 
he was so excited about going . 
 that's true , 
that's a good idea . 
because , uh , he didn't , you know , 
he's not really into all that . 
he would wear it if he had to for his job and all 
but , you know , his preference is , um , blue jeans and a tshirt , 
but i think that's great about t i , 
and also , uh , to get off the clothing , the smokers , you know , how they have the , 
i think that's great . 
and if you happen to go into one of areas that is a smoke area and you don't smoke , you almost strangle . 
oh , really . 
do you smoke ? 
 so much smoke in the air . 
the smoking area , you know , it's closed in , 
 and if you don't smoke and you go in there , 
everybody that goes in there smokes 
so it's full of smoke when you go in there . 
i used to smoke a long time ago . 
i think that's , um , 
i used to burn my clothes , talking about getting back to clothes .
i used to burn my clothes with cigarettes . 
that's one of the reason that i stopped .
well , um , you mentioned your daughter had graduated from college . 
well when she was in high school did she always have to have all the new fashions 
and , uh ? 
see that's how i am 
but my mamma was not raised like that 
and so , 
i wasn't either , 
my daughter , she's real good at finding sales though , you know . 
 oh , me to , 
boy i have 
she'll buy a lot of , 
and you know , she finds all the outlets and all the discount places and , uh , buys clothes . 
uh , i didn't sew , 
but now i've learned how to sew , 
so i'm still learning how , 
and i'm getting much better at it 
and i , 
that's great . 
i wanted to take a sewing class at school 
but i just haven't fit it into my schedule yet , 
but i mean , that can really benefit . 
um , that's something that i'd be very interested in learning . 
because clothes are really expensive .
uh , they're outrageous! 
uh , uh , a little simple at the most out of a decent fabric ,
yeah it's , 
just a little shell to go under a suit , you know . 
but , uh , i mean like whenever i was growing up and all , my mom , 
i never understood this then , 
but i do now , 
but she never would buy me like the new designer jeans that had come out that were thirty dollars , 
and she always told me it was because i was still growing 
and she wasn't going to buy me something i was going to grow out of next week . 
especially to pay that kind of money for it . 
i have a friend who , uh , 
a little boy 
and , uh , she used to dress him out of neiman marcus . 
i mean , 
 oh no .
and then , seems like every time she turned around he was outgrowing stuff . 
 and she finally learned that you just can not do this , you know . *[[can not cannot
so now she finds the basement sales just like , you know , everybody else . 
that's the best way to shop . 
i mean , i always thought my mom was being mean to me 
but i look back at it now 
and my child is going to , 
i mean , i'm going to raise mine the same way . 
um , i don't know , 
they're just so outrageously priced , 
it's just incredible . 
and you , 
i try to , uh , always catch the sales . 
and , yeah , 
and you just have to keep buying them , you know . 
the quality is really not that great , you know , for the price that you pay . 
it depends on , um , 
there's always a reason why they're on sale .
so that has a lot to do with it . 
but , um , 
like uh , sweater from , uh , i believe it was ross dress for less .
 and it was really pretty , 
and the top , you know , 
it had , uh , other little things on it 
and i just thought it was so pretty 
and i got it at a real good price , 
i think maybe it was nine ninetynine or something . 
oh , that's great . 
and after i wore it a couple of times i realized why it was , 
uh , oh . 
 in the middle of the back of it , there was , 
it's like there , 
it had been slit 
and they had like just sewed it back together ,
 oh , no . 
wasn't a seam or anything , you know . 
and that's why it was so cheap , although , it's not really noticeable , uh , from the outside , 
and then i was told by somebody that works for j c penney's that , uh , sells seconds . 
the defect . 
um , they don't really buy the first quality , 
they buy the second . 
and , uh , places like j c penney's they'll reject the seconds , 
they'll send them back every time . 
 but places like ross dress for less and , uh , t j max . 
t j max does that , 
we have a t j max over here 
and , um , 
what do you think about it ? 
well , uh , the roles have definitely changed 
oh , yeah . 
um , i think a lot of it has to do with women working . 
i do too . 
i think it's going to , 
like in the future , i think all women are going to work . 
i mean , they may let you off for a day or two to have your baby , 
but that will be it , 
 or either they'll have a computer at home and in the hospital where you you know , just continue right on with your work . 
i mean , it really is coming to that because most women now days cannot afford the time that they could take off unless the company pays them . 
they can't even afford to take off , you know , to have children it seems like . 
you know , society has decided for you how many you can really have and make it . 
uh , because if you have , you know , two , well , if you go to work , you're , just working to pay for day care ,
now , i was real lucky because my husband had a good enough job where you know , when i had them and when they were small , 
 oh , that is good . 
 i mean i didn't work , 
i needed to 
but i didn't . 
steve has a sister who has four . 
she just had her fourth one in , uh , march 
and she doesn't have to work either . 
i don't know how they do it . 
i don't know how people do it with one , 
you know , um obviousl , 
 let me tell you , you go without a lot of things that you wo , you know . 
obviously we don't have any 
i think that's part of the role reversal , is it's okay to get married and not have kids . 
 oh yeah . 
and i don't think it's been until recently that they had decided that two people was a family . 
 you know and , 
 well it's getting where if you're going to give your kids any kind of education and stuff you can't hardly afford to have over two . 
 and i mean it's hard with two , 
now , we , 
uh , my youngest one , 
i have two , 
i have a son and a daughter , 
and my youngest one is going to be graduating from college soon , 
 and if i had a third one ,
because i work now , 
i work full time 
and , uh , you know , it , 
when you put them through college it just takes just about everything you got . 
they get loans and grants and scholarships and stuff like that , 
that helps out , 
but still , it cost a lot . 
oh , yeah , 
i mean , just you know , the cost of living and loans don't pay for groceries and stuff . 
and cars and all their books , 
and the books are outrageous .
oh , i know , 
and they're getting worse . 
uh , my daughter brought home a book the other day that she was going to have to have for one of her next classes 
and it was like ninetysix dollars . 
 and this book is a little bitty skinny book . 
and , if i'd of probably had three or four children , i don't see how we could have made it , you know , without me working . 
i guess it's always not being able to picture one more , 
but in essence you probably would have worked out fine . 
but i think i would have had to work . 
if i'd of had that many , i'd of had to work in order for my kids to , 
you know , even though he brings in a real good living and everything , in order for me to keep up , i would have had to work . 
but i think it's getting more and more like ,
then you go to work 
and you work , 
 because if you have two or three kids , by the , way the inflation's going i think a woman's always going to have to work 
and it's just going to be an accepted thing . 
there isn't going to be any of this , you know , very few people will ever stay home . 
and that's all right with me , because i don't want to stay home 
 you know , i think i'm just part of the new stuff , that is just , 
i don't know , i think i would just go nuts sitting at home all day long . 
well you know , i can't imagine how i did , because now i work all the time , 
 and , um , well i work all week , 
and i think where a woman thinks that a way , you know , just like , 
now my daughter , there's no way that she can imagine herself married at the age that she's at now .
to her everything is , you've got to go through college , you've got to get a job , you know . 
and then when everything's set up , then you look for somebody that you want to spend the rest of your life with , 
now when i graduated high school ,
 that's what you did . 
and then you got married 
and then you had a family . 
i mean that's just the way it was , you know . 
and , uh , that's like when my mo , 
i know when my mother's age it was always the kids and the family and everything had to come first 
and the woman stayed home and took care of them , 
i like the way it is . 
it's , uh , being , 
see , we're from houston and so it's not so hard for people , 
you know , you've been married three or so years 
and you don't have kids , well it's okay , nobody does . 
but you come to a place like belton , 
and th , 
a lot of the kids here get married out of high school . 
it's real small town , 
and i , 
and a lot of people in our su , 
we're the only couple in our sunday school class , except for one other couple , who are in their forties , 
and they can't have children , don't have children . 
 you know , not everybody has to have kids , 
and , i'd rather spend the time with my husband than , you know , spending time , 
here , it's your turn , you know . 
but , you know , that , now even 
whenever i was coming up and everything 
and we got married right out of high school , well a year after i got out of high school  , 
 and , uh , i didn't have kids for four and a half years 
but that was because i wanted to work 
and i wasn't ready for kids . 
i think that's what it is , 
i'm not either . 
i mean they thought that it was terrible , you know , 
oh , but that , you know , you better just get ready now . 
 well you don't just get ready . 
but i was kind of odd because as a general rule the people that married during my time , they had kids within a year . 
and i just was not ready for kids . 
i wanted to get out and work a little bit 
and i wanted to travel and stuff like that , which we did . 
and , uh , kids didn't fit in right then , 
but , it's getting more and more like that where there's more and more couples 
and , really , if you don't want the kids , then it's not the time to have , 
i don't care what anybody tells you . 
and i think that more and more the attitude's getting that way . 
because that's like my daughter 
now , she says that , you know , maybe when she's thirty she might want a child then . 
 and , uh , even though i'd like to have grandchildren , i can see her point . 
steve's mom that god will take care of us when it's our time . 
but it took every nerve in her body to say that because she's from a very , very old fashioned family . 
and , she stayed home and raised her kids 
and she expected all of her kids to do that too , 
and their wives and , you know , be there at every beck and call 
and , i was raised totally opposite .
how we got together , i don't know , 
 because my mother had six girls , 
and , you know , she worked too . 
 and , i guess i just 
and i saw how life was when she stayed home 
and it was rough , 
it was hard , 
and , uh . 
and it really is , 
i know , 
just like now , you know , there's so much more now . 
all my income goes for things like luxuries , 
i mean , it really does .
but the rest of it 
we just buy things like boats , 
or we go on trips , 
i think you've earned that though . 
i feel like i have , you know , because well , we're just a age now , 
i'm not old 
but , i'm older . 
and , uh , i got to stay home with my kids , which i really wanted to do , 
but now i could not go back and do it . 
and i mean , i did stuff 
and i think it's just the new way that people are thinking . 
i think so . 
but , uh , 
i think it would be neat if they could incorporate into small and large businesses both a built in day cares where the children were there in the facility but not necessarily right there with you . 
well you know more and more of them are , 
i don't know if it is up there where you are 
but where i am , just like all the hospitals ,
are they ? 
but the reason they had to do this was because you know , so many women could not afford , 
like you said if you had four kids , or even if you had two kids , you would be paying all your salary to pay for those two kids to go . 
so , uh , more and more of our hospitals , especially , over here are getting them 
and then some of the bigger companies , 
but it's mainly the hospitals . 
i don't know if the t i in dallas does or not . 
i know nobody around here does , it , 
it's too small around here . 
oh really . 
well , i can go ahead and start and tell you mine 
we're from san antonio 
and that's where i grew up , 
 so i was used to the heat , out here right now , 
 gosh , it gets to about high seventies 
and it gets very cold at night . 
and monterey it's , um , right on the coast . 
and , i don't know if your familiar with california coastline , *[[your you're
but about a two hour drive south of san francisco , 
oh , okay . 
and it's , uh , really nice . 
it's a big area for people to come from the different , uh , countries , mostly like japan , germany and england . 
and they usually go to carmel and vacation on the beaches , 
so it's pretty nice , uh , year round . 
but , uh , warm in the summer , 
but it's stays pretty cold even , uh , during the winter , for as nice as it is . 
and , um , we usually get a fog . uh , right i guess , about four o'clock 
and it kind of rolls in over the coast . 
and , uh , then it usually breaks back off again the next morning . 
and if you go just a little bit ways in , i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas ,
and it gets very hot and dry 
and the fog never makes it that far . 
but along here it's , uh ,  , very different from the texas type weather . 
what's it like down there ? 
well , right now we're we're having the little bit of spring that we have . 
oh , really , 
well at least you've got some .
we don't have many seasons here . 
it goes from winter to summer , usually . 
spring usually consists of a lot of rain . especially thunderstorms . 
we had one of those blow through tonight . 
oh , well , that's good . 
and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days . 
have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree , 
it's gotten up to , uh , ninety a couple of times . 
but , basically , it's been in the low seventies and eighties . 
women , that's good . for this time of year . 
it's not really been too bad . 
usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier . 
so do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
well , the season is just about over for that , 
uh , in fact we drove down to corpus last week 
 and , uh , there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way . 
oh , i miss that .
  drove through san antonio 
and i spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio 
and were , 
they had , 
and we came back . 
what day was that , sunday evening , 
and they had a big rainstorm come through there , part of the same thing we're getting now , i guess . 
oh . oh , well that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued . 
at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas . 
i'm glad to hear that .
that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring . 
we had a pretty rainy fall last year , as well . 
um , we've had a few down here , but not anything like kansas . 
but this is the season for that . 
oh , gosh . 
they do pop up occasionally ,
oh . eah . 
i really don't miss all the heat there . 
i'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings 
so we get a bit of a relief . 
i'm from here originally , 
so when it's july and august , i'm pretty well used to the ,
the biggest problem with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil . 
it's that black clay soil . 
oh . is that what dallas is , 
 you know , it's not sandy like most of the state is , 
so it doesn't absorb the water real well . 
you know , once it rains a little bit , it's filled up and everything else just runs off , 
san antonio has that same problem when the rains come . 
it's a complete mess , everything floods , all the under passes . 
i didn't realize that dallas had that same problem . 
especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years . 
and there's a section in south dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain . 
well , we could use some rain up here . 
we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought ,
and they had a pretty good early spring 
and we got quite a bit of rain , 
but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years . 
uh , so they're still talking water rationing this summer , 
so it would seem strange because in san antonio , 
we had lived out , um , west of san antonio , in castroville , 
 and the water in  medina  lake and that area was really going down , that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing 
and there's no problem with water . 
and then i came here and found out they were in the , you know , four year draught .
so i said , well , gee , this is pretty much like texas . 
and it pretty much is in the middle of summer . 
they have rolling hills around here 
but , um , it's a really nice area . 
it's just such a change from , uh , texas because i had grown up with , uh , the heat , 
 and used to essentially , 
like you said , you have the cold winter 
and then you have the hot summer spring .
and , uh , to come here , it's kind of the temperate weather all year round . 
it's kind of like , uh , spring , i guess , 
and then in the winter 
and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall ,
so it seems like we only have two springs or two seasons 
and that would be spring and fall . 
we never really get any of the other ones . 
but it's a really nice , uh , change of pace . 
i guess i'd prefer that .
to the heat . 
i really don't miss the heat . 
um , we do a lot of , you know , 
when you do a lot of outside , like running and stuff , it's just so much easier ,
and you don't have to worry about the high humidity . 
does dallas get high humidity ? 
or is it pretty dry . 
it's pretty dry . 
we get some when it's this rainy , 
but it's nothing like , i guess , san antonio summers , 
 it's  nothing like houston . 
  or east texas , is a little more humid . 
it seems like san antonio is increasing in humidity over the years , 
because i had lived in san antonio for about twenty years , 
 and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid .
but , um , it's not the same as corpus . 
corpus , you get that humid salty feeling in the air . 
but here , um , well the water is extremely cold , up here , 
you can lay on the beach all you want , 
but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming , you have to wear a wet suit .
and i , 
for some reason , because of the cold , uh , ocean , uh , water , the air is always cool . 
it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling , 
so i really like that about this area . 
and , uh , we just hadn't expected it , 
we were used to , what , uh , gulf coast weather was like ,
it's just completely different 
and it's much nicer . 
probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference , 
it does 
but you , um , 
but we like it 
so it's a nice change . 
so we'll be here a couple of years 
that's nice . 
so it's been good . 
well , my wife's originally from virginia 
and we lived there for about nine months 
and that was a real change for me . 
oh , i imagine . 
um , parts do . 
we're over in the western edge in the mountains . 
and , they have , of course , some pretty severe storms , winter storms , snow and that type of thing . 
but they're so good about clearing the roads , that , you know , it doesn't usually bother you very much . 
not like texas where everything comes to a stand still . 
their springs and summers are pretty mild , too . 
it never gets real , real hot . 
i'll have to try that out because i had heard that north carolina was sort of like that . 
and , uh , i've just never really been in that region of the country 
and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like . 
because a lot of people that are from that north carolina region really like it . 
and , uh , they get the snow , 
but they said it doesn't really get messy 
and it doesn't really hang around that long . 
so , the people i know that are from there , uh , they always miss it 
and they want to go back .
nothing seems quite as good . 
but , anyway . well , 
well , as we were talking the weather came on 
and there's a flash flood watch and ,
 oh , geewhiz . 
oh , gosh . 
well , i hope it moves up this way , 
but i'm sure it won't .
maybe we can send you some .
because we could sure use it . 
well , i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and , uh , 
well , i enjoyed talking with you lisa , 
good luck to you . 
you , too . 
we'll see you . 
well , what movies have you seen recently , valerie ? 
let's see , 
the last one we saw was thelma and louise . 
oh , we haven't seen that one yet . 
well , don't bother .
 oh , it wasn't that good . 
well , oh , from a woman's point of view it was very , uh , chauvinistic as far as women go . 
uh , it was entertaining , 
but , yeah , 
i don't think the general audience would go for it . 
the most recent one that , uh , my wife and i have seen was the city slicker . 
how was that ? 
that was excellent . 
it was 
that is one i've been dying to see . 
at the same time , it had a story line about people trying to find themselves . 
there were parts that were sad . 
i mean , it just ran the gamut of emotion . 
all around entertaining . 
how long did that movie run ? 
uh , it's still on , to the best of my knowledge . 
but , i mean , time wise , how long , 
was it 
uh , i think it's less than two hours . 
we rented one recently that seemed to go on forever .
but this one , it was fairly long . 
i'm guessing probably an hour and fortyfive minutes , maybe . 
and , uh , it , 
but excellent acting by billy crystal and 
was it , oh , good . 
 uh , who was the , 
oh , jack palance had an excellent part in there as the old cowboy . 
oh , great . 
so we really enjoyed that . 
oh , well , i'm looking forward to seeing that one . 
that was next on our list , 
so , uh , 
i think that , uh , i can highly recommend that movie to see . 
good deal 
do you rent movies very often , 
uh , we generally rent a couple a week . 
uh , in order to get a decent movie to have on a weekend , you've got to rent it on thursday . 
they get 
that's exactly right . 
we will rent two or three movies on thursday 
and , uh , with luck , you'll have one or two that are good . 
most of them are a coin flip .
 oh , gosh . 
and we usually have , oh ,  , we don't get out as much as we like . 
we have two children , 
so we occasionally get out to the movies 
 but , uh , it's a fun thing to do to get out and 
yeah , well , 
quite frequently , we have our grandchildren on the weekends 
 and , uh , we'll try to rent something that they can see as well as something else that we can see 
what ages are they ? 
have you found 
uh , the oldest is nine , 
the youngest is three . 
he doesn't really pay attention . 
the five year old doesn't have the attention span , either . 
but the nine year old will watch anything that's on t v .
 uhoh , uhoh , yeah . 
they have been doing that . 
we've been waiting for a good movie out this summer for the kids to see . 
the last one they saw was home alone 
and , uh , they enjoyed that , 
but , uh , i missed that one . 
my husband took the kids to see that one 
my wife took , uh , i think the kids to see that one , 
well , that's a good deal . 
uh , oh , we saw this movie , 
presumed innocent was the one we rented , uh 
let me think 
harrison ford . 
harrison ford and , how does the story line go ? 
uh , he is a prosecuting attorney 
and , uh , a woman prosecutor in there is murdered 
oh , okay , 
we haven't seen that one . 
 and he's trying to find it , 
but , course , it's one of these with a twist where it looks like he's the one that wound up killing her 
so it's , 
it's over two hours long . 
oh , gosh , 
uh , my wife she likes the suspense movies . 
i enjoy 
i think that's the one i wanted to pick up the other day , 
and then my husband wasn't going to be able to watch it with me , 
so i thought i better save that one for another day .
save that for another day . 
because i think he'd like that one . 
you enjoyed that one , then . 
well , that's a good one to put on the list . 
it's like most suspense movies , 
what was 
it was on t v recently , uh , fatal attraction . 
it's one that , once you've seen it once you really can't see it again 
 so you know all the story and who did what 
at least i don't think so .
i don't think too many of them are anymore . 
it's a shame , 
but , uh , 
i don't know , 
we've watched weekend at bernie's any number of times .
i know .
it's just slapstick comedy .
oh , no .
sit there and laugh , 
and , my one grandson and i , 
my wife can't understand it , 
but we like bill and ted's excellent adventure 
oh , gosh . 
we've heard about that one , 
but we haven't seen that one either 
so , well , it sounds like you and your grandson like the same kinds of movies . 
we like to laugh .
 oh , god . 
i have a theory . 
i like movies for entertainment . 
i don't want to 
i agree , 
life's depressing enough .
that's for sure .
well , i've certainly enjoyed talking with you . 
well , you , too , jim . 
and , uh 
have a nice weekend . 
i hope you see a good movie soon . 
do you enjoy cooking ? 
i'm kind of that way , too . 
i enjoy cooking when i have time . 
i don't enjoy preparing three meals a day everyday .
that's about the same boat i'm in , too . 
it gets kind of boring . 
how big is the family you cook for ? 
uh , five . 
we have four , 
and two of them are teenage boys , 
 oh , well i'll be hitting that fairly soon because all of mine are boys , too . 
are they ? .
and they get pretty particular sometimes in 
we have that problem too . 
but also , now it's just the amount that they eat . 
it's just absolutely incredible .
oh yeah , 
well see , my oldest is nine 
and he already 
does he ? .
and i told him 
that's true . 
uh , do you have any favorite things that you serve when you are doing a special meal ?
my husband and i , our favorite meal is , uh , 
and we do it 
like for special stuff 
and he does the steak 
and then uh , 
out on the grill ? 
and he marinates it in his special stuff 
and it's real good . 
and , uh , 
ooh , yeah . 
and asparagus . 
and that's our favorite ,
ooh , that's sound good . 
i love that . 
my husband really likes seafood . 
so do we .
um , and ,   i think that no matter what i do , i don't serve enough of it , really , uh , to suit him . 
i didn't grow up eating that much seafood 
and , uh , so i don't know , 
it's just kind of not natural to me 
but i like it . 
and , uh , i don't know , 
one of his favorite things is , uh , 
well it's called seafood stew 
and that you serve over rice . 
and , uh , it has oysters and shrimp and crab in it . 
that's kind of louisiana i think 
i don't know what that , 
i don't see how you eat that , 
i don't either .
but , uh , 
it is really good 
a large amount . 
and so usually we eat one 
and i freeze two containers of it . 
then that's just real quick to get it out and serve it over rice . 
but neither of my kids will eat it .
so then 
 so it , 
it defeats the purpose . 
it really does . 
one thing i've run across , recently though , 
a friend gave me a recipe that i really like for chicken enchiladas . 
oh yeah . 
have you made them ? 
does he , ooh . 
i don't eat enchiladas . 
i don't like the tex , 
i don't know , 
i guess it's the texture , or something . 
i don't like the taste of enchiladas . 
but everyone else in my family does . 
well , these are done with a flour tortilla . 
is that what he uses ? 
i don't know , 
it's , i don't know what , 
i don't know what it is about the enchiladas . 
i just , 
 and i'm the only one including my mom and dad and my brother . 
i'm the only one that 
isn't that something ? 
but , my kids love it . 
i was going to say , my kids both eat it . 
i guess that's one thing that i particularly like , um . 
but i think it's good for company , too , 
and i've made it a few times . 
um , and you can make a lot at one time 
i've got a chicken casserole that's like that , that i've , 
it's nice when it makes ,
and then , 
because it makes a real big casserole and then another one that i freeze . 
or i give it to my mom and dad if i know we're not 
it's jus , 
you can use chicken or turkey , 
and it's rice and ,    , 
when i do recipes i just throw stuff in . 
i'm not real good about measuring 
 because i just , 
i do it to taste . 
sometimes those are the best ones , 
 well yeah , 
but like , it's just chicken , 
it's , as much as you want , you know torn up 
and that's it , and some hardboiled eggs . 
 ooh , that sounds good . 
you just mix it all together and pop it in the oven just to , you know , heat it through . 
and you sprinkle , uh , those , uh , toasted onion rings .
oh , yeah . 
those are good aren't they ? .
and it goes 
that sounds good . 
 and it's filling because of the rice . 
you cook the rice before you put it in ? 
i bet the mayonnaise in there kind of gives it a 
it gives it an extra 
i guess i would now use the new mayonnaise free . 
that cholesterol fat free ? 
that's really wonderful that they're coming out with so many 
low calorie , you know , good thing except then you put your mayonnaise in there and spoil the whole thing . 
i know . 
you know and now it's okay 
and you can even , 
i used to just put a tiny bit in . 
well now , i'm just putting more and more in .
i don't like tuna salad unless it's got lots of mayonnaise in it . 
and hundred calories per tablespoon 
and now it's like twelve . 
i just think that's the best thing to have happened , 
i'm just so excited about that . 
we did the lowcal stuff . 
well with my kids i don't , 
they get enough sugar and 
mine are bouncing off the walls normally anyway . 
and they don't need any added help . 
so , when we're here at home , you know , with sweets and stuff , we don't really do that much . 
i do a lot of fruits 
and drink wise they have koolaid , milk or water .
now when they go to their grandmother's house ,
that's when they , 
 that's good . 
that's exactly what it is . 
oh , one of my boys has high cholesterol . 
oh really ? 
have you ever found out 
not yet . 
um , and my other one does not . 
 so , oh , year or so ago he found out 
and he went on a fairly strict diet to try to get it down . and did! 
he was able to get it down . 
i think it's mostly hereditary because we really have never eaten high 
he's never eaten any eggs . 
he's never had anything but skim milk 
and you know , i've never bought butter 
but , um , oh , he just left for the doctor again 
and it's kind of back up . 
um , so he needs to be careful again . 
 so we've really been talking about the foods , you know , for him to be sure to eat 
the lower cholesterol foods and stuff .
 and , uh , so he's eating an apple a day for the last two days .
and all that kind of stuff does really help . 
well i guess i enjoy eating out , um , uh , here and there , 
or a good change from cooking and eating at home 
and i guess i like a variety of restaurants . 
uh , sometimes it's fun to go out and just have a hamburger and french fries and sort of a hamburger and french fry meal , 
and sometimes i enjoy going out having a formal meal . 
and , uh , sometimes it's nice to go out and have a salad . 
something , you know , 
well , a variety . 
i like to go sometimes without them 
so  , 
sometimes i think we pay the babysitter as much as paying for their dinner 
so , uh , you know , it just varies , 
we do a mix . 
sometimes it's really nice to be able to go out and eat with just my husband 
and it wouldn't even really matter which restaurant it was , just to , you know , have a moment of peace and quiet without 
this is our night out . 
but , uh , anyway , where do you like to eat ? 
uh , well , uh , we don't have any children 
so , uh , we tend to ,
and , uh , we're very attracted to exotic food . 
and , uh , we like indian food , and thai cuisine and , uh , sort of gourmet mexican and , uh , things like that , as well as texmex and italian and , uh , chinese and things , and things of that sort . 
of course , we like to occasionally go out and get down and dirty with barbecue or hamburgers 
and , uh , we probably go out one to two times a week . 
and , uh , uh , we're pretty much regulars at an local italian restaurant . 
oh , which one do you like ? 
oh , okay . 
well , it's been a long time since we've been in there 
uh , but it's good . 
there's an italian restaurant over by , uh , plano parkway there , 
 oh , is it campari's or something ? 
i've heard about it , 
i haven't been in there . 
well , it's good . 
my husband had been in there several times 
and actually we went in there for lunch one day . 
and , uh , their pastas were great . 
that's one of the things , a good pasta means a lot to me . 
i like different kinds of food . 
so , when we go out , i'm always looking for something other than the standard menu , even if ,
and once in a while things backfire . 
i mean , we've gone for romanian food and lebanese food , and things like that 
 oh , god . 
 and i'm not fond of some of those things 
but we'll try anything . 
we've had ethiopian . and , uh , not in plano of course .
i don't think so .
but , we really do enjoy going out 
uh , and , um , i'm pretty adventurous in cooking , too , which also occasionally backfires . 
even though traditional it can backfire . 
how do you usually find a new restaurant ? 
uh , well my husband's he's the ethnic fan . 
so he's , 
i don't know . 
you know what , we read the , uh , d magazine 
so do we . 
 we check that and , uh , the friday section in the newspaper 
they often do ratings of restaurants , 
 uh , we often save those and ventured out on , from there , uh , just for something that had a high rating . 
we have found , uh , a number of restaurants either through d the ,
when a new restaurant opens up , they usually send out coupons . 
so we'll go in . 
and very often we'll ,
and we'll stick with it 
once uh , we'll stay there . 
oh good . 
 but we've found probably half of our sort of regular restaurants through coupons ,
oh . oh , yeah . 
we use the coupons , too . 
that's true . 
i mean it's wonderful , particularly if you have more than two people and you've got say four or something like that . 
it's very expensive to go out to eat . 
oh right . 
so , yeah 
that is really one of our , 
it's almost a hobby with us . 
well i think that's ex , 
so , uh , just a change of pace 
 so , uh 
oh , absolutely . 
and do the dishes .
and do the dishes . 
and , uh , actually it's kind of nice to , you know , 
i always , 
uh , a waitress or waiter that waits the table , it's nice that they're attentive 
but it's not nice when they're too attentive . 
oh , yes . 
so , uh , we've had experience with that , too . 
my sister , who also lives here in dallas , uh , tends to , uh , chat with waiters and waitresses and become their best friends during the course of dinner , which drives me absolutely batty . 
oh , yeah . 
  but   , 
it may help their tip , may not , huh . 
what's your favorite restaurant ? 
 gosh , i guess just in plano i like to go to souper salads . 
uh , chili's is always fine . 
i guess if we go is it routh street cafe . 
you know , we've never been there . 
 and that's supposed to be wonderful . 
you'd like it especially it you're adventuresome . 
we've taken people there several times 
and , uh , they have a good choice of things that are very different sounding . 
i guess , it's , whether you call it southwestern 
but , uh , oh we had venison 
and then i guess it must be seasonal 
and we've been back , 
oh , i guess it's in the winter season 
well they've never had it 
but , uh , well you ought to try that . 
it's very good . 
i would probably like that . 
one or two times in my life i've ever had venison , i've loved it . 
but , you know , it's just not , 
i don't know people who hunt 
so  , 
that's supposed to be a wonderful place . 
fairly often . 
and , uh , sometimes we'll go , you know , 
we also go to chili's and , uh , colter's bar b q , 
there is a little thai place that's over on park that , we go to . 
my husband particularly likes that . 
we go into dallas ,
and , uh , we'll go down to , uh , blue mesa grill , mexican food , 
oh , that's good . 
i've been there . 
so you probably have a job you need to get to pretty soon . 
i'm already on my job 
oh , you are , 
oh , wonderful , 
well how do you dress for work ? 
my dress for work , uh , most of the time is , uh , rather comfortable and casual 
the , um , thing that distinguishes me a lot of the time when i have to dress real professionally for a meeting or something is i wear a clerical collar 
but when i don't need to dress up for a meeting or a 
so you're in a church there ? 
well , i'm working , this is my first morning to work down at our little church preschool , 
and they've told me to wear just something terribly comfortable because these are two year olds , 
and uh , they have bible lessons 
and they have all the things during the morning , 
but they still have snack time and play time , 
so , i'm going to be dressing just in casual slacks and tshirts , probably not blue jeans , but little bit short of that , just tennis shoes and play clothes . 
well , around there you can probably wear , uh , tshirts and other things , 
but around here , at this time of the year 
i'm envious .
well , it's a beautiful day here , 
and it's in the sixties , 
but we still have a lot of hot afternoons , 
it's supposed to be eightyfive today , 
so you'll still see people , 
i mean , they're in their summer clothes during the afternoons , because you just can't stand the sweaters , 
but in the mornings people are dressing for work in their sweaters because they just want it to be fall so badly .
we wear coats 
did you ? 
but i don't think there's an escape from light jackets . 
i understand . 
the wind will take away a lot of body heat . 
well , so are the people around you , um , dressing similar to you ? 
so you don't have to buy the lot of the wardrobe that some of the people in banking and that kind of thing do . 
i'm not stuck with that 
well , that's good . 
as i say , unless it happens to be , 
now yesterday i had to dress up , and 
but then i can go home later in the day and be a little more casual 
well that's wonderful .
 and then if i have a meeting of people that i know , i can be very casual in the evening . 
well , my husband has to take the bus into dallas , and doesn't return all day , 
so he has to dress , 
and he just really hates it , 
they have the long sleeve shirts and the whole tie and the whole suit , 
and even when his job is not going to be with people all day long , he said it's just part of the uniform and the expected image that they have to dress . 
around here in a lot of places that's the way it is 
 i mean , expected , uh , dress codes 
and the people need to follow that . 
i think , uh , years ago , i used to be far more , uh , committed to the idea of a dress code 
 but i've relaxed a lot more as i've gotten older and become more comfortable with myself . 
well , i think that's great . 
i think that's good . 
it's taken a long time to break away ,
i understand . 
 but now that i've broken away from it , i'm glad i have . 
well , another interesting thing on even in my forties , how much younger i dress than my mother would have in her forties , 
and i will run around to the store in things , in slacks and tennis shoes , 
and she , 
you mean you don't need to wear little old house dresses any more ? 
and pearls , 
 and she would not have even probably owned a pair of tennis shoes after she got out of high school , 
so , uh , she tells me i dress young , 
but that's okay   .
that's a good idea , 
there , you know , 
what kind of shoes do they wear down there ? 
well , we wear , 
of course , like i said , if my husband's going downtown , he's got the whole , uh , you know , men's dress shoes 
 but for as out here , just anything that the moms , 
we all kind of have our own little dress code of just either tennis shoes or little loafers and , uh , tights , and things that feel comfortable to us around our kids . 
we can wear pretty much that , although , um , tennis shoes are kind of out 
i'm sure they are there . 
 that's right , 
i'm sure that true . 
it's a lot different than working in a kids preschool . 
a lot different . 
that's right . 
well , you all have a nice day there . 
you too , 
and thank you for calling . 
thank you very much . 
do you have any ? 
i have a springer spaniel , 
and her name is thumper . 
she's about seven or eight years old . 
i got her for christmas from my family , uh , back when we lived in nebraska . 
i like to hunt , 
and , uh , so , i thought that if i had a good hunting dog like thumper that , boy , i could just go out and get all kinds of game .
did it work ? .
for many years i had a dog that was part springer spaniel . 
i just love them . 
her name was molly , 
but she isn't alive any more .
we had her for , um , fifteen years , i think , my family did , and just loved her . 
she was the greatest , um , went through two generations of children in my family and was always very gentle . 
do you have a pet now ? 
he just turned seven , also , 
and i , um , got him in arizona 
and he is huge . 
he is eighteen pounds . 
what kind of cat is it ? 
um , i got him , 
in a shed 
so he , 
and cross part with some kind of desert animal , because he's very long and lanky , 
but he's a very tame spoiled house cat , you know , now that i've had him for seven years . 
being born outside , you didn't have any problems house training him ? 
that's good . 
he's great , 
and uh , uh , he's really spoiled , though .
but he's really big , 
so , lots of times he seems to get in fights , 
and when he was younger i think he started them , 
and now , i think he barely makes it . 
i think he gets beat up even though he's big , because he's 
and older .
well , we went to a cat show at the plano center here in town , 
but we thought , well , if we ever get another cat , you know , we'd want something kind of unique , 
so , we kind of looked around , 
and they had everything from hairless cats to siamese cats and persian cats 
and we sort of fell in love with the , uh , maine coon cats . 
oh , i've seen them . 
they're huge . 
they were 
actually , i can't remember , 
they for mousers 
so they're very nautical , too .
i'll be darned . 
i didn't know that . 
i just , 
uh , in the area of folklore , 
but i'm not sure . 
well that's interesting . 
we kind of like , 
well , my family didn't necessarily like them as much as i did , 
but the manx , is that the one that doesn't have a tail 
it sort of has a bob tail . 
i kind of like that , too , 
i'd love to go to a cat show . 
i'm a real cat lover . 
i'd have a lot more cats if my boyfriend would let me .
he doesn't really like mine , let alone another one . 
i work for a university , 
and i went to , uh , omaha , nebraska to recruit students , 
and i had some time off in the afternoon , 
so i went to a pet shop , 
and i saw these little springer spaniels 
 and so i decided , well , you know , this would really be a nice dog to have , 
so , when i got back home to carney , nebraska , i told my wife about it , 
i can just hear the dog crying for me now .
i know what you mean . 
and christmas is coming up , hint , hint , 
and so , i had to go back the next week , as well as a bunch of other people from the university , 
and one of the people , uh , that we went with , uh , they were friends of ours , 
and so , we got to omaha , 
and i decided i'd take my friend over and show him the dog , 
and so i got over there , 
and i didn't realize it , 
but this guy had somehow worked it out so that he got there a little bit earlier , bought the dog , 
and she was in the back room , 
and so that night we had a reception for some of the , uh , potential high school students or college students , 
 and , uh , he had the dog the whole time in his room , 
and i had no idea . 
and so we headed back to carney that night , 
and the dog rode in the car 
and we stopped along the way and had a bite to eat 
and they left the dog in the car , 
and i guess while we were inside eating , thumper just tore the heck out of the inside of the car , 
and , uh , finally we made it back to , uh , to carney 
do you have any hobbies that you like to do ? 
oh , yes . 
 oh , i generically have , you know , millions of hobbies . 
all right , 
that's an interesting assortment . 
my husband is into cycling . 
in fact , he's out there right now 
i'm not quite that bad . 
i'm just a weekend cyclist . 
handicraft type things . 
whittling or  , 
just whittle away my life . 
uh , no , 
i c , 
nothing like that . 
uh , uh , 
i do some things . 
i've gotten into , 
uh , oh , i like to decorate things 
and i do sweatshirts and tshirts 
and i've gotten to where i have started selling them at craft shows and things . 
oh , that's pretty good . 
uh , and i have done fairly well at them . 
i've had 
a few of my little hobby projects have totally bombed , 
but most  ,
my only craft work is kind of like computers and , you know , go off to the little computer club meetings , 
and , it's kind of nice because i've made money at it , too . 
considering i work for it a living , 
but i've got a couple of articles published . 
it's kind of neat . 
what does a computer club do . 
i didn't know there were such things . 
oh , yeah , 
just all over the place . 
they just get around or else , uh , uh , you know , 
like half the members are really expert 
and the other half are like really not . 
and , uh , we kind of help out the people who are really not .
uh , you're not in , 
but i'm uh , the , you know , dial around randomly trying to break into computers type 
 well , that's kind of interesting hobby . 
what else , did you , 
you said you did cycling ? 
what was the other thing ? 
backpacking . 
i belong to a boy scout troop . 
it beats paying united way . 
i just , you know 
well , we have done that . 
uh , our two older boys were in boy scouts 
and my daughter was in girl scouts until just about a year ago 
 so we've .
but , it , 
that's a great thing to do , you know , really . 
have you been backpacking anyplace exciting ? 
uh , well , just last weekend went to davy crockett forest 
and we go to , uh , places out in , 
uh , uh , let's see 
what's that state north of us , 
that state 
oh , that one . 
that one . 
to the , 
uh , oh , by fort sill there ? 
uh , no , 
trying to think of the name of it . 
well , yeah , 
no memory . 
have you gone , like to fillmont with the boy scouts ? 
i wasn't able to get the time off , but maybe next year . 
it's a good possibility . 
i've always thought that would be a real fun thing to do . 
oh , yeah , 
when i was a kid , uh , we'd do the equivalent thing in the high sierras . 
that was loads of fun . 
does your whole family like to do it , 
like know , for a vacation you'd go backpacking ? 
uh , no , 
i'm just me .
oh , okay . 
you just , oh , 
oh , yeah , 
well , sometimes , uh , 
it's better than , you know , owning on them and making payments on them ,
sometimes i think that might not be a bad idea .
uh , you said you did it in the high sierras . 
uh , do you ever , you know , just vacation someplace where you strictly backpack ? 
oh , yeah , 
but , uh , there's , uh , some stuff that i want to do with like sierra club and go down to grand canyon or something like that . 
so , you know , they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and 
which seems kind of reasonable because that means you don't have to take twenty thirteen year olds with you , which seems just a tad more relaxing .
well , i , 
uh , well , i like swimming . 
which is in now . 
i've done that 
and i also , 
when i like something , i usually try to figure out how to make money off of it . 
is it mike ? 
do you repair your own car ? 
i've always been  , i guess a product of a handyman father . 
well , i tell you what , count your blessings because 
although i'll tell you , you know , over the years the cars get more complicated . 
well , that's why i don't do as much as i'd like . 
is that right ? 
and , now since then , you know , the closer a car is to a fiftysix buick , the more i know about it . 
and then start getting into these nissans and the like 
and i just can't keep up . 
i agree . 
about all i ever , 
i never was too mechanically inclined , 
but i used to always change my own oil and do the points and plugs and , 
course , they don't use , uh , points anymore . 
that's right .
and , uh , now brakes , i've always done a lot of , you know , changing brakes . 
 and i could always do the alternator , you know , and starter . 
i don't anymore , 
but i have a lot of times . 
i understand . 
my last car repair actually had to do with brakes 
and it's one i did not do myself . 
i took the car , my , 
i have a seventynine el dorado , took it to be inspected 
 and the parking brake failed . 
so i got under there and messed with uh , that adjustment 
and then i got there and tried to , 
i did everything that i could think to do . 
and , eventually i brought it up to a place called just brakes 
 and it turns out that there's a , 
the parking brake in the rear , 
there's disc brakes 
and the parking brake is a piston deal . 
and because the parking brake hadn't been used in so many years , the piston froze up . 
so they ended up having to pound it out . 
and one of them , they ,
and the other one it was just frozen solid , 
so i ended up having to buy one 
and all total , it was just under two hundred dollars , believe it or not , to get all that done .
but i don't , like i s , 
well , it was a lot of money , 
but , i , 
it got to the point where i didn't know what was going on 
well , do you still do much work on them , then ? 
at the beginning of september 
and , whenever i can , i do try . 
 actually , i'd say this . 
i've gotten to the point where i don't change the oil anymore . only because , 
disposal is a problem . 
but also uh , these fast oil change places , you just can't beat them . 
that's true . 
for sixteen bucks they'll 
that's true . 
i've quit doing that myself . 
but one of the main reasons was the disposal of the oil , you know . 
that's right . 
 uh , but , it , 
but , no , 
i guess , i , 
and the main reason that it's quick . 
well , have you seen a new movie lately ? 
well , uh , i am a student 
and i have , uh , been actually watching more movies on video ,
uh , and , uh , catch robin hood . 
uh , i haven't seen either one of those . 
uh , what are some of the shows that you have been able to rent though ? 
uh , let's see . 
uh , i'm trying to just think of the ones that have come on . 
uh , white palace which i thought was over hyped , um , recently . 
well , you're catching me uh , uh , at mind's end here . 
what have you .
well , maybe uh , you have seen dances with wolves . 
what did you think of that one ? 
enjoyed that quite a bit . 
um , i thought the cinematography was excellent . 
uh , the story was , 
uh , though it tended to be a little one sided 
uh , it was believable . 
in june , 
and that's when the movie was filmed , 
and , uh , when the movie came out , we went , 
uh , my dad lives in the state capital , which is pierre 
 and it was filmed right outside of pierre . 
in fact , that was a live scene . 
uh , there's a guy that has got a buffalo farm , 
and he has got over ten thousand head of buffalo my dad has got a little plane , we flew over it all a , looked at the buffalo , 
it was really neat . 
the movie in the movie theater in pierre 
they knew the extras or the , 
so , when i watched it on video cassette than i did , uh , in the movie theater because my attention would get diverted every time they'd say that . 
and of picking up the overall , 
i thought it was a good film . 
but you are right , 
i think it was very one sided . 
it was , 
but it's a side that hasn't been told . uh , as far as , you know , telling it from , you know , the indians as the good guys and the , the white men as the bad guys . 
the westerns that we have seen for years and years , 
and it's just , shoot the indians , 
and they are always the savages . 
 in fact , i was watching wild wild west last night 
um , but it was an interesting movie . 
uh , have you seen pretty woman ? 
now i thought that was a good show . 
that was a good movie . 
um , it was just kind of a get away movie . 
kind of , 
uh , it didn't have any real social bearing 
but it was an enjoyable movie . 
it was kind of like the star wars 
you're bringing it , 
i don't know , 
i sure did have a mind lock about the movies i've seen . 
 but , yeah , 
i've seen pretty woman and dances with wolves , 
and , uh , 
uh , now are you much of a star trek fan , 
are you going to see this next one that's coming out ? 
have you seen the rest ? 
i think i've missed one . 
i'm not sure , 
i actually went to the star trek twenty fifth anniversary marathon that happened about a month ago , 
and they showed all five in a row . 
was that here in dallas ? 
oh , they had it everywhere , 
uh , every major city had one theater that did it 
because we had one here in dallas . 
and they did it in houston , 
well , they did it everywhere . 
and it was really good to see all the movies and how the story developed , 
and the thing that i didn't realize is that if you watch the movies in a row , uh , time wise they happen one after another 
but you can watch the characters develop , 
and he was in arlington , virginia .
oh , no . 
oh , gosh , oh , gosh . 
we do . 
you go ahead first , if you'd like . 
let me think here . 
i haven't been watching much t v lately .
you know 
i used to . 
uh , i have one favorite soap opera . 
i still watch 
and i tape because i'm not home .
and , uh , let's see , 
that's general hospital , 
and then , uh , at night , uh , i don't usually sit down till almost nine o'clock 
i know . 
and , uh , then i watch , 
uh , what do i watch at nine o'clock . 
let's see , 
oh , well , tuesday nights i guess , we try to catch a couple of the shows that the kids like . 
and , uh , 
are they little ? 
i have a seven year old and a ten year old . 
they're pretty young . 
uh , so we usually catch , uh , full house , 
and , uh , what's the one comes on after that . 
it's a new one , uh ,  , 
i don't know , 
my kids are older 
 so i don't know some of those shows now , like i used to .
uh , other than that , uh , oh , gosh . i watch knots landing on thursday nights ,
well i like the comedies . 
they're just light , too . 
i have to watch murphy brown 
i really like , 
oh , now that is a good one . 
i make a point of 
that is . 
if i'm home on mondays , then i definitely watch her . 
i love that 
and i really like coach . 
i think when it's good , it's just a scream . 
well , he's a good actor . 
he really is good . 
well , he's probably playing himself . 
half the time you see these people on an interview show , they act just like they do in their parts .
i saw him on johnny carson once 
and he acted about the same .
oh , god . 
well , he could very well be .
and , uh , 
so , do you watch much t v , 
well , i watch more now because , well i had been going to school for years and have really been too busy 
 but this semester i'm only taking one course 
and so i see murphy brown and coach and the wonder years . 
i just make a point of seeing those . 
now , i never see that . 
well , i've got a friend that says that is just wonderful show . 
oh , it's fabulous . 
really , you should never miss that . 
they are just gems of shows .
oh , nice . 
now what night is that on now ? 
oh , that's wednesday at , uh , seven thirty . 
wednesday at seven thirty , 
oh , okay . 
wednesdays i go to church choir , 
oh , yeah . 
well , maybe your husband could tape it for you sometime . 
i should get him to do that .
just so you get the idea . 
it wouldn't take , 
so , i watch those . 
are there any new ones this year that came out that you like 
well , you know , i haven't , oh , 
we started watching northern exposure . 
well , it's not really new , 
but it's still kind of new . 
how's that ? 
i haven't seen that . 
i like it a lot . 
it's real different . 
in fact , they never thought it would be a hit . 
i mean , they'll have some things in there almost , you know , like supernatural , or something , 
you know , i mean , somebody will see a figure from the past that nobody else does 
or , i mean , it sounds weird , 
but , it's very , uh , unique show and very well done . 
excellent actors . 
i'll have to watch for that . 
i guess we just , 
it came on after something we used to watch 
 and i guess we just kept sitting there 
and now we make a point of watching .
i can't take all these shows on because next semester i'm not going to be able to watch hardly any television . 
well then , it will be mostly reruns , i guess .
and by the end of february , the way they do it nowadays . 
but , uh , 
but , uh 
i've seen that . 
was she the best one ? 
oh , she was just funny . 
she was really funny . 
and her character was good . 
i don't know that it was her in particular 
so , uh , 
they were all accusing each other of everything in the world .
oh , that was awful 
and who knows still , what really happened , you know . 
well , i know , 
gosh , you never will , probably . 
well , i think the latest soap opera for people is the kennedy trial for those who have cable . 
oh , i know . 
i don't have cable . 
now i told    , 
we don't have that station either , 
so , uh , i haven't been able to catch any of that , 
but just what little we caught on the news . 
it's just as wild as any soap opera , from what i hear on the news . 
oh , i know it . 
and i think he's guilty as the devil . 
well , i don't see how he couldn't be , you know . 
i know , 
what's in it for her . 
there's never anything for you to go to trial as a witness in a case like that .
that's right . 
but , they said she held up so well yesterday . 
i know , 
everybody was saying that 
and then , in the paper said it 
oh , god . 
well , the national enquirer says .
i was reading that in the supermarket line . 
i never have the nerve to buy the thing . 
well , do you watch uh 
says he , 
because i don't either . 
i can't watch it on t v , 
i like the ice skating , 
you know , occasionally , some ice skating will come on , on a sunday or during the olympics 
i always watch that . 
i think it's so beautiful . 
i like to catch the gymnastics sometimes , too . 
oh , yeah , 
that's good . 
well , i suppose we both have credit cards . 
they seem to be a part of life .
how do you use them ? 
well , i do use them . 
uh , i have a few favorites that i use more than others 
and , uh , i try to keep my balances fairly reasonable . 
i could probably pay them off any month if i wanted to . 
uh , but occasionally they can get out of hand and get higher when you start using more than a few 
 and , uh , they all can build up . 
uh , i think they're handy . 
i just get , uh , 
i don't carry a lot of cash with me 
 and , uh , i hate writing checks 
well , do you use credit cards ? 
uh , i watched my grandmother go into debt 
and so i've , 
and then i guess my 
grandmother 
so my mother learned from that 
and i guess she taught me to be very , very careful with them . 
so basically , uh , i just keep them , 
i use them so that i build up a credit rating , you know . 
but , otherwise , uh , i generally , 
and my husband , it turns out , 
i've just been married seven months , 
but he has the same habit 
and we just keep a few 
that's good . 
but we always pay it off right that month 
oh that's , 
so that way we keep out of debt 
and we keep on top of what we're spending . 
well , the interest rates in credit cards is so high now 
it's really , i guess ridiculous to let them keep building . 
that's what i feel . 
but i know some people can get , you know , carried away with them and let them get 
it's really easy , just to forget , you know , that you charged that or charged that . 
i try to keep all my receipts and keep them in someplace where i know that the bill's going to come , 
but sometimes i forget 
and so , you know , a bill will come in 
uh , yeah . 
but so far , we've been able to pay it off every time 
well , that's good . 
kind of looking for a visa that has a lower interest rate . 
it seems that some of them have gotten higher 
 and , uh , i saw on t v , they had a program on , uh , credit cards 
and they're supposed to , 
i don't know if it was tennessee or arkansas or some other state had a visa card that was the lowest one in the country . 
and i 
and then i went and looked to see what my visa was 
and i think it's eighteen percent or something 
 so , think i want to find something that has a lower 
have you ever used discover card ? 
i'm not even sure what their interest rate is since i pay it off 
but you know , 
is that the one from sears ? 
but uh , it's pretty well taken all over the u s now . 
i mean , uh , i've haven't found many places that don't take discover . 
and there's no annual service fee , which is good . 
 you know , and then , uh , they also give you , they say cash back , uh , like at the end of the year . 
for the amount that i charge , i get two dollars back or something 
 but if you use credit cards a lot you probably get more back . 
oh , they give you money back for using your credit card . 
that's it . 
i didn't know that . 
and i think the service charge is pretty low , too , 
but , i'm not sure . 
um . well , you know , sears was one of the few department stores that never would take any other credit cards . 
i worked at sears for over ten years 
and , uh , it was only a sears card that they would take 
so , you know , now they'll take the discover , 
but i still don't know if sears will take visa or mastercard . 
but , uh 
i just figure with the visa and 
i can do enough damage with those two . 
i think it's best to keep the number down 
i've got some that you know , i haven't even used at all , uh , past few years 
i probably wouldn't be able to use them . 
but , uh , i do like my dillard's , 
i have to admit that's one of my favorite places to shop . 
and i do use dillard's probably more than any of the other department stores . 
well , it was good talking to you . 
good talking to you beth . 
good luck . 
have a good evening . 
you , too . 
well , got any problems on mockingbird with crime 
or is that a crime free zone there ? 
i'm afraid you're right . 
and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house . 
oh , my . 
and they had stopped a stolen car 
oh , boy . 
and then the other one was on the roof in the back . 
by your house ? 
oh , my goodness . 
aye , aye , aye .
so i'm very much aware of , uh , crime in the cities and the concern about it . 
that's got to be a frightening way to 
it was . 
uh , i kept hearing noises 
and so i knew that i was not going to sleep until i got up and went out and checked the garage , 
so i got you know , through the house into the garage . 
there was no one there , 
but i wanted to be sure . 
oh , boy . 
is plano beginning to experience you know , in the 
i think , uh , you know , as any city grows up , uh , you get the hoods and the riffraff and 
and i think , 
uh , you know , fortunately the sirens and everything we hear are over on spring creek , 
but , uh , we've lived here sixteen years 
well , i was thinking , if you've been there that long , you've seen plano grow 
well , uh , central expressway , uh , 
you know and , 
well , i was appalled to read the other day about the , uh , uh , shooting on the tollway . 
that couldn't be too far from you , neither . 
uh , well , it's farther west of me . 
i live over near white rock lake . 
oh , yes , 
but , uh , 
uh , it was really frightening to ,
uh , i never thought about someone robbing those , 
but , apparently , they do . 
i don't know , uh , how a few bucks can be worth shooting somebody 
but i guess when people do those things , they don't really give a thought of the consequences at the time . 
it's , looks like 
i think you're right , uh , although i think that may be an excuse for people , too . 
i didn't know what i was doing . 
that kind . 
just like the old alcohol idea 
well , yes , 
and i work in south dallas for the dallas school system . 
 oh , boy . 
 and , uh , uh , 
where do you work ? 
uh , do you know where oakland and hatcher are ? 
uh , yes , 
school there ? 
uh , no 
we're over by fair park . 
oh , my goodness . 
and , uh , you know , you watch the people . 
there are marvelous b m w s and mercedes and cadillacs and everything parked all up and down the street outside these awful taverns . 
and the kids see that 
and , uh , they know that they can earn several hundred dollars in a day uh , you know , running for , uh , drug dealers if , 
definitely that area , that's big time . 
it surely is . 
i don't think i'd go to work without a bulletproof vest on myself   .
 well , i'm careful . 
that's the worst neighborhood in the whole area . 
it's , uh , a little scary sometimes 
and , uh , i manage the , 
i'll tell you what , i can't say a whole lot about credit cards because i , uh , tore mine up . 
is that right ? 
i know some other people that have done that . 
uh , i got in some uh , financial problems because of credit cards 
so i , uh , basically just got rid of all of them . 
a couple . 
i have a , uh , gas card that i use just for gas and 
exactly the same thing . 
uh , you know , they kind of overextended and borrowed and borrowed 
and finally they realized that they were abusing them and weren't going to get out of the hole 
and they just cut them all up except for one they kept for emergencies 
i know it . 
i did just the opposite . 
i sort of followed in my , uh , parents' footsteps . 
i have quite a few of them . 
but uh , i basically never charge anything i don't have the money in the bank to pay for . 
uh , and i always pay them off totally every month . 
 oh , is that right ? 
that's a good policy . 
and they're just a convenience for me . 
i don't have to get cash out of the bank , 
and i don't have to be writing checks 
uh , sometimes i wish i had them , 
but in most cases , i'm glad i don't 
i wish i did , 
uh , and you know , it , 
i just don't want to get into that situation again , 
i mean , it's easy , 
i mean , you don't have anything transferring , just a little signature , 
oh , that's it . 
see , and that's , 
even with my gas card 
and i'll end up buying , you know , candy and drinks and 
and then at the end of the month you know , i get a bill 
well , you know , but the , 
i mean , there are some inherent limits there , 
you're not going to run up a few thousand dollars for that , 
that's true , 
but certainly understand where  , 
now i , 
you know , 
the thing that probably helps me most doing that is really , you know , uh , not so much discipline , 
i mean , well , i mean , you have sort of a discipline in general about finances , 
i mean 
oh , yeah . 
isn't it , 
that's unbelievable . 
let me ask you this . 
how , how old are you ? 
i'm , uh , thirtythree . 
thirtythree ? 
excuse me . 
you'll be thirtythree this year ? 
you want to be thirtytwo as long as you can , huh . 
it's coming . 
uh , it's unbelievable . 
you know , that i refuse to pay them interest 
and my wife recently , uh , decided she had to go to brazil and was going to take off 
and , she's from there and 
but , you know , she could pay it off , 
and so i ,
but she's paying it , 
and , uh , i just won't do it . 
i mean , she's paying , i don't know what per month , you know , forty , fifty dollars per month in interest 
oh , jeez . 
 and i just , 
if i need to borrow that kind of money , i'll go to the bank 
and , uh , 
and then , you bet . 
you know . 
uh , yeah , 
i've even , uh , heard some people that have applied for credit cards with much less , uh 
oh , yeah . 
and there's , uh , uh , some negotiating there , too , 
because i heard , uh , 
on one of the local talk shows here , they had somebody on and said , what you can do is , uh , call , you know , 
i might , 
 you know , and if you've got a pretty good 
um , i might try that because i have one card that i've had for about , uh , i don't know , nine or ten years . 
in fact , that's what this guy , 
you know , he wrote a book on it 
and he says with several of his cards 
and yours is at , you know , eighteen or nineteen percent . 
it does not make sense for me to do that 
and if you won't drop my rates , i'll just go ahead and send you back your card 
and i'll go somewhere else and get it . 
for me the big thing , you know , uh , uh , is the annual fee 
and i just refuse , 
i won't get any card now , 
i've got a good rating 
and i've got , you know , 
and i'm not going to pay an annual fee . 
the only one i actually pay on is this one that , the very first , 
my name is dolphene . 
i live in texas . 
my name is pat johnson 
and i live in texas too . 
i work for t i , 
do you also ? 
i work for the dallas school system . 
oh , okay . 
oh , okay . 
and how do you feel about putting someone in the nursing home ? 
well , i don't think that uh , any of my relatives would really like to go there . 
i believe , if i , am in a position , uh , like when my mother gets to a point where she needs special care that i will be able to just bring her into my home 
that way . 
i would find it very difficult , uh , to , uh , place my father or my stepmother 
it's more how they feel about it . 
and it is like they feel , uh , the way my mother would put it like somebody had thrown them away .
i do think that there are some significant kinds of things to to look for , you know , if you are faced with placing someone .
but attitude of staff makes such a tremendous difference . 
and i have a a friend who is partly paralyzed and is in a nursing home 
and , uh , i know that the cheerful pleasant people who treat her kindly make all the difference in the world in how she feels about , uh , her situation . 
and another thing to think about , uh , on the positive side of the nursing homes here , 
i use to work in one of the offices in a nursing home 
 and i got to see a lot of the things that they did 
 uh , they had a lot of crafts 
and they had a lot of games 
and , uh , they , get together and they do all sorts of things 
and then there 
you know , very nice and friendly to everybody 
 and , uh , then there are others that are , 
uh , it is just a job 
and they just you know 
uh , the attitude of the staff as you said is really 
i think it would matter too , uh , kinds of , uh , disabilities that the nursing home accepts .
and they may be ambulatory , 
but they tend to behave like small children 
 and that would be very difficult i think for an adult who wasn't in that situation to to have to deal with on a daily basis . 
well , it is like , the one that i worked in , uh , you would see some of them just like in wheelchairs all day , 
they would just roll themselves around all over the place 
and then you would were like distant from the other group 
and they they just didn't like participate together with the others 
disease and stuff like that 
alzheimer , 
 and uh , they weren't really together with the rest of them , when they got together for such activities . 
and that can , 
so frank , what , uh , type of , uh , budget do you or your family have ? 
 well , uh i don't know that we really have a budget . 
i have a set amount that i save . 
a way , 
budget our money apparently . 
uh , my wife , uh , uh , gets so much to do shopping with every couple of weeks 
and , uh , we allot each of us so much money per week for our personal stuff , gas , and things like that 
and besides that uh , you know , i have a set amount that i save every month . 
that's , uh , sounds like probably a tighter controlled budget than what i have .
i am single , 
but i basically , 
really don't need to . 
i don't need to . 
i am the only that i have to keep track of 
so it makes it a little bit easier . 
that's right . 
uh , and also you know , i try to save a certain amount each month as well 
 and , uh , i try to have an idea of what my expenses are 
and i am pretty consistent from month to month 
 and , uh , uh , whenever that changes i am pretty well aware of it without actually having to maintain a budget for it . 
well , i found that , uh , you know , things , as i have gotten older , 
i am in my fifties now , 
but before we use to have a very strict budget , 
i had four kids 
and , uh , you know we planned out how much we were going to spend for food and how much for this and for that . 
kind of anticipate how much things were going to be . 
uh , i guess one interesting aspect of the budgeting i do now is that uh , i kind of fence off areas of my check book . 
for instance , there are certain things that i know come up , uh , every so often . 
every six months i have to pay car insurance . 
uh , every six months i have to pay my taxes . 
i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh , uh , saving in 
and i also have got a checking account besides that , 
but , what i do on my money market account , my taxes for instance which amount to an average of two hundred and twenty dollars a month . i will just take two hundred and twenty out 
and i put it in parenthesis . 
i take it out of the right line total 
every month i add two hundred and twenty dollars to it . 
then when the tax bill comes in i've got that much set aside . 
and i guess that's a way of budgeting . 
i guess i kind of do a similar thing . more , uh , medium or longer range . 
i just have a maybe a targeted amount that i will save for . 
like i am , 
probably within a year i would like to buy a new car . 
so , i kind of have an amount in my mind 
and i am making every effort put a little bit away and increase the amount that i need for a down payment or whatever . 
uh , cars are definitely something that you have to figure into your budget . not only for buying them , but for keeping them on the road too . 
uh , you know , we've got two cars . 
my wife has a car 
and i like to drive pick up truck . 
so , we are on a schedule where i try every , uh , three or four years to buy a new one . 
and you know i am constantly making car payments , 
but i figure that's got to be the story of my life anyway , is making car payments . 
so , uh , you know , i get one paid for 
and , uh , actually i am saving up for another one besides 
have you thought about , uh , leasing ? 
but leasing wouldn't , 
you know , i don't use it for my business . 
i see . 
my wife uses hers just for pleasure 
and i use mine just to go back and forth to work 
but if you are rolling it over every three years ,
i guess . 
you know , typically , if you purchase your own car you tend to make , uh , the best returns after you pay it off . 
of course , the longer you keep it beyond that point , the more profitable it is to own it yourself . 
uh , i have , uh , been know to keep trucks or cars for oh , ten or twelve years , 
but i find that after about four years they kind of start going down hill 
and you got to put put stuff in them you know . 
that's right . 
mine's , uh , seven years old 
and i think last year that was a rough year for it . 
i had a number of expenses .
but , uh , i am hoping that most of them were just kind of , 
uh , you know the , 
as you get to a certain number of miles , you have to get everything replaced , brakes , shocks and all that . 
so , i just went through that whole set last year . 
i hope that i only have a slow period before i do that again .
those things can really upset your budget when they come in . 
uh , you know , it's nice to have a little bit set aside for the unexpected shall we say .
what line of work are you in ? 
well , uh , we keep a budget to an extent . 
uh , and sort of forces some , uh , uh , restrictions 
and you need to make sure all your bills are paid . 
uh , about yourself ? 
well , i have to say i really don't have a budget . 
both my wife and i , uh , grew up in , uh , families of rather modest means 
and , uh , our family income , at this point , is comfortable . upper middle class i guess you might say . 
and , uh , we're both so , uh , frugal that , uh , we really don't need a budget , you know . 
we just sort of invest the money and go on vacations and always never seem to have any money problems which i guess is a comfortable thing . 
well i guess that really is sort of , uh , keeping a budget , 
you know . you stay uh 
well we stay within our means 
but we 
it just sort of happens automatically . 
although we just moved to california 
and , uh , the cost of living here in california is , uh , i would say rather pathological .
uh , housing prices are , you know , like from four to ten times more expensive than , uh , uh , they were where i came from in , uh , dallas . 
oh , you moved from dallas to san francisco . 
so , uh 
that is a hugh difference . 
actually our standard of living has gone down somewhat since we've moved to california 
but you have good sour dough 
and it's a beautiful place to live .
it's god's country . 
uh , and one way you know that is that only god can afford it .
uh , so budget is not a problem for us . 
uh , at least it hasn't been . 
it may be at this point . 
when i , uh , was in , uh , undergraduate school a long , long time ago , i , uh , noted that the you know , in my discipline , was like oh , six hundred ten dollars a month or something like that . 
and , uh , i noted at that point that you know , if that's what my salary was that i drew then i would be making almost twice as much as my father made during his best year ever . 
so i stopped worrying about money . 
 and it , 
never have worried about money since then . 
well , that's a system too . 
sometimes , uh , it's a bit of a problem , you know , because i guess i don't really manage my money the way i should . 
but , uh , i suppose i've lost money on not taking good advantage of , uh , investments 
well then again , you know , you said you are able to take trips . 
and you do , obviously , have enough to live on 
so i guess you're indirectly budgeting .
so , i mean that's a form of budgeting i would think .
well , i guess we're both lucky in that regard then . 
how big is your family ? 
uh , well we have one on the way . 
i see . 
uh , my wife , 
and then , uh , in , uh , september . 
 so how , 
once you get ten children though , you may have , 
i think it's just going to be one . 
oh , all right .
how about yourself ? 
i have two kids . 
 uh , one 
and they are beginning to be a budget problem but , uh , have not been really up to this point . 
do they budget at all ? 
i mean do you have them on an allowance ? 
i give them an allowance 
and they , uh , 
i basically give my son ten dollars a week 
and i put half of it in the bank 
and i give him the other half in cold cash . 
and , uh , he has a teller card so he can , uh , do what he wishes with the money that i put in the bank . 
but , at least , it isn't , you know , burning a hole in his pocket . 
if he wants to use it , he has to go get it 
and that usually  , 
  capital punishment , uh , i guess , out in california uh , a lot of , you know , discourse in the paper . 
uh , apparently , you know , they haven't , uh , executed anybody since nineteen sixtyseven , i believe . 
 uh , yeah . 
that's as far back as i can remember .
 well , that's before 
well , we lived in redwood city when we were out there . 
uh , and we found that , uh you know , it was a very liberal kind of community . 
but that the law enforcement community , uh , you know , puts these people behind bars 
and then these lawyer groups get together 
and his , uh , ultimate , uh , demise out for ten or fifteen years . 
uh , and to do that . 
i think capital punishment , uh , uh , was probably stringent enough 
but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way . 
uh , by , uh , uh , capital punishment ? 
well i think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not , 
it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself . 
but you'll stay there for twenty years . 
and nothing is being done about it . 
uh , the laws exist and   are frequently upheld uh , in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find . 
and it's really getting out of hand   in many states . 
well , the term technicality   .
the law enforcement community ,
have been , you know , impuned . 
uh , a noncritical error , though be it not the right way to do it 
the merits of the case in terms of , you know , 
now , at this juncture 
a technicality . 
you know , these hearings are about 
and that's what all these , you know , court cases are about . 
i mean out of the can 
and , uh , you know , he tried to appeal his conviction . uh , 
and , you know , it didn't work . 
but be that as it may , everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry . 
uh , they either , you know , drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody 
and you were his slave . 
and if he didn't like what you did , he killed you . 
and that's pretty effective . 
uh , you know , it's not good for civil rights , i guess , 
but it's pretty effective in that , you know , you've got to get along in the community 
and if you don't you'll perish . either by the hand of your master or by being pushed out in the woods . 
so , in criminal actions , especially , you know , murder cases and that sort of thing . 
well , it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished , 
and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who  actually  didn't the crimes , albeit it seems that we are failing in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off . 
um , for instance , um there's a case a few years back where , uh , the arresting officer , uh , did not read the defendant their rights . 
and where his ,
uh , elementary or intermediate or advanced , uh , drug users . 
and , uh , i know applicants coming into government . 
and i quite frankly , don't see anything wrong with it . 
i guess i'm not a good civil libertarian . 
you're a drug user you have a hidden agenda that's difficult unless you really go into a deep background . 
of course , we're , 
being involved in my organization , uh , we have deep background checks 
and , uh , i have absolutely 
of course , if he's fallen in love with drugs 
and there isn't anything 
but getting stoned or high is the only thing in life that seems to be meaningful , then maybe there is no hope .
what's your , uh , feeling ? 
uh , well toward the other direction . 
uh , well i guess , mainly because , uh , i , well , 
like there's two sides to it i guess . 
uh , one is that , uh , if you're coming to work under the influence of any sort of drug , alcohol , whatever , or , you know , even if it's smoking , inhibits , you know , your ability to function , then that , you know , i don't have any problem at all with testing that individual , you know , on the spot . 
uh , but i guess i feel more like whatever you're doing in your own private life is your own private business . 
uh , and i guess part of the reason there is because of the fact that , uh , things like drug laws seem to come and go . 
you know , we had prohibition for awhile 
and then we didn't have prohibition . 
uh , you know , we've had , i guess , laws against , uh , you know , various other forms of drugs for the last what sixty or seventy years , i guess . 
maybe a little longer . 
well i think , uh , were like ninety , or nineteen ten or nineteen five , something like that . 
so , eighty years or so . 
uh , so i , 
you know , you know , freedom from , uh , search and seizure , you know , uh , on something that may or may not stand as a law , you know , fifty years from now or even twenty or ten , 
who knows . 
well , the thing of it is tha , 
 i mean , prohibition certainly didn't last . 
to support drug habits . 
 well , but you got to look at prohibition though . 
you know , or prostitution or stuff like that , 
 oh , yeah . 
 well it goes back to that , again , 
if you look at prohibition . i mean because it's illegal , it costs more . 
if it was legal , 
i mean , face it you can buy pharmaceutical grade cocaine for what , ten or twenty dollars an ounce . 
i must admit that , 
 and clearly if you're into coke and all you want to do is , you know , snort your brains out all day long , if it was legal , you could do it real cheap 
and , you know , you'd be a menace to nobody but yourself as long as you stayed at home and did it . 
but , yeah , 
get , uh , 
and the costs to society , 
 oh , yeah , 
well that's why there's , you know , people dealing it because there's money in it , you know . 
there's ridiculous amounts of money . 
but i probably have a kind of a draconian , philistine attitude toward it . 
as soon as that's involved in drugs and tha , 
 oh yeah , 
interdiction's hopeless . 
 i mean 
and then another one will jump up . 
 there's no way you're ever going to win that . 
but we see , 
the tighter you squeeze , the more the price goes up , the more incentive there is . 
 i mean that's a losing  fight  .
as soon as we wind up , uh , uh , you know , for , 
well if we can just destroy the market by destroying the demand 
but people 
and i don't see that , 
 well , yeah . 
it goes back to , you know , what can society impose on people . 
i mean , can you force somebody to be a good productive citizen ? 
i don't think you can . 
i mean , you know , you know , was raised with being a very strong bible work ethic 
so , you know , i'm one of these , you know , ten , twelve , fifteen , twenty hour a day type people . 
i can really relate to 
everybody ought to do their own share , 
you know . i don't have any , you know , love lost for people who are on the public dole just because they're too lazy to get a job or that kind of stuff . 
but , you know , 
 see , when you're with a big company or a big organization , a lot of times , uh , you know , the benefits are good 
and , you know , the pay is regular 
but , uh , you know , sometimes you don't get tuned in to what's going on . 
and you get to know what's going on . 
and maybe to do . 
what's your feeling about benefits ? 
what sort of benefits would you like to get from a big company . 
uh , uh , my husband works for mcdonald douglas 
and so his medical benefits are so excellent , you know , 
that's really great . 
you know , i work for , uh , a bank , western financial . 
and , uh , they don't let me know really about anything that's going on . 
even some of the immediate things that i need to know , i don't know it until the next hour 
and all of a sudden we know we've got changes made . 
we're changing departments . 
we're changing policies . 
we're changing doing other kinds of things . which to me is disturbing .
i mean , i feel like if , i don't necessarily need to , uh , be involved since i'm pretty much on a low level , 
you are right there . 
you know , i'm pretty much on a low level as far as , uh , the company is concerned . 
but i do kind of like to know what's going on and what's happening 
and i think i can be a better and more effective employee if i 
 well , th , 
and , uh , actually i work for the f b i . 
oh , my gosh . 
there's lots of things that we don't get told . for good reason . 
that we should know about projects . 
i'm an engineer . you know . 
i'm a cotr . 
and sometim , 
and i worked in the same lab with a guy 
and we didn't really know that much about each other's projects for two years . 
and we should have , 
you know , we're now collaborating . 
  and it   , 
for two years we didn't . kind of stupid . 
on monday . 
uh , we're having little tables put up in front of   lab in the hallways 
and all the other employees are going to come around and see what sort of things we do . which i thought was kind of interesting and , 
that is interesting . 
but , i think you can tolerate a lot of problems if you understand what's going on . 
most of the time management has a hard time distributing or getting the word out to the people who must know . 
and , you know , if you don't really count . if you're not part of the program you might not get told for months . 
or you might , you know , if it doesn't impact you directly . or if your management doesn't think that . 
most big organizations have decent , you know , benefits like retirement and that sort of thing . 
in the private sector i would think that one of the major , uh , situations , especially when you reach , you know , is keeping a job until you retire . 
and engineers to most companies . 
and , uh , it's very much like the military , 
it windows out . 
and i'm getting more responsibility , 
i'm doing this . 
but as you climb up that tree , pretty soon the branches get smaller on the top of the tree 
 and pretty soon somebody falls off . 
i've fallen off twice in the private sector . 
uh , and , you know , i can get up , 
i know . 
kind of scary , you know . because you think of , 
uh , see my son's eighteen right now 
and uh , he wants to go into engineering . 
and the branches of engineering that he wants to go into is now kind of open 
and he's interested in , basically , three different areas . 
but , uh , it's difficult for me to try to give him any kind of advice or to advise him or anything like that . 
he needs to do his own course of investigation and see what he can do because who knows what's going to happen in another thirty years . 
 and in thirty years it becomes pretty critical . 
i mean , my , uh , brotherinlaw uh , i mean he's sixty . 
he's not ready to retire 
but his company uh , is , uh , closing up . 
and because of the defense cutbacks and all that kind of stuff . and all the nuclear and stuff which is what he was working on . he's getting cut back 
he may be retired . 
budgeting activity in our household  is , uh , uh , kind of an informal kind of situation . 
we , you know , put , 
actually what happens uh , is , my check gets automatically deposited . 
i don't even have the glories of bringing home my check anymore . 
you know , and all those people are counting on me to have my wife pay them . you see , 
and so our budgeting , 
we really don't have a formal budgeting situation . 
every time i've ever tried one , uh , i've just got wrapped in my inertia . 
and , uh , i've just decided not to pursue it . 
uh , what's your budget situation ? 
well , actually , uh , i've had a couple of different situations . 
my current one has been the most successful . 
uh , at a certain point in life 
an , my exhusband was an alcoholic . 
and we got divorced back in the midseventies 
and that left me with three teenagers . 
but at any rate , what happened was that i just absolutely put away all the credit cards . 
i didn't rip them up . 
i didn't send them back . 
i just put them away . 
because there was one that it was really handy to have . 
if i absolutely had to have something , i could go use it . 
but , uh , mostly we just spent cash . whatever we had . 
and if we didn't have it , we absolutely didn't spend it . 
but then , as things improved , you know . 
once i got them all through college , uh , it came to the point where , uh , 
my parents came through the depression . 
i'm not sure how old you are . 
well , my parents too . 
you 
 but my , 
late thirties , 
and , uh , my mother hardly ever spent anything on herself or on the house . 
and that's kind of the way i was raised . 
and so i'm not a very demanding person in that aspect . 
so for quite a period of time , i just flat didn't spend any money . 
now , meanwhile , i a building bank balance . 
and my intent was that whenever something went on sale that i really had to have , i would have the cash to buy it right then and there .
well , that's good . 
and that's the way i've operated ever since then . 
and you know , if something goes on sale and i don't have the money , i still don't buy it . 
 well , we buy what , well , 
we just got through buying a twentyfive foot refrigerator , a new ceramic top stove , and a new dishwasher . 
oh my .
 and we put twentyeight hundred dollars on the charge . along with my trip to japan 
oh my! 
and you know . 
 oh my . 
i mean , we got a monster , you know , bill coming in . 
interest being paid . 
and we pay it off as it goes . 
and that's the way i do my credit cards now . 
so we never really get that much uh , over extended . 
i do almost all my purchasing on credit cards . 
but it's the fact that i have enough of a cushion in the bank so that when they come , i can pay them in full . 
we're doing that . 
we have , you know , uh , 
our big , uh , 
we did redecorating . 
in the family room and new carpet . 
i mean we just 
 oh my . 
 well i , 
we've had two kids in college that 
so you know , we don't have that . 
and it all looks still pretty good to me . 
why we need to replace it ? 
to , i mean 
that rug is thirteen years old , 
why not replace it . 
but , uh , too late , we'll never find that out . 
this is so funny . 
that's wonderful . 
i mean , certain things really do need to be done whether or not you think they should ,
you know , i don't spend that much money . 
uh , we just sort of have had , uh , you know , too many obligations to , you know , 
we sort of take care of the kids when they were school and they got through school . 
and that was the major , you know , decade of expenses , you know . 
so we feel as , uh , 
but as far as any formal budgeting , uh , you know , we just apparently have been very fortunate . 
when we want to go out to eat , we go out to eat . 
we never really , you know , have to program money for that or make choices , you know . 
but , uh , we don't have that uproarious a lifestyle . 
after all , we're , 
how has it been this week for you ? 
weatherwise . 
damp , cold , warm .
 oh , no , 
damp . 
we have gone through , what might be called the four seasons , uh , in the last week . 
we have had highs of seventytwo , lows in the twenties . 
my goodness . 
well , i don't even want to tell you what ours has been like then . 
it was ninetysix yesterday , 
i heard about that . 
 and we set a record yesterday . uh , very windy , 
but then today the wind has dropped off , and also , the temperature , very cool , uh , 
i think right now it's like sixtynine , 
and that's cool for u , 
or it feels cool compared to yesterday , but very pleasant , 
no rain in the last month , i don't think . 
the ground's very dry 
and our yard work , everything is in bloom , 
so our yard work is pretty tough , the ground being dry , 
but i guess it also , uh , brings about allergies , 
we're having a lot of allergies down here right now . 
everything blooming , 
and the weather . 
and , uh , i think a lot of people have contracted , uh , spring fever too , 
so . had a lot of people out at work , you know , for fishing , uh , 
the blue flu , 
the blue flu , or the white collar flu , depending on where you work , i guess . 
oh , uh , as i've said , we have had variable weather . uh , 
it has been untypically wet for this time of year , 
and , also , we have a lot of green , you know , 
the grass has been growing 
and if you look outside , you would like to go out and mow your lawn ,
but fortunately it rains 
and you , uh , do not have to go out and buy the spark plug ,
but , we've had an unusually , uh , uh , warm spring , 
and , well i guess we're still in winter , 
and , uh , 
no snow ? 
to speak of . 
we usually average , oh , anywhere from six to twelve inches during the winter 
and this year , as well as last year , we have had less than four inches total accumulation . 
so , it's been inordinately warm , uh , here , uh , for this time of year . 
so , uh , in that regard , it's fine , 
but , uh , 
i thought i heard this morning that in san antonio it was in the nineties yesterday . 
it is . 
down in the more southern and western areas . 
and , of course we are , um , about two hours from the northern border , straight south , 
and , uh , very windy . 
it's amazing to me 
because i have only lived in dallas for three years , 
and i cannot believe that the wind blows all the time . 
it does , 
very seldom , if any , 
i can't remember , you know , a day that i walked out and the wind wasn't blowing . 
well , i spent six years in graduate school in indiana . in the flatlands , 
and it was that way every day . 
rarely a day went by when the wind was less than fifteen or twenty miles an hour .
so , that , uh , 
you became accustomed to it , i guess . 
but , uh , otherwise as i said , we have had , uh , a relatively mild winter ,
oh , where did you go to school in indiana ? 
purdue . 
i have a brother that lives in , uh , uh , south bend , indiana . 
oh , yes . 
and , i had to always , 
i've lived there for eight years myself . 
i'd always said i was going to go back to school and go to notre dame . 
but , i didn't . uh . 
well , you are not from that area originally , i can tell . 
originally i'm from new mexico . 
oh , okay . 
i was born in new mexico 
and we lived in , uh , south bend for eight years , and , uh , then moved to , uh , tennessee actually . 
and , uh , 
well , i thought i heard a little tennessee in there somewhere . 
very much , 
cause i spent thirteen years there .
you've moved around as much as i have .
yeah , uh , 
my father was in the air force , 
oh , i see . 
well , i worked for the government , 
so i moved , uh , much more frequently than i had intended for sixteen years , 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , uh , is there any , 
oh . o , 
uh , do you work for texas instruments ? 
i work for g t e . 
oh , okay . 
i've known jack for some time . 
i'm in the speech processing business ,
oh , okay . 
well , actually , i work for texas instruments , 
and , uh , i'm an environmental engineer , 
oh , i see . 
i'm sure you have a representative somewhere in the area .
we haven't talked much about the weather .
oh , well . 
let's see , i can't , 
in environmental engineering , uh , 
is that with regard to work place engineering , or just , you know , the work place environment 
oh , i see . 
taking care of uh , 
i'm actually in the air division , 
and we monitor , um , anything that comes out of a stack , or out of a building , 
or , um , we do have customers that , um , their concerns are in the work place 
and we take care of that , 
but    ,
well , i had 
oh , uhhuh . 
and so , uh , i had thought a little bit about it , um , 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , i , 
but that's interesting . 
i have a , uh , uh , friend who is a planner .
oh , uhhuh . 
and , one of his , 
and he models , uh , city districts , and so forth ,
and , one of the , uh , 
he or gets inputs from , uh , an environmental engineer .   .
actually , our division is corporate wide , 
and we take care of just the dallas area . 
of course we have several plants here , 
but , um , we do air modeling also . 
oh , i see . 
and , yeah , i take care of all the air modeling , specifically for the dallas area . 
what we do , we have a weather station , that we get all of this information , you know , temperature , wind speed , wind direction , 
and , uh , we have a huge chemical data base . 
well , that's interesting . 
and , uh , our chemical data base , so that we know every chemical on site 
and , um , its concentration , 
and we'd be able to track chemicals from that building with our weather station . 
uh , what do you think you would offer as far as , uh , information about selecting a school ? 
well , first i think they've got to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do . 
uh , once they have that , then they can start looking in all the various publications that give out all the information about schools and write to the schools themselves , and start finding out about the different requirements for the programs and what kind uh , of job assistance and all that other kind of stuff they offer . 
yeah , uh , 
that the , um , 
depending upon the field , i know there are some fields which a person should go to that school , all four years , 
but i know there are some fields where it's really not necessary . 
a lot fields are , 
most of your liberal arts degrees and stuff aren't really concerned with your first two years anyway . 
general education requirements . 
um , i don't know what advice i'd give them . 
go to the school you'd like to go to . 
i didn't care about the program or anything else . 
i went where i wanted to go . 
what was your degree in ? 
uh , political science . 
political science , oh , 
well , i know , i'm going to school right now , 
and , uh , i have a friend , 
where are you at ? 
uh , u t d . 
university of texas , dallas . 
well , yeah , 
i'm in ,
i know . 
that's where texas instruments is . 
um , something i think that i've noticed that 
i have a friend , 
i think if you're going into like , uh , law or medicine , a very particular , very specific field , you can meet a lot of the requirements at a public , um , institution . 
and , uh , it's a lot cheaper . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , in sending my sister to a private institution for the first two years . 
and she found out after that , 
she said , you know , my parents , they really wasted a lot of money . 
this is about twenty years ago . 
but , uh , well , right now i just , 
i mean as far as i feel that , uh , a lot of it depends upon the major . 
it does . um , 
i didn't know what i wanted to do after i got my degree . 
um , originally i had planned , uh , undergrad degree in political science and then a master's in public administration . 
and i went ahead and pursued that . 
i didn't want it . 
um , and from that point i went to law school . 
and after a year and a half of that i decided i didn't want that either .
haven't figured out what i want to be when i grow up . 
i really did enjoy the law . 
i mean , that's where i wanted to be , 
but i didn't want to go through uh , the hassle that the law schools put you through , because i never did want to be a practicing attorney . 
i just wanted a law degree . 
and i've since discovered that i would be far better off being in the paralegal field .
and you don't have to put up with all the b s that the lawyers have to . 
so that's what i'm pursuing right now 
 and i'm pretty happy with it so far . 
what's called an interdisciplinary field . 
i'm a speech therapy major 
 and fortunately i have a good medical background , 
that's probably very useful . 
more useful than what i thought . 
and , um , i also have a good languages background , linguistics .
so , it's all working together . 
the only field i'm not familiar with really is education , which   requires about four or five different fields 
oh , good grief . 
so it's a , 
i thought at one time i wanted to be a teacher , 
but i quickly dispelled that idea when i became a substitute teacher for a while , just to get my feet wet . 
no way . 
maybe being a tenured professor would be one thing , but being a public school teacher is entirely another thing . 
oh , so you are a disgruntled graduate student .
i am just a disgruntled person all around .
 uh , i'm the , uh , original , uh , mister scrooge , i guess . 
i just , 
i think , 
there is , 
a fine profession , fine field to go into . 
um , i know one time i was in a political science class , 
and you know , talking about fields , people going into different fields , i made an off the cuff remark about lawyers ,
and i mean , oh , that was like a can of worms . 
you probably got everybody on you , because they were probably all going to law school . 
there was a woman , 
and it was just .
well , that remark in itself is a slam .
my best friends are lawyers .
i know . 
you know , like , like , uh , my best friends are blacks .
or jewish , 
it used to be jewish , you know . 
jewish , 
now blacks 
 and i , guess iraqi now is the .
i know , 
law was a lot of fun until you get to law school 
 and it doesn't become fun anymore . 
i have a friend . 
she's going into law , 
another friend going into law , 
and , she's , 
i'm really concerned about , you know , 
she's just going to be , you know , 
what's going to happen when she gets there . 
you going , 
you know , all of her dreams will be dispelled .
oh , yeah . 
if you've ever seen the program paper chase 
i think it's probably more embarrassing and very painful . 
it is . 
i see 
very much so . 
it's a lot of that . um 
 it was enjoyable for a while , um , 
but it's such a grind 
 and you begin to wonder , you know , 
if i'm not , i mean , 
you really have to be dead set on being a lawyer to do it . 
if you have any doubts whatsoever , you better not get into it . 
i mean , i wasted a year and a half of awfully hard , 
and i aged ten years . 
but i wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world . 
it never hurts to have some kind of a grounding in law . 
i went to a language school , 
i guess , uh , united states institution . 
i was military at the time .
and i think 
what branch were you in ? 
i was in the air force ? 
i was too . 
for myself , i mean , i think that military experience was fine , 
that i could have done , you know , with , 
well , i got tired of the service after a while , i mean 
i had a terrific job , really enjoyed it . 
what was your job ? 
uh , command post . 
uh , i was a linguist .
i was just wondering , were you in sac by any chance ? .
uh , no 
oh , okay , 
i thought maybe you might have had some experience with the , uh , r c one thirtyfives . 
i didn't go flight crew . 
matter of fact , i didn't make it completely through that field . 
i , was in intelligence school and about three weeks short . 
i didn't make it , 
i sort of washed out . 
after about eighteen months of talking about the 
i think that's why , you know , children really need to think about the field they're going into , and i mean , spend a lot of serious 
that's right , 
and it , 
 and they should study it . 
 i think there's a lot to be said for kids working 
i mean , just how much of a people person they are . 
that's true , 
i found that out when i was in high school . 
i worked at mcdonald's . 
oh , and i tell you what , 
i worked at mcdonald's as well , 
and i can tell you one thing , 
there are just some people that i , you know , 
you just came to the point where i mean , 
and oh , i eventually worked as a lab technician , 
and i worked front desk . 
and i mean , somebody could walk in the door , 
and i knew exactly what they were going to do and say . 
i was the same way too . 
i'm not a people person . 
i hate , um , having to play such a nice guy .
it's just not for me . 
 uh , i deal much better in research and books , and stuff like that 
that's good . 
i was just wondering , um , getting back to the school thing , i almost wish that there was something  . . . 
what kind of a car do you drive now ? 
i drive a honda prelude . 
do you ? 
i drive a honda accord . 
oh , yeah .
i bought mine a year ago 
 so i'm not buying a car any time soon . 
me either . 
i just bought mine , uh , 
it will be a year in august . 
i love it though . 
i love hondas . 
i think i found my car . 
well , i like where all the controls are 
oh , really , 
i have a standard . 
but , um , 
 an it's supposedly real reliable 
the only thing i've ever heard about hondas is that the breaks go out first . 
oh , really ? 
i hadn't heard that . 
what did you have before you bought that . 
i had a buick regal . 
did you ? 
i had , uh , a mazda r x seven before that 
and that was the worse car i've ever driven in my life . 
the buick was great . 
it was nine years old 
and it ,
the only problems i had with it in the nine years that i owned it , i had to replace the compressor when it was about seven years old . 
and that was the only major problem that i had , i mean , 
i had like little piddly things like 
and i had replaced the tires 
and , uh , seems like it had a radiator leak once . 
but i never had any major anything ,
i really never had anything major with my mazda 
but it was a standard also 
and the clutch went out on it toward the end , 
i had it five years 
and the last two years it seemed to go out really easily . 
i think it went out twice in two years 
and that's a lot 
it shouldn't go out that much . 
and so i went ahead and bought another standard when i bought the honda 
but i don't think i'm going to do that again . 
i think i'm going back to automatic now . 
well , i never , well , 
i kind of know how to drive standard 
but i've never owned one 
so i don't drive one a lot . 
so , i don't feel comfortable in traffic with it . 
and for everything i've heard it's a lot easier to sell an automatic . 
it is . 
that's true . 
it is me too 
that's why i got the honda . 
hondas have great resale value . 
the mazda definitely did not .
not at all . 
they're worse than american cars i think or just as bad as far as resale goes . 
i did pretty well with my , uh , regal because it was in really good shape 
the interior was still really nice , 
there wasn't cracks all over the dash board and stuff . 
and it had some nice features . 
 so i ended up okay with the buick , 
and i anticipate the same thing with the honda whenever i decide to sell it , 
of course , i may never sell it  , 
i may drive it until it's dead 
that's what i did with the mazda , drive it until the clutch went out and the wheels fell off , 
so , probably what i'll do again . 
but i really like the hondas . 
i like foreign cars 
i looked at the mitsubishi galant . 
i was looking for a four door car having driven the r x seven so long , 
and it was so small 
and it's really impractical . 
so , i wanted something with a real trunk , and four doors something easy to get in and out of 
and i looked at the galant 
and those were really nice 
and i can get them for a great price . 
but i found it hard to deal with the dealership i was going through . 
so , that's how i ended up with a honda . 
i wasn't even looking for a car when i bought this car . 
 uh , i was thinking about buying a prelude from a friend who was moving to new york or something 
 and she was going to sell her car because she didn't need it anymore 
and it was only like a year old 
and i had never driven , uh , a prelude . 
so , i went to a dealership because they had like , uh , the same year and same model ,
and i went and i test drove it 
and , you know , i just fell in love ,
oh , yeah . 
they're nice i think . 
and i ,
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah . 
i have to have them loaded , 
um , i love all those little things that you don't need 
but they're so wonderful . 
i went there looking at a used car 
and two days later i bought this car . 
that was largest impulse that i , 
the two ,
i understand . 
i go for the big stuff . 
i noticed .
mine was definitely not impulse 
i really needed a new car . 
mine was just , it was getting worn out i guess from being a sports car . 
i drove it kind of hard , 
and i got it right after high school . 
so , by the time i traded it in it was ready . 
i got , 
did you ? 
but i guess this wasn't really an impulse , i mean , 
buying it right then and , you know , right quickly was kind of impulsive 
but i'd been thinking about buying a new car for about three years 
and i was just scared to . 
i was scared to start taking on payments because the buick was long since paid for . 
that's the same with me . 
would you ever buy a used car for a new car for yourself ? 
i was going to buy one once 
but i worry about who's driven them and what they've been through and the warranties and things like that . 
just , i can't seem to get over that . 
that just bothers me 
i don't know why . 
well , um , like on hondas they , 
supposedly , the maintenance records was supposed to be registered with honda or whatever 
and you can request whatever maintenance records exist on cars 
and you can have them checked out by mechanics and stuff . 
that's true . 
i mean they can't stop you from doing it . 
hoping that they do go to a honda dealership to get them serviced . 
well , and even if they didn't , you can still get a good idea if you can get a good mechanic to ,
that's true . 
well , i enjoyed talking to you . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
anyway , what are your first comments on that subject ? 
uh , my first comments on the budget . 
i would say there has , 
what would you start cutting f , 
what would be the first thing you'd cut ? 
defense ? 
surprisingly , no . 
mean private enterprise ? 
you mean the prisons ? 
they're already talking about it . 
i mean , they're talking about , uh , having it , uh , as a , you know , business . uh , you know , the government doesn't have to deal with it . 
i hadn't heard that . 
but , uh , yeah , 
because i think it's all funded , either state or federally funded 
but to me it , 
they think they need to , maybe have , uh , you know , private enterprise come in . 
well , see the other way i'm thinking about is they should be selfsupporting , like , uh , the prisoners make license plates or farm or small industry inside the prisons . anything to where they can be selfsupporting within themselves . 
in other words , they're in there for a purpose , 
put them to work 
it's the same thing like the whole i shouldn't say criminal , but the whole police department of the united states . 
i feel the same way . 
uh , someone gets picked up for drunk driving , 
he should put enough in there that goes back into paying for that policeman being out there . 
so it's you know , selfdefense on that point . 
uh , as far as my defense budget , uh , they're cutting it back now , what , twentyfive percent ? 
i wouldn't want to see it cut any more than that . 
but again i'd like to see something on the other end back into education . but not in the education we have today . 
so i'm lost on that one . 
i would like to be a little more into investigating some of the other countries in the world and their educational problems . and to come up with something a little better than what we've got . 
its tough uh , you know , what , uh , 
as far as this , that good or bad or what . 
but , uh , i was just talking to somebody else , 
and all those european countries , they pay all the way through college and stuff like that . 
so , uh , 
well , not so much pay . 
i'm not trying to see the government put out any more . 
i know what you are saying . 
but i'm just saying that even the differences , uh , is that , you know , some countries pay for students to go through college and etcetera . 
but here , you know , it's just up to high school . 
but see , we don't even push the fact to the high school kids that there's other means of education out there rather than college . to go either as an apprentice , which they do in other countries . just doing it , which i think would bring the education back up . you know , 
why not an apprentice out to a company and learn from down on the bottom as a wood worker or , you know , just a technician ? 
you can learn on the job .
our education budget will go down if this is , 
in a few years , i mean it's not going to be overnight . 
but that would come down . 
i think you know , that's one reason , uh , you know , we do have the education is that what it takes for these companies to bring somebody on board . uh , 
they're not willing you know , 
so , uh , it's , you know , as far as the technical side . 
but , uh , even like 
one of the biggest things now is like paralegals and stuff . 
i mean they're trying to get more people into that field . 
but they can't just bring somebody in without even having gone to , you know , school in that area before they can work , you know , for a lawyer as a paralegal . 
excuse me . i see it being done .
i know of a friend that works for my lawyer that has had no training whatsoever 
and she's training her . 
well , yeah , 
you know , i'm assuming that it can be done . uh , 
my perspective is that , you know , i've been with a couple of big companies now . 
and it's like they'd , are unwilling to put the time in . 
you know , they want somebody , you know , bring them in , that they have something , you know , a certain amount to contribute . 
obviously , uh , you know , there's a lot to learn , uh , after that . 
but , uh , that's true .
i'm sure there's a lot of , uh , 
you know , businesses are you know , small businesses that could , uh . 
anyway , so , uh , 
 but , uh , you know , i think , uh , maybe they need to , uh , help promote that more . give incentives like , uh , if they do bring somebody on , they will pay some of their costs or give tax breaks or whatever it is , you know , for them to train people ,
i don't know , you know , what kind of options they've got . 
well , that's something about what germany's supposed to be doing . something similar to that right now . 
and , uh , they have jobs out on , you know , bulletin boards so people know what is open for an apprentices in different fields . 
but see , that again would cut some of our budget down for education but build up our education with the people . at high school level , 
they go on the unemployment list before we have turn around .
i don't mean college . 
and i'm for college . 
but there's a lot of people that don't want their higher education as far as quote college is concerned . 
they've had it . 
i think , i just heard something the other day , 
it was like only , it was either sixty percent or forty percent , go to college . 
and then out of that percentage , only so many can get their degree . 
so , i thought that was interesting . 
but , uh , you know , most people i knew have gone and got their degree . 
oh , yeah . 
but there's a lot of them out there that haven't . 
well , you know , i , 
and yeah , 
so i think , uh , that demographic area there , you know , a lot of them do go on . 
and they go to college , etcetera . 
because you can get just as far as being a journeyman , carpenter or an electrician or plumber or anything else like that . make as much money 
and if they enjoy it more , they'll make a lo , happier life for themselves . 
you threw that question on me about the deficit , 
put it on your shoe now . 
what would you do ? 
well , you know , the deficit , that's a whole nother , uh , my perception of the budget , you know , the government . 
and they have so much to spend 
and there's not enough money to spread around . 
but the deficit basically is that the trade surplus between the other countries , and that we have you know , more money going out and too many goods coming into this country , you know . 
 and , uh , you know , part of that problem , i think , is still , you know , uh , 
like japan still does not let us compete fairly in their country . 
the demand for their goods is quite high here , 
 so they can get their goods in here . 
and , uh , you know , to start even that out we need to continue to , you know , at least threaten that , you know , 
we're going to give them higher tariffs , etcetera to raise their prices to , you know , ours . 
but , uh , it's just that , uh , they're , eh , 
i think you're going to find that just because the united states , you know , there is such a demand here , the market , you know . 
and , uh , uh , the you know , we don't , uh , sell products abroad as much as we bring in . 
were you watching , 
i think , uh , 
one of the news stations . i couldn't even tell you which one i watched . but they had on there , where the output from the united states was basically from smaller businesses rather than the larger ones are exporting . 
what kind of puppy you got ? 
well , uh , i think she's mostly german shepherd . 
uh , she was , uh , uh , 
a person lives across the street from me , uh , brought her home from work because a coworker of hers , uh , had this dog appear on its front doorstep , 
somebody abandoned her 
this young 
and she's almost housebroken . 
i mean she actually asks to go out . 
that's great . 
and , uh , yeah 
i was amazed . 
really good temperament and very playful and affectionate , good personality . 
i don't know , 
i can't imagine what , uh , would have been wrong with this dog , 
well i have a dog that god gave us too , .
she just appeared . 
oh , really . 
but we've had her now for about three years , 
and i just , 
you get so attached to them . 
oh , yeah . 
i had a , uh , 
last year i had another german shepherd , 
now this one was purebred 
and , uh , when he was about seven months old got a gastrointestinal virus and was just about on death's door 
but , uh , managed to get him to a veterinarian in time , 
uh , and on huge doses of antibiotics ,
um , but he had actually was able to get him over that . 
and then he was gaining weight again , was just getting healthy , 
and , uh , he put on about fifteen to twenty pounds after the thing 
and then he got hit by a cadillac . 
oh no . 
so , i couldn't believe it . 
that was really hard . 
oh , gee . 
and that was even harder for , 
i was on a business trip at the time 
and the dog was being house sit , or dog sit , whatever , by some friends of mine down the street , 
so they just felt absolutely awful . 
oh , i bet . 
and i than for me 
because , oh gosh i think she loved that dog more than i did 
and , uh . 
oh gosh . 
but , uh , it's unfortunate , 
but now , i've got another one , 
how long has it been since the first one ? 
uh , see , it was just over a year . 
uh , yeah , 
uh , it was in march of last year . 
so , uh , yeah , 
didn't have one for a whole year . 
well i had a german shepherd before this one 
and when she died it just absolutely destroyed me . 
i mean i was just ,  , you know , 
i couldn't even talk about it for months 
i'm not going to do this anymore .
and then god gave me this dog , 
my dad's like that , 
 uh , he had a beagle that he loved 
and , uh , when that beagle passed away , uh , he wasn't going to have another dog , 
there's no way , 
the beagle died in i guess about october 
and by christmas time we went down to the uh , got another one , a stray . 
and she turned out to be a great dog 
and we had her for six years until she just passed away recently 
and again dad went through the whole thing , 
well you just do , 
you can't help 
it's like a kid . 
it is . 
well hopefully this one here , cocoa will live a full life .
well when , uh , 
she's mostly golden retriever . 
the vet called her , uh , a golden mix  , 
like who knows , you know . 
but uh , she's that sort of strawberry blonde reddish color , you know . 
uh , and her nose is that pink , you know , 
she doesn't have a brown nose , 
and she's sort of unicolor , you know , 
so . i named her rosebud , 
and , uh , a friend of mine said , that she gre , 
this friend of mine grew up on a farm and said that she had , uh , a pet cow named rosebud 
and she said there's a lot of longevity in that name , 
that's not too bad . 
golly the golden retrievers are good dogs too , 
they're kind of like , get that permanent smile to them , 
they're always happy . 
i don't think i've ever seen them not look happy . 
and she's so easy going and so sociable , 
you know , she loves everybody . 
and little kids can just , you know , maul all over her , 
and she just , you know , thinks it's great . 
this friend of mine has , th , well 
it's the same guy that was watching , uh , my german shepherd when he got hit , 
but , uh , went fishing with him on friday and took , 
he's got a pure bred golden retriever 
and then i had , uh , the puppy , a little tiny puppy 
and we went and took the two dogs up fishing . 
and this , 
they had a ball romping around , 
and , you know , you can't get a golden retriever near water without it jumping in . 
getting in , 
and , uh , this golden retriever jumped in the , really fast moving , uh , river current , 
and , uh . 
oh , no . 
well no , 
actually he had no trouble at all . 
he first jumped in 
and i , 
he's just about a year old himself and never had really , 
i don't think he'd swum before . 
but he jumped the river . 
did puppy go to ? 
well the puppy jumped into some of the pools but not into the , 
i was careful to keep her away from the , 
oh , that's good , 
'cause if she fell in then i'd had to go in after her . 
and up here the water's probably about forty degrees right now . 
and i would not have been fun trying to retrieve her , 
and then , 
and he was swimming for quite a bit , all afternoon . 
he loved it . 
cocoa didn't think too much of it , though . 
she jumped in and then started screaming and made me pull her back out . 
i pulled her out and , uh , then had to wrap her up in a sweatshirt because she was shivering so bad , 
but , uh , she got over it , 
well the german shepherd that i had before , 
we had a little pool , 
and , uh , she did not want any part of swimming 
but she liked to get in the pool on the first step . 
she'd just get on the first step and lay down .
and she'd just lay there on that step and just , you know , cool off .
a big lake here , um , 
it's on oneida lake 
and i'm wondering uh , if she'll want to go out there and go swimming next year . 
i mean , i've got , 
the yard's all fenced in 
so she doesn't run loose , 
but , uh , 
well the one that we had just didn't want any part of that . 
oh really . 
oh baths . 
oh gee , she hated baths worse than anything . 
it was just really a fight to , you know , get her clean . 
have you seen , uh , canine .
you've got to see it . especially since you have a german , 
it is so cute . 
oh really . 
and it's just hysterical . 
oh , okay , 
my dog , last german shepherd , it was a real chore trying to give him a bath too . 
and that was the thing i couldn't figure out 
because he would go in the lake , 
it wasn't like he didn't 
normally , i mean he didn't seem to have a problem with getting wet , 
but if you wanted to get him wet , forget it . 
well that's how cleo , w , you know , 
she'd lay on her step , 
but that was the only time she wanted to get wet 
and she didn't want you getting her wet .
but you really need to see that movie . 
we bought the movie 
and i don't know how many times i've seen it . 
and it came on t v the other night 
and i was watching it again , 
and my husband heard me laughing 
i saw the , uh , previews for it and all 
and it did look like it'd be a good movie , 
it is great . 
uh , really haven't had a whole lot of time to get out to see the movies lately . 
but , i got to do more fun things . 
well we always wait until we can rent them , you know .
well uh , i'm a second lieutenant in the air force 
and so i travel a lot . 
oh really . 
and yeah , 
but it's nice having a dog here , uh , 
oh , yeah , 
there's just , 
un , uh , 
what's the word i'm looking for , uh , lots of affection , no co , 
that's it . 
not critical at all . 
they're really wonderful . 
well , it's been nice talking to you , 
in fact , i'm graduating from college in about a week 
and this past semester i've taken two criminal justice classes and have discussed a lot on trials . 
uh , well then you must know a lot more about this than i do .
 uh , you know , is fine . 
i think it should be by a jury . 
i don't think the judge should have , i mean 
he's just there kind of like the referee .
uh , i don't even think that it should be unanimous either . uh , 
well , what about the idea that one is only guilty , uh , when proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt ? 
i thought that was the point of , uh , a unanimous jury was the idea that if everyone agrees 
but , if there are some people who don't agree 
uh , i don't know . 
i , uh , 
in , uh , prison , uh , falsely accused 
but , uh , more than likely the people that are on the jury know what they're doing . 
uh , i mean you , 
have you served on a jury ? 
i never have either , 
but my few friends who have , uh , say just the opposite .
they say they're , uh , remarkably incompetent . and , uh , don't know what they're doing and say one thing in the courtroom and then as soon as they get in the back room they just start letting all their prejudices hang out to air , and all that . 
huh . well , you would think that they would get that in the , uh , 
when the prosecution and defense are choosing the jury you would think that those would come out 
and i know they automatically , 
a professor in criminal justice or something like that , 
that you're automatically , 
they don't want you on the jury . 
   , they don't want 
and they tend , 
and since anyone can get out of it who basically says they don't want to do it , 
i mean , you know , it's anyone can get out of jury just about , 
 uh , it's not really my peers that , 
let's say i were arrested falsely or not 
i mean i'd be tried by a jury of  , you know , people who had nothing else to do and weren't very knowledgeable about certain sorts of things , 
and , uh , 
i get a little bit nervous about it , 
and , uh , 
 , i've never even been called to jury duty . 
i was called once , 
but i was out of the country , 
and apparently they thought i served 
 so i didn't make any noise about it .
i came back 
and they said the record showed i served , 
but i was out of the country at the time , 
so i'm pretty sure i didn't . 
 uh , i don't know , 
i guess there's a lot of problems with the legal system .
well , i don't know , 
i definitely feel like we need to keep it at least unanimous 
because , uh , you know , there's the classic sort of to kill a mockingbird kind of story where you get , you know , 
and , uh , it seems to me that if you could just have a simple majority or something you could pretty much you know , browbeat the jury ,
that's hard to say . 
and , uh , let's throw the rascal in jail and stuff . 
and you also get a lot of , uh , juries are extremely , uh , 
and from what i hear , 
witness testimony 
and they say that , uh , juries are extremely vulnerable to , uh , sort of emotional pitches , you know , 
the prosecutor will want to , oh , i don't know the nice person he was and what a family life , and basically get the jury to be very sympathetic with the victim , 
harming some individual or something like that , they get very much , well , you know , 
it's just a big faceless corporation . 
so , not , 
i mean , i'm , 
the problem is i can't guarantee that a judge would necessarily be much better than a jury , 
but i'd be real nervous having a jury not at least fully agree on what the settlements would be ,
i don't think the judge should just make the decision alone . 
least with the jury you have twelve people , you know 
well , how about having a jury and a judge work together on it somehow ? 
i wonder if that's possible ? 
i guess the judge's time is worth too much , though . 
he makes more money in an hour than all twelve of them put together . 
but , uh , no , 
the people , though , that 
somebody's life is in twelve people's hands 
and sometimes those twelve people could care less . 
the defense in thinking that they're , you know , 
because when they go through those processes they kind of pick out who they want . 
oh , of course . 
it's political maneuvering . 
the one side is looking for someone whose face they think will , you know , want to hang everyone , 
and the other one is going to look for someone very sympathetic . 
they're not looking for someone who's going to be the most reasoned or sensible or rational juror . *[[whose who's
neither side wants that . 
they want to find a juror that's going to , uh , be most persuadable by their arguments , you know . 
uh , i wish it were a little bit harder to not serve on juries actually . 
i mean , i know , it's tricky 
because i know , you know , an awful lot of intelligent people who just , well 
i'm too busy to serve on a jury , 
 so i'll tell them that 
and they you know , just answer one of the questions the wrong way because you can do that , you know , 
 oh , yeah . 
i guess it's just that maybe people are , you know , upset at court , you know . 
a family member of theirs , though that was innocent 
and , then they'd want to be on that jury . 
course , they would be barred , 
but  , 
 but , uh , i think if everyone took it seriously 
well it sounds like we both need to get out there and serve on a jury . 
i hope we're called up before too long . 
i would love to be called , 
i'm ready to go .
they just haven't called me up yet .
they will eventually . 
well it was nice talking with you . 
it was nice talking to you . 
have you ever been drug tested ? 
 and they did a full blood screen on me , 
but they didn't call that a drug test . 
so tha , 
i think they checked for drugs . 
they just don't tell you they did . 
i've had , uh , 
i had one at t i and then one at another engineering company . 
and , really , i mean , i don't mind them . 
i don't do drugs anyway . 
i guess if i did , maybe i would 
but , um , i don't know . 
i know a girl that , she's a nurse , 
and they get drug tested randomly . 
but that would probably bother me to wake up one day and find out halfway through the day that you're going to be drug tested and you didn't know about it . 
well , i guess it depends on if you got something to worry about .
i guess so . 
do you think that it's right ? 
and i've done employee assistant work 
and i know the kind of cost businesses go through in terms of accidents ,
and it's like in the billions of dollars every year . um , 
and is , you know , making sure that the employees are drug and alcohol free . 
that's true . 
and , you know , that people are , 
like if your boss is your drinking buddy or whatever , i mean , you can come to work drunk and get in an accident 
and he'll cover up for you 
but you know , ends up costing the company lots and lots of money . 
that's true . 
i believe , 
  you know   , 
i think anyone in a public job like bus drivers , and cab drivers , and 
i think they should be 
i believe ,
i don't know that i believe every secretary in every company needs to be . 
you know , secretaries aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something . 
so , i don't know . 
i'm kind of biased , too , because i don't do drugs 
well , there , 
it's , i think one of the problems with it is it affects a lot of other folks on the job 
it does . 
because ,   generally you know it . 
uh , you find out one way or another if somebody's got a problem on the job . 
that's true . 
and like you say , even if it's just the secretary , 
if her work or abilities start affecting her coworkers 
that's true . 
but , what do you do about ,
and , you know , it's been the whole weekend since they've done anything 
and they happen to be tested monday morning 
and they could be fired for that ? 
you know , that's kind of unfair , also . 
 well , yeah  .
i guess it comes with the turf . 
i guess so . 
i guess if you're going to do it you need to suffer the consequences .
and , in terms of drugs , they're illegal . 
so you're , 
that's true . 
that's true . 
probably of assessing for alcohol . 
that's true . 
and that's probably the biggest problem there is .
i think so , more than drugs .
and i know a lot of companies that will put you in an alcohol rehabilitation before they would put you in a drug rehab . 
they would pay for an alcohol 
 but they don't always pay for drug rehabilitation . 
well , i guess that's one of the positive things that have come out of it , some of the employee assistance program . 
if you do test positive for something 
that's true . 
and i , 
i think the company benefits in the long run . 
that's true .
what kind of testing do they do when you went ? 
uh , it's a urine test . 
urine screen . 
it was really very official . 
you have to go in a room solely by yourself , sign papers that say you were totally alone , sign papers that say this is yours , 
and you have to seal the bottle yourself and label it yourself and ,
so that they're sure that you haven't borrowed anybody's , i guess , or something . 
well , that happens . 
i know , 
it's hard to believe , 
it happens a lot . 
but i guess it does .
i know . 
i'm amazed , 
it is amazing . 
i guess there are people that do that . 
and those are expensive tests . 
it depends how strong a test it is . 
they've got different degrees ,
i guess so . 
they got some unusual things besides blood and urine tests . 
they've   some companies that are doing , uh , hair tests . 
oh , really ? 
well , that , 
they'll pull out one of your hairs 
and they can apparently test , um , back a certain period of time .
how weird . 
i didn't know that . 
it's kind of , 
oh , that's weird . 
hair follicles , i guess , are just dead protein 
and they , 
 and a calendar . 
they've got it pretty precise now . 
they can go back and look at , in terms of growth and that type of thing . 
that's wild . 
so  , 
it's amazing the things on your body . 
so , i guess if they perfect that   is not quite as cumbersome as having to go fill a bottle or 
that's true .
 that's true . 
i'm glad i never had to do it by giving blood . 
 i can't stand the thought of giving blood . 
i can't even do it for wadley , even though it's a good cause .
 well , i enjoyed talking to you . 
well , i did , too . 
thank you . 
so tell me about china cry . 
china cry was basically a native chinese , uh , uh , who was raised by christian parents . 
and her time frame was prior to the nineteen fortynine revolution . 
i see . 
although she , herself , had never really accepted jesus or gone through any of the other , uh , christian , uh , portions of the faith , repentance , baptisms , et cetera , et cetera . she had always felt a very strong , uh , leaning in this direction . 
and whenever the cultural revolution of nineteen fortynine occurred and most churches were either banned or the christian movement . 
 , anyway , as she grew up towards maturity , her parents , well , 
her dad was a doctor 
 well , you know , rather well to do in the old regime 
and the communist chinese didn't like this at all . 
you know , the bourgeoisie out of , uh , style , then . 
everybody was back to a commonality of one . 
and so they kept picking at him , picking at her mother and , uh , finally , uh , started picking on her .
they were starting to , uh , accuse her and had her write her own story over and over and over . 
uh , and this chinese fellow and was with child when they started this mass court . 
now , i think i'm leaving out a portion . 
as an instructor 
and they or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers .
being a child , you know . 
so , they kept on and on at her , 
and in the meantime , she and her husband , uh , their own child . 
and , uh , you know , over a period of months 
and finally they , uh , carried her , uh , out into the courtyard or , you know , executing her by firing squad . 
this is not going to happen even though this lady has not really , you know , 
she's one of mine , 
she is not going to die 
and , uh , the soldiers were blinded when they shot . 
and her life was spared . 
and uh , the commandant 
and so he called this kind of stuff off and just put her in the labor camp . 
well , uh , and , course , here's this woman who is heavy with child dragging rocks around . 
well going to , uh , 
and her husband had escaped to hong kong , uh , 
and then she put in to go see him . 
and over time she , uh , uh , 
finally , through her perseverance and writing enough letters to enough different people embarrassed enough of bureaucracy that they finally let her go . 
and , of course , she had to walk . 
you know , the clothes on her back . 
and other child that they'd already had 
and they knew that she wasn't going to come back , 
but yeah , she did , years later when the , uh , liberalization , you know , in real life 
and , uh , she was not persecuted or anything else like that . 
huh . interesting story . 
it was . 
uh , very moving , too . 
 uh , i don't even remember seeing that advertised 
and it was probably here and gone fairly quickly . 
well , it was within , oh , ninety days . 
oh . that recent . 
i mean it was advertised over a period of about ninety days . 
oh , i see what you mean . 
but it wasn't , 
uh , they didn't have it in , uh , too awfully many movie houses , 
but it was , in the , 
it had large , uh , uh , uh , press release . 
well , uh , i guess what i saw most recently and luckily i saw it only a week ago so i'd remember 
uh , my husband and i had this great desire to go see a comedy 
and , uh , we ended up going to see green card . 
and , uh , he chose it 
and , uh , it's got this wonderful french actor who's , 
it was like , his , 
and he's been a star in france and a wonderful actor who we've enjoyed for years , 
but he's never made an american film . 
this was his american film debut 
oh , i see , 
 and he speaks very broken english . 
and basically he played , uh , a frenchman who married an american girl , uh , in a marriage of convenience 
and , uh , because she could claim she was married , she could get , uh , an apartment or a condominium in a very exclusive building in new york that had an outside garden , which is very unusual there . 
so she was a horticulturist , 
and that was sort of her dream . 
oh , i see , 
of course , you know , they got married 
and they never saw each other again . 
except fate through them together *[[through threw
and the immigration and naturalization service , uh , started investigating . 
so they had to get back together and get their stories straight , 
 and she was a very svelte , sophisticated urban new yorker 
 and he was on the streets and sort of pulled himself up by his bootstraps and claimed to be a composer , 
but there was no proof whatsoever that he really was . 
he'd been working in a restaurant when they met . 
 and , uh , they had to learn all about each other basically 
just then . 
and , uh , it was , 
you knew what was going to happen , of course .
well , they fell into like , at any rate 
and then he said something , because his english was so poor for the most part , 
and that clued the investigator that he had memorized a series of answers . 
so , uh , 
well , did you go to college ? 
and where did you go ? 
i went to a small liberal arts college in virginia . 
uh , it was  sweeper  college of about seven hundred and fifty students . 
i had gone to a small school growing up , uh , 
and a lot of my friends went to university of michigan 
but my parents were retiring in south carolina when i graduated and , uh , were looking for a southern school 
and , uh , what about you ? 
i went to the university of minnesota . 
oh , so you're from the midwest , too . 
i am , 
where do you live now ? 
uh , i live in texas now . 
where are you ? 
well , i'm in texas . 
i'm in austin . 
oh , uh , my brother's in austin . 
uh , he lives lakeway . 
he , uh , had moved , uh , 
we're in plano . 
i'm familiar with plano . 
i visited once or twice . 
oh , austin is so pretty . 
oh , i love it . 
i really do . 
and your daughter is going to be a sophomore . 
that's correct . 
i have two daughters , 
but my oldest will be a sophomore . 
 uh , because you live in austin , is she thinking about the university of texas ? 
and , uh , you know , having gone to the university of minnesota , i know what a big university is like . 
and , uh , one thing that i did this summer , which i thought might benefit both my daughters is , my youngest daughter got involved in band , 
and baylor has a band camp . 
so she went for a week , 
and it was overnight , 
and they lived in the dorms . 
and i thought this would expose both of them to what it's , you know , like on a a smaller college campus . 
and , uh , my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school . 
so , uh , i still think the exposure was good . 
the reason i ask if you went to college is i thought , well , you know , 
what were your selection criteria . 
or , you know , there's all of these areas to look at in making the decision . 
and those were several , uh , that we did consider . 
uh , my parents , uh , certainly didn't push but wanted me to look in the south 
and because i had been in a small school , they suggested that probably , i , 
when i say small , my graduating class had eighteen in it . 
oh , wow . 
and so they suggested that i might want a smaller school because i was used to a lot of oneonone 
oh , definitely . 
and i did pick it because at the time i was interested in majoring in biology 
uh , i had had an a f s student from germany live with us our senior year 
oh , how exciting . 
 and we just thought that would be a wonderful thing 
and i ended up majoring in french . 
one of the reasons i picked the school was because they had a strong science department . 
they also had a strong language department 
and i'd always loved working with children . 
uh , and i found that i couldn't fit everything in , 
but because i had had a fair amount of french going in 
uh , and so 
oh , that was , 
several of the things you mentioned were the things that , uh , our son has talked a lot about texas a and m . 
but he thinks he wants to be a writer 
and i don't think that , 
well , then he should come to u t . 
uh , and really his graduating class will probably be in the neighborhood of eight hundred and fifty to a thousand . 
uh , and so he's used to a bigger size 
large classes . 
 uh , he would have family , close by . 
so there are advantages . uh , 
but i also , 
because i had so many friends who did go from our small school to university of michigan , which was so large 
and they really felt , uh , like they were numbers . 
oh , i went from a large high school to a large university 
and i 
you still , 
uh , i mean , it is a different feeling . 
but that was my only option . 
i mean , i just really couldn't look at anything else . 
that was the one and only thing i could really afford other than you know , a junior college , which i didn't want to do . 
so that's how , you know , my decision was made . 
but , uh , 
well , that's certainly , 
uh , especially today with the cost of college . 
i mean that is a major , uh , consideration 
and i do feel fortunate that texas has so many good schools . 
and when you mentioned that , we have friends who have children there who just love it . 
and for a private school it is not as expensive as most are 
and it is a smaller size 
and , uh , i do feel like there are a lot of options . 
but  , i had been hoping some schools i know give , uh , oh , 
even this year , jay had an aptitude test , uh , 
what does , 
he hopes to be a writer . 
but he's really strong in math and science , too , 
does your daughter know what she'd like to do ? 
oh , she has , uh , you know , interests that are just , you know , going in all directions . 
uh ,  , 
okay bethany , let's be real .
uh , she really is pretty unfocussed at this point . 
and , i don't know , 
she's taken a lot of french , 
and she may end up doing something with that . 
and i am a single mom , 
so i've been , 
and i made the mistake of dropping out of college to get married . 
so i'm trying to have my children not make the same mistake . 
by all means , go get that piece of paper , you know . 
do you just have one son ? 
i see . 
well , it sounds like he's got some really , you know , good strong ideas of what he wants to do . 
well , but he has even , 
now that he's in high school , uh , 
and , of course , there is still time , 
but he's beginning to feel that , as much as he enjoys writing , he wonders if he can make a living at it . 
you know , the , it's , 
as many years as we've been involved in one . 
i really feel fortunate in that there , even though there are problems , 
they're not a lot of problems where i teach . 
 but from talking to people in other districts there are some major problems , uh , with dropouts . 
uh , when i was in minnesota last summer 
and sometimes they didn't even show up for class 
and she taught in high school in inner city , uh , minneapolis . 
and , uh , they just didn't come to school . 
 and i cannot imagine being able to do much of anything when they don't even come to school . 
well just recently in the paper here , were articles about students , uh , working . high school students 
but then the followup the next day was , 
i was kind of glad to see , 
because it said that , you know , 
but for those students who are determined to do well anyway , that , you know , handling a job was very possible .
i think so too . 
 you know like , what are their plans after high school , you know . 
and what's their home situation . 
 you know that , 
the home is the key . 
i think really is because if the home ,
 and , uh , the main goal is making money now 
and it may be a survival thing 
so , uh , 
but there can still be an attitude of 
 you know , this is a stopgap measure because we need it right now , 
the most important thing is still , you know 
your education . 
it's what's wrong with families .
that's right . 
and if children come to school ,
they don't know what to expect at home . 
they don't feel secure there , 
they don't know what's going to happen just out front of their apartment complex . 
for example that child that was shot . 
 uh , how can they concentrate on schooling ? 
i agree 
i think that's the main problem . 
and schools now are supposed to solve social problems , uh , mental and emotional problems 
and that's overwhelming . 
well uh , you know at our school we have over a thousand elementary kids 
and last year was the first year that we ever had more than one counselor . 
and that's just really not enough . 
it isn't . 
 and i was talking to somebody that teaches in a middle school 
but , you know , part of my feeling is that if you help them to work through their problems while they're littler , then they won't have as many problems up there . 
i think there has to be at least a counselor 
and we just recently had a counselor at elementary . 
we didn't even have counselors in elementary . 
we have always , though , had three at middle schools because we had about a thousand kids 
and they divided them up between three counselors 
but for a good while every year they'd have a different counselor 
and they decided that didn't work . 
so they started , uh , dividing the kids up so that a counselor stays with her group of counselees 
 and i think that would give them more security in going to the counselor . 
if they have a rapport with their counselor . 
now if they don't ,
and occasionally that happens . 
but , it is frightening 
it certainly is . 
and , uh , if we have children who are not getting their education , for one reason or another , then what are we going to do with them ? 
that's right .
what's going to happen to them ? 
are they going to be able to , uh , work at other kind of menial jobs 
or are they going to be the thieves and the people 
and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them . 
that's no good . 
i'm on that , um , campus strategic planning committee for my school . 
and , uh , one of the , uh , you know , oh , 
they have all these different names for things , strategies and all these different things . 
but , anyway , one of the key things was that we believed that the public education is the best economic value . 
then i think they decided to strike economic . 
you know 
you know , well , what kind of a situation do they get there 
and what are , you know , 
and what kind of state are we in if most people are going to private schools . 
well i think , uh , one thing that we'll see is that we won't be educating everybody . 
there will be a lot of people who will not get even a menial education like in other countries of the world 
that's one of the things that we do . 
we try to educate everyone . 
that's right . 
we're the only country in the world that does . 
and let everyone have an opportunity to reach higher education 
they can do that . 
and one of the plano school district's , you know , goals is that they will graduate every child uh , that is here in the ninth grade , 
i believe 
it's worded . 
and , uh , .
 well you know if we can keep them in school . 
then that helps a lot . 
i think the gang violence is scaring everyone to death too . 
oh gosh . 
 well that new movie , 
it's scary to me . 
i , um , 
i guess we're both lucky .
my folks talk about it a lot in illinois . 
my mother was is was teacher for years and years 
and , uh , they live in peoria , illinois , 
and they're talking a lot about you know , the school situation there , too . *[[their should be they're
 so i'll see you when we see you . 
we were in , uh , austin yesterday . 
 the reason that i wasn't at church 
and we went to hear , uh , james wind ensemble concert 
they left this morning for , uh , england . 
oh , how exciting . 
isn't that wonderful ? 
what an experience . 
 and , uh , the university  . . . 
hi , nancy . 
well , do you do a lot of dining out ? 
no , um , 
um , we do it more when we have company come . 
um , what about you ? 
well , we do some dining out . 
um , i do a lot of cooking 
so , um , mostly like when we go out , you know , it's my husband and i , 
we don't go out too often as a family , like a fastfood kind of thing . 
 um , but we do enjoy dining out . 
one of our favorite places here in the dallas area is atlantic cafe . 
i don't know if you , have you ever been there ? 
i've heard of that 
um , where ,
um , well actually there's the atlantic cafe and cafe pacific , and , uh , 
 oh , okay . 
i've been to cafe pacific . 
have you ? 
now that's down in , uh , highland park . 
it's highland park village . 
did you like it ? 
uh  , 
oh , i love it .
before we moved to ,
and we came up one time when my father was visiting 
and , oh , their seafood was wonderful . 
oh , it's fabulous . 
it really is a great place . 
 now where is the atlantic cafe ? 
atlantic cafe is down i believe it's on mckinney . 
oh , okay . 
um , and the guy who owns the atlantic cafe , were partners in the atlantic cafe . 
and then they separated 
and the guy started cafe pacific . 
and , i loved them both . 
i really do . 
i think they're wonderful . 
that's our favorite . 
you know what we'd really like , a casual evening is houston's . 
have you been there ? 
no , um , 
it's wonderful . 
the only thing is you have to wait . 
you have to expect to wait at least an hour . 
so you have to go knowing you're going to be sitting there there for an hour waiting to get in . 
and , as long as you know that  , it's okay . 
but they have , i think , just about the best prime rib 
oh , okay . 
i love it . 
and , my husband really likes their ribs . 
 so it's hysterical . 
we go in 
and we sit there for an hour waiting to get in 
and then we get there 
and we don't even look at the menu .
well , we really enjoy prime rib , too , 
and , uh , actually the steak and ale out here ,
my inlaws also enjoy prime rib , when they've 
 and , uh , the time we went the prime rib was really good . 
was it ? 
 i've been there for like , you know , lunch 
 but , i've never been there for dinner . 
and , it was good , 
oh , that's great . 
another nice place for prime rib is baby doe's 
 oh , i've heard about that , too 
 maxwell's nice , 
have you been there ? 
 but no . 
baby doe's is nice . 
and , one place i'd never been that i would really like to go to , uh , is lawry's . 
i've heard that's real good ,
i had heard that , too . um , 
i've never been there 
have you been to the little , uh , not for prime rib but the cafe de france , um , right here 
uh , they have real nice lunches . 
have you been there for lunch ? 
yes , uh 
primarily lunch , well , and breakfast sometimes 
but , uh , during the week they often have , a limited menu choice but , uh , very reasonable complete dinners for six ninetynine that included 
and , uh , the , 
my husband and i like veal , uh 
and their veal dishes have been good . 
we've tried different ones when they've had them as one of the 
the specials . 
have you ever been to biffin's ? 
i keep hearing about it . 
i keep hearing the advertisements of it 
i have not been over there 
and i was thinking , you know , it's supposed to be a family place over near plano super bowl . 
i haven't either , uh , 
one place , 
and i've only been there for lunch , 
but , uh , i went with a friend , 
and we met her husband , um , down on greenville , 
down near the highway twelve area , is gershwin's , 
i've been there . 
oh , we just we , 
that was nice .
it was 
and we had the , 
and linda had told me they had the best mushroom soup 
and they did . 
it was wonderful 
 uh , and we just had soup and salad so we could make room for the dessert  , 
i don't know if you tried 
i've heard of it . 
where it's made , 
it's like a , 
it's all chocolate , like made like a paper bag 
 and it's filled with what , whip cream 
and it had strawberries , kiwis , and raspberries 
and it was plenty because it was very rich 
but , uh 
it was beautiful .
oh , i bet it was . 
the last time we went to cafe pacific , it was father's day , 
and , uh , .
and so they had , uh , like a berry assortment . 
it was raspberries 
and , you know , they did , like the raspberry puree , just kind of like in a decoration on the , 
you know , how they do the plates real fancy with the decorations and then 
 and it was outstanding . 
it sounds wonderful . 
it was really relatively simple 
but , oh , it was good . 
it was really good . 
well , that's , uh , one of the things that i do enjoy when you get a good restaurant . 
uh , i love fresh berries . 
and , their fruits are always exceptional . 
they must have a special source for getting them because even at the farmer's market , uh , 
you can't find them . 
 you know , i'm originally from connecticut 
and , uh , i was home a few years ago 
and my sister and brotherinlaw were going to take us out for dinner 
and , uh , i was really amazed , you know , 
the restaurants up there were kind of quaint . 
you know , they were real , real pretty 
but they lacked , the service 
and they lacked just the , i don't know . 
the restaurants down here seem like they have , uh , 
i guess there's so much competition that they , really have to be good . 
 i would , too , 
when we do go out , um , in a way it's like a little mini vacation i guess , 
and , uh , it's a whole experience . 
of course you want the food to be good 
but the atmosphere and service i think , are important , uh 
 , i think they have to be good . 
because the ones that aren't so good just don't make it . 
 um , that reminded me of a place for lunch that's a little off the beaten track 
but it is wonderful . 
it's called cafe max 
and it's at plano road and campbell . 
they have the most wonderful salads . 
they do what they call a salad sampler which easily could feed two or three . 
 oh , really ? 
well , my favorite type of music is classical music , 
and , uh , i enjoy orchestral classical music 
and i enjoy classical guitar and classical piano , you know , 
and that's my favorite type . 
uh , probably the favorite instrument would be , uh , the violin . 
oh , well my favorite , well , 
i don't really have a favorite , 
i like everything basically . 
um , i guess if i had to pick , it would be like pop , i would think , 
but i like everything . 
 so , it's kind of hard to choose sometimes . 
yeah , you know . 
i guess a good feel for maybe what's good jazz and what's not , 
 but , um , i enjoy it 
and , uh , sometimes i enjoy listening to , uh , fiddle music . 
we were in colorado recently 
and these , uh , well , we heard this fiddler 
and we bought his tape 
and it's kind of fun to listen to the 
i grew up next door to , uh , the richardson symphony orchestra leader 
oh , chris xeros . 
oh , you lucky thing . 
so , we used to go and listen to them all the time 
and , my parents still do . 
so , i grew up with a lot of his music , and what not . 
plus my parents are , well , 
especially my dad , likes a lot of classical music 
and he introduced my brother and i both , to a lot of it . 
 oh , gosh , 
you grew up with his children , too , then ? 
oh , gosh . 
we all went to high school together 
 uh , and we're still in contact with each other . 
we all go back to parents' houses on the weekends , and what not 
oh gosh . 
well actually , i used to play in the richardson symphony , 
i played violin in the orchestra for several years 
oh really ? 
small world . 
so , uh , i know chris .
he's a pretty nice guy . 
most of the time .
 well i had to work for him 
and i never would want to work for him . 
so  , 
well life just took different turns here 
so , uh , it just didn't work out to do that now . 
so , he's about ready to retire , another year 
and he , 
he sure is , 
he just became a grandfather . 
i heard that . 
it's his daughter that , 
uh , uhhuh . 
they just had the baby's christening 
it was really nice so  , 
he's a little boy .
what did they name him ? 
i can't , 
it's a  , 
it's like elijah , or something like that . 
i keep forgetting , what she named him . 
his middle name is chris , or christopher for 
of course . 
it starts with an e . 
i can't remember .
oh , so you've heard the richardson symphony ? 
we've heard them and , liked it real well , of course .
do you have a favorite instrument ? 
um , actually one of my favorite instruments is a harpsichord . 
i really like those , 
in fact , i had a harpsichord played at my wedding . 
oh , did you ? 
which was real nice . 
i got married , uh , during the christmas season 
and we played , uh , old fashioned christmas carols instead of normal wedding marches and what not , 
and it was real nice , 
i liked that a lot . 
i liked the sound of the harpsichord . 
and it played by itself ? 
well , i mean , but you didn't have oboe or something with it ? 
well , i bet that was nice . 
it went well , 
it was a change , you know , from your traditional , normal , you know , stuff , and , uh , we had the church decorated with christmas hollies and poinsettias and , you know , stuff like that 
not , you know , the bouncy , you know 
some , i don't even , i recognize the melodies , and whatnot , 
but i didn't recognize the name . 
well actually , in a string quartet that often plays at weddings . 
so , um , i always think it's a nice break from the traditional organ or piano . 
and , it makes it nice . 
it makes , you know , you can say classy 
or it makes an elegant wedding to have 
it does . 
it really does 
and it has such a different sound to it , anyway . 
it's almost , 
i don't know the way it vibrates , 
it's kind of haunting , you know , on some of the notes .
i like it . 
i don't know how else to explain . 
but , we've got friends that are in the music business that go around dallas , 
they're , uh , called odessa . 
it's a husband and wife team that we've known for years 
and , uh , we try to make contact with them periodically to see what's going on and stuff , too , 
so we've had a lot of stuff , you know , friends and things to do with music that constant , 
plus my husband's real big into music , too , 
so . he doesn't play anything , 
and my dad and 
my kids are now well , 
my oldest is getting to the point where he likes certain types of music and favorite songs and when they come on we have to turn the radio up full blast 
oh . now in your city , 
does it offer , like band , or some of the instruments ? 
so he hasn't really gotten into , um , that yet . 
they have choir that they go to , you know , music 
but , um , he's not old enough yet to get into the band yet . 
i think that starts in sixth grade . 
probably . oh . 
but i don't know . 
 the only thing he's shown interest in wanting to play is the drums 
cause my brother plays , 
and , um , i don't know if he's really serious about it yet or not  , you know , 
it's just one of those things i'm just going to wait and see if he's interested 
you got a little ways to go , too .
 right  .
just a little bit .
well , well my oldest is eight 
we've , started her on piano 
so , uh , 
but , it's been fun , 
i mean it's a lot of work to see that she's prepared 
i feel like i've learned a lot about the piano . 
i've learned a lot about playing the piano . 
and , uh , it kind of makes me listen a little closer see and hear someone playing . 
i sort of watch their technique , too , and see if it corresponds up to what she's learning . 
i don't know if any of mine will be interested in it 
or  . . . 
it's best done when you have leisure time 
and i had more of that in my childhood days than i have now .
and i grew up in an area that , uh , was just a few feet from a rather large lake , and a few more miles from that was a even larger lake 
and we had . h , 
i worked for a camp for a number of years . 
my father was on staff there , 
and we had every kind of things from canoes to paddle boats , sailboats , speedboats , 
you name it , they had it 
and we did a lot of  , water sports . 
but i think , uh , 
couple of guys , uh , restored an old wooden boat that was built back in the midthirties and got a new canvas sail for it and had a real big old four foot center board that went down in the middle to keep you upright when the waves , 
or the wind came from the side 
and we got that thing in the water and had a real good time with it . 
if you ever got it dumped over , though , it was a mess to get back up . 
it wasn't like the newer ones that have nice chambers that keep it afloat or keep it , uh , upright again . 
this one you had to work with . 
you get out of the water again and get it upright . 
and , uh , sailing the wind , as it were , tacking back and forth 
and , uh , more than once we'd get out there on a really stormy day 
and , uh , the storm or the wind was due to the front blowing 
and you paddle your way back in and hope it doesn't start raining on you right away . 
and that didn't always work . 
we oftentimes got wet , .
but , uh , nice hobby to have . 
nowadays i don't think i could afford the boat or the time , nor do we live that close to a lake anymore , 
so things change , i guess . 
what are your memories of boating , 
or current , 
uh , about the only memories that i have of boating , uh , 
my husband's family had a motor boat , uh , when we got engaged 
and they took us out on the lake several times . 
and , uh , i really did enjoy that . 
i don't know that i ever learned to drive it or anything , 
but , uh , we did some water skiing , of course , and just the basic safety rules and things i found real interesting . uh , you know , 
they just didn't patrol you like they did with the automobile or whatever . 
the laws were there 
and if you didn't obey them , uh 
that's true . 
but , uh , i found the motor boating was real fun . 
i remember learning how to ski , oh , 
i guess i was seven or eight years old 
and the lake that we learned on was the smaller of the two that we had access to 
and it was maybe fifteen , twenty acres 
and uh  , it had a lot of , uh , turtles in it . 
and i got all ready to go 
and i was down in the water and set to go 
 uh , and just as that boat took off , a turtle bit me in the middle of the back . 
it didn't hurt too much , 
but it bit enough to where i let go . 
and the boat went off without me 
and i reached back there and a while 
 and , uh , it didn't even leave a mark . 
it was just a little nibble 
and so i told everybody what happened 
and so i get back down in there 
 and i'll be if he didn't do it again . 
this time a little earlier and swatted him away . 
so i moved over a few feet in the water and got out of his little realm where he was living underneath the dock and , uh , managed to get up . 
didn't go very far , 
but i got up . 
and uh , nice long skiing career , 
but now i've gotten to where skiing is just kind of wears me out more than it does thrill me . 
i've , uh , done about all i dare do on skis . you know , skiing on one and jumping around here and there 
and i know how you can get injured doing much more than that 
and i just can't risk it right now being a head of the family and the breadwinner and all that . 
just , uh , can't take the risk i did as a dumb teenager , i guess .
so life just changes a little bit in that respect .
i'd kind of like , someday , to maybe end up on a pair of skis that doesn't have a , uh , well , 
what they call trick skis . 
they'll allow you to ski backwards . 
i haven't managed to get a hold on that , uh , craft yet , 
but , uh , 
that sounds like a real challenge . 
it would be kind of nice . 
i hadn't quite figured out , 
i don't have anybody to teach me either . 
that's another little thing . 
you need somebody to kind of tell you what to do , 
but , just from what i've seen , you just kind of work your way up to it and turn around real quick  , you know . grab the rope behind you and then just let go real quick and let it whip you around . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
maybe someday after the kids are up and grown and the monies are there to get away for times on end , weekend or something . 
well , my son , 
where is your favorite place to go ? 
well , we haven't traveled outside the united states that much . 
uh , we usually take family type vacations . 
we're looking forward to one in october to disneyworld in florida . 
oh , that's great . 
we have a nine year old . 
have you ever been there ? 
and this time we're going to be going with just one daughter 
and she's nine , 
so it ought to just be a ball . 
oh , that's a perfect age 
i think so , too . 
oh , that's great . 
so we've been there a number of times 
and , uh , we're going next year . 
we have a business trip every fall . 
well , we go on a lot of business trips . 
oh , wonderful . 
so you travel a lot . 
well , we do . 
we g , 
my husband travels a couple times a month 
and in the position he's in , they don't care if i go along . 
so it's great . 
i just kind of join up when it's something interesting 
 and it will be at this time of the year 
and this year uh , uh , matter of fact we're leaving next saturday for new orleans . 
oh , that will be fun , too . 
have you ever been there ? 
we haven't been lately 
and i know they've changed it a lot and upgraded everything , 
but we used to have a lot of fun there . 
well , you know , we went there once . 
in fact , we had been in dallas 
and we were on our way home 
and we were driving 
he's going to be , 
i hope it's swimming season 
 because it wasn't a tremendous amount of things to do . 
if you don't like the night life and the antique shopping , there isn't much there , 
but , that can be fun . 
well , and that's probably , 
we do like the night life , to an extent 
and they do have a mardi gras night planned . 
and i'm kind of anxious for that , 
but , uh , yours to disneyworld sounds a little bit better . 
did you know that next week there's several t v shows coming from there in celebration of their anniversary . 
well , and with a daughter , nine , it is just , 
she's old enough to really grasp 
be excited about all of it . 
uh , so , well , if you're working , then you're probably on a limited amount of time per year that you can go . 
well , not really , 
we're doing the same thing . tying it in with my husband's business trip 
and i just save vacation for things like that .
oh , that's , 
well , i really , i think travel  , 
how easy .
and really at our point of life our children are grown 
and , uh , it has just worked out really well with this , uh , position he's in .
and it depends where he's going whether or not i decide to go along 
 but i do like to travel 
and it's , uh , 
i don't mind the pool life at all 
and i like to sight see 
and i love to shop . 
so it's  , 
so that's perfect . 
what more could you ask for ? 
that's right , 
but it , 
and then got to pick and choose the places . 
well , and one of my very favorite is las vegas . 
uh , that 
i would have to say we both end up going to las vegas , uh , probably once every maybe year and a half . 
and presently we have quite a few frequent flyer miles 
 and so i've just requested that they send us two of our coach tickets 
because we have a lot of flying with continental 
 and they're recommending that you use those because they don't know the future of continental . 
it's kind of shaky . 
we better start using them . 
that's true . 
it really is . 
so we are thinking that we might go to las vegas during the winter this year sometime for just kind of a quick trip . 
uh , when we normally go that way , we like to go to california at the same time , because we really don't get out there as often as you could probably 
our last big trip , we drove through new mexico and colorado and went to the grand canyon and , uh , back through silverton and durango 
and , oh , it was fun . 
it was so relaxing and a really neat part of the country 
and the kids were old enough to really enjoy it . 
i think that's a good trip . 
and really , for the children to learn as well for a family vacation that would be excellent . 
now we did , what we sometimes do since we are in ohio 
and it takes a while just to even get to what i would call the more picturesque part of the country , 
we will fly to something like , 
once we flew to colorado to denver 
and then we rented a car for two weeks 
and we went through the northern route and through utah 
and then we returned through , uh , new mexico that you just mentioned . 
and it was 
oh , there's 
oh , that's the way to , 
uh , i work at t i 
and we have , uh , of course , started uh , random drug testing here 
and , uh , i haven't gotten called yet , 
but , uh , i feel that if they feel like there is a vast majority of the people at the company doing drugs . 
do they feel that way ? 
uh , i think that they thought that there was a lot of drug usage here at t i , 
but i think our latest statistic said something like ninetynine point nine eight percent were , uh , testing negative on all the dru , 
 well , i think it's a good idea just because i'm opposed to 
i think it can cause a lot of problems even though they think they can handle it . 
it's , uh , 
i don't know , 
i don't really liken it to alcohol 
but , yet that can be carried to an extreme , too . 
so i think it's a good idea 
and i think just the idea you know that you may be tested 
i don't know that their job would be at risk , 
because i think they may put them into some sort of a program to get them off of drugs . 
i would think that , 
is that how they do it at t i maybe . 
at t i , if you get called in and you test positive for drugs , then you're put on a program 
and , uh , you know , you go through the program 
and then you're called like six months after you complete the program 
 and if you test positive , then you're terminated . 
well ,  , 
but , you know , of that type of thing .
 and you expect them to do their job 
that's right . 
oh , and , of course they can also cause injury to other people . 
if they're not , uh , you know , fully functional mentally while they're doing their job . they could cause 
 they could just go off the deep end 
and it would be , uh , you know , out of the question . 
also , i guess you can , you know , get the wrong kind of stuff and kill yourself 
that's right . 
oh yeah . 
i sub in the schools 
 so i've , you know , had a , 
and i think it's good that they're trying to start some programs down in the elementary schools . 
but , you know , i think they can test all they want for drugs you know , 
and i know many of them are doing it . 
i know my son has had to do it for both sam's and walmart 
 and i don't know how many others are doing that 
and i think that's good 
 oh , yes . 
that's right . 
and , uh ,  , i don't know , 
it's just a problem that no one is sure just how to handle 
you know , i think personally i'm for it . 
there's several reason why i could think of right now why we shouldn't have it such as drug testing , 
they say , runs approximately a thousand dollars a person every time you do it . 
it's that high ? 
and , oh , yeah , 
and , uh , 
i didn't realize 
it's not like a normal urinalysis 
and , uh , i didn't get a raise this year , 
because , nobody in our company got a raise . 
but , yet 
just lucky to have jobs . 
and if they weren't spending all the money on drug testing , people could have got a raise . 
 so , see , you know , there's different , 
i think that's more of a personal view of mine 
and i know that . 
but then , i have other views to it . 
i didn't think it was that expensive because my son was in probably a week and a half period 
 and sam's and walmart are owned by the same people 
he took one for , uh , walmart 
and then sam's called him 
and he took another one 
 and you know , i don't know why they both made him do that 
i can see if  , 
because , you know , if it's a thousand dollars , that's a thousand dollars they wasted . 
theirs might not run a thousand dollars . *[[their's theirs
from what i understanding here at t i , they run close to a thousand dollars an employee . 
well , maybe they run , 
i don't know , you know , 
that's just guessing it . 
maybe they run a lot of other tests , 
or maybe it's under a health 
i just can't imagine 
for all the pub , 
oh , it's , 
so have you done any painting projects lately ? 
oh , really ? 
was not a big deal 
what kind of 
two little deals , 
the first one , um , 
i helped someone repaint an apartment , 
and it was very easy . 
was it ? 
i always thought it would be , 
so , you know , you'd have to hire someone if you needed to paint inside your house or something 
 but i know i can do it . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and the second one was i bought some toys um , at a craft fair . 
they're unfinished wooden book ends and stuff for a little girl for christmas , 
and so i decided to paint them , 
and that wasn't as easy as painting the apartment .
 oh , well , what kind of paint did you use for the , um , bookends ? 
well , it was a oil base , 
so i had to get , 
and when i painted them , i didn't realize that we didn't have any turpentine or paint thinner or anything in the house . 
so i had it all over my hands . 
at first i didn't realize , you know , 
i had never painted anything , 
so i didn't realize 
i mean , i kind of knew , in the back of my mind , 
so you can't use oil on wood ? 
well , no , 
and i went to wash the brushes out , and , uh , wash my hands , 
and you can't wash it off with water . 
you have to get uh , a solution 
oh , so you had to go around with paint all over you ,
i had to drive to the store 
i had to drive to the store with paper towels all over my hands to go buy 
and then , um , downstairs in the apartment , we just used a latex base , 
and so you can drip it on , you know 
if you dripped it on something , as long as you wiped it up , it was real easy to clean . 
oh , is that what you usually use in the house , is latex ? 
the same with the toys , 
it's just important to look for one that doesn't have lead in it , you know , 
i heard about that . 
i guess a friend of mine had a , uh , well , 
 she just started up a day care center , 
and uh , one of the real strict , uh , restrictions , was the fact that she had to have a special kind of paint that was fire proof and lead free and all that other good stuff 
 so , uh , she had that done . 
but , uh , 
have you painted anything recently . 
wow , was it huge ? 
 and , um , what i had to do is just coat this bare wood with a sealer , 
and , uh , i had this big five gallon jug , 
and it was like paint thinner . 
i mean you know , it looked just like , it was the viscosity of paint thinner 
 but , uh , you just took a roller and put it on there , 
and , uh , if you saw that the wood was getting wet , you know , that was all you needed . 
it was , 
it used all of it . 
i guess it was about three hundred yards worth . 
so . well , i guess it worked out . 
it was pretty easy , actually . 
i think though , um , we're lucky that we didn't have to do any detail work , because i don't know if i could , you know , 
i don't know , 
i don't know , 
must be difficult , 
well what about the trim in your house ? 
did you have to do that ? 
i just , like , what , 
we had a couple of different size brushes 
i went around the trim , 
and if it , 
and there was wall paper , 
like i was around the doors and windows 
it came right off 
oh , yeah , 
 so there was no major mistakes , 
there was , 
uh , two , actually 
 um , and it , 
there was , um , 
you know , around the windows , if you got it on the glass , we let it dry and scraped it after that 
but that , 
that would be really uh , a time saver . 
well , yeah , 
if you just , you know 
we didn't tape anything , 
we weren't that careful , 
but it wasn't , you know , 
i don't know , it's funny , 
it's like , if you just go slow , or at least i didn't get that many mistakes 
i didn't make that many mistakes , 
oh , me , i would have had to have taped the whole thing , and then brushed around the edges , 
 and then i'd have probably rolled it on . 
it would have taken me forever . 
just because you'd be afraid to do it , or have you done it before . 
well , the first time it'd probably would have taken me forever , 
 well , it wasn't , 
if it was my own i would have , 
well , how long did it take you all ? 
well , a couple of week ends 
we would go down 
so there was two of you all ? 
and i was just painting because i don't know how to do anything else .
 well , that's easy enough . 
so , there's a whole bunch of people . 
so now i feel like if i ever buy a house , i can probably paint , if nothing else . 
i think i could probably do it 
but you know , i went in to a hardware store to get paint for those toys , 
but i didn't realize what , you know , pain it is to clean the brushes and everything , if you don't have latex 
i don't if 
it's worth the shine , 
uh , i don't know , 
do you ? 
i don't . 
i'm pretty opinionated about that and many other things as you well know . 
i agree with it . 
any employee any time they see fit . 
i just don't think there's a place in our environment , you know in the work force for drugs , or alcohol either . 
well , i don't believe in drugs or alcohol , 
but if you'll remember when the teachers had to take the t cat 
 and we were laughing that we'd have to go to that examination to prove we could read and write with a specimen of urine 
 and we found it belittling . 
you did ? 
uhhuh . well , i can sort of understand that , uh , 
but not being a teacher , as you are , you know , if kay were a teacher or something . 
that's true . 
but , uh , 
but then , you know , at the same token , i'm not against 
because i look at airline pilots 
that's right . 
that's right . 
it's supposed to be a huge problem with truck drivers using drugs 
uh , that's right 
 and i think it is a big problem with them using drugs 
but , uh , 
you know , in those areas i really , you know , do believe that maybe we should clean up our , you know 
i think so 
i agree with it . 
uh , i know kay's company , you know , 
they started it couple of years ago , 
and so many of the people , even the professional people boy , they were so against them doing that , you know , 
uh , you either need a job or you don't . 
the job is what provides all of your needs , 
and i think most of them have agreed to that now , although they didn't like it at first . 
i think it's just like anything else , a new concept , you know , 
as i said , if i have to go to a testing area with my urine specimen i was insulted , 
it is , 
i can see where you would think , 
but at the same token , in education we can't do random drug testing on kids 
that's true , 
 you know , i mean , their rights are protected . 
you bet . 
oh , gosh , they would really raise a stink if that was to 
 well , but if you're going to do teachers or professionals , why not do the kids ,
i agree with that . 
i wouldn't be opposed to it at all , 
it's just our bleeding heart liberals that would fight it tooth and nail , you know 
that's true . 
 but , uh , well , lynn , i've enjoyed talking with you . 
 well , listen , 
yeah , you know 
if you agree that , uh , 
i believe that truck drivers and people that have , 
even though teachers have other kids lives in their hands , if they come in stoned or they come in drunk 
 and there was an incident in my children's high school , where a teacher stayed drunk , 
is that right ? 
you just don't think of that happening with teachers 
and he , 
i really don't , 
when i think of drug testing , i'm thinking of the , you know , outside of education . 
uh , well , no , 
you know , we are as susceptible a society 
i know that , 
but , uh 
 and , uh 
well , did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation . 
isn't that , 
it was on the news tonight . 
it's mind bog , you know , well , you know , 
i agree with you , 
i know teachers are just like everybody else , same problems 
then , i think , you know , push came to shove , i'd probably be drug tested 
because it does , you know , 
you think the benefit would be greater than the , 
and yet , i know of , you know , one teacher who was an alcoholic 
and that was in your children's high school , 
isn't that amazing , 
and , you know , my children brought it to my attention . 
i never 
if it's 
 you know , because they represent a pretty good , 
and that's not giving a good example to students . 
certainly not , 
they don't need that example 
i'm a putterer . 
i , well , 
i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn 
this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall bulbs . 
we've had a late fall 
it seems like , the weather , 
in fact today it's really warm , 
and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up , 
but you know you need to pretty soon . 
well , that's the way this was . 
the petunias were really great . 
our mums are beautiful , 
uh , i don't think we've had a frost up here . 
i was down in   for a week , 
so i don't know what happened last week 
 uh , but , uh , i don't know if it's late . 
i'm sort of waiting for indian summer 
so i can get a lot of stuff down out here . 
uh , i enjoy it . 
this year . 
we came from nine years in a condo , uh , 
and working in that condo , you didn't have to do anything 
so now 
you know , i can't , 
this is my third house i think , i've owned , um , 
but , uh , it's interesting , you know , 
the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling , 
and it sort of gets away from me 
i enjoy most of it , 
and about this time of year it starts getting a little old , 
and i start looking forward to , you know , having other things to do with my 
the grass 
well , it is for me 
because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing . 
we had a terrible summer , 
we had a drought 
 and , uh , took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing , 
and now it's really growing 
and i'm trying to establish a good root growth 
ours seems to have slowed down here . 
we're not having to mow every week religiously 
 but we're still fighting bugs , and ready to change some of the summer flowers out 
i still have caladiums that are pretty , which is a surprise this late in the year . 
oh , really ? 
but like today , it's eightyfive degrees 
oh , yeah 
it's really strange , 
i hear that from , my brotherinlaw lives in plano , 
but that'll change 
well , he always 
we'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already . 
 he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here 
and then he calls us , 
oh , my gosh . 
it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine . 
well , texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants , because our summers are so terribly hot 
 and we have ice storms every year . 
and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those 
some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings . 
that is , 
 you know , i was like conditioned to it 
 they have to be hardened to it 
that's strange with me . 
you know , you think , dallas , you know , almost semitropical , you wouldn't have that kind of problem , 
well , for the most part we don't , 
but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold . 
well , the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter 
 but the plants that we have around . 
we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to 
oh do they . 
that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time 
i love , 
i love uh , the landscaping , 
like i say , my brotherinlaw   .  get to carrollton quite a bit . 
i go there on business , 
and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens , 
and texas is , 
dallas is very nice . 
i really enjoy it there . the landscaping , the homes , the architecture , the whole thing 
and my wife and i , 
except for the lack of trees , out where we are .
and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful , we really miss it . 
that we have , you know 
ohio's a very pretty state . 
in seventysix we moved to chicago , 
we lived there for five years , 
and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt , 
uh , we were coming in 
and before the plane landed she looked out the window 
  this is illinois , 
you're not . 
and , when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house , there were no trees 
 and now all of a sudden it was being developed , 
and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees , 
do you have any children ? 
i work in a daycare center 
and   .
oh , well , you know all about it then . 
i enjoy it a lot . 
it's been quite a few years . 
i have grandchildren but , uh , haven't really been into selecting child care for them , 
and it's been quite a few years since i've had to think about that . 
do they go to a daycare center 
or do they stay at , 
uh , my daughter that has three stays home 
oh , that's nice . 
and one of my daughters has one 
but an aunt keeps the baby . 
oh , that's nice . 
but i would not really know how to go about selecting one nowadays , 
but i would imagine it's very hard . 
i think so . 
i think it's hard to find a good day care . 
i have worked at some other ones that were not very good 
but this one that i'm in now is very good . 
and one of the key things is how many adults are there in ratio to the children . 
and like in pennsylvania for babies , that's what i work with , there has to be a one to four ratio at the most .
but we keep it down to like two to one . 
oh , well , that's good . 
that makes it a little easier to deal with . 
i've always thought , you know , it would be really tough . 
what if you had a fire or something with babies ? 
oh , i know . 
you would have to be able to have enough , 
you know , you'd have to be able to get them all out . 
what we do is we have these cribs in the back room 
and they're reenforced real strong 
and they'll sit four babies . 
we would just lie them in there 
and they roll real well and maneuver . 
oh , well , that's a , 
that will get them out . 
i hadn't thought about that . 
but you could put them in one of these cribs and then roll the crib out i guess . 
 well , that's neat . 
that's certainly something we hope never happens . 
well , do most of your daycare workers really care about the children , 
or is it just a job for them ? 
most really care , in this center , really care . 
uh , most everyone has a college degree in like early childhood education . 
and really there's only like eight children per room 
and then there's like two or mostly three care givers in each room . 
and that enables them to spend more time with the children . 
sometimes i feel like all i'm doing is changing diapers , giving bottles , and putting babies down for a nap . 
so , it's nice to be able to play with them and really get to know them . 
it's easy to get attached to them too . 
how old are the children go with this center where you work ? 
um , in my room they go from eight weeks to nine months . 
and throughout the center it goes up to like age twelve . 
so , i have the real young ones in my room . 
you've got the little bitty ones . 
those are the , probably the best group to have . 
you know , they're wonderful . 
they don't complain too much .
and they're fun . 
they are a lot of fun . 
babies are fun , 
and they're not quite big enough to be getting into everything yet , 
not quite . 
it's a , 
when they start to crawl they try to climb up on things 
you have to be real careful everything is baby proof . 
you know , all the doors have latches and stuff so they can't get into anything 
but they try . 
do you 
but , yeah , 
in my area 
because i live in a college town in penn state university 
 so i , 
there is a lot of college educated people and stuff that are in the centers that really seem to have an idea of what's going on . 
and , uh , in general though i've been really disappointed with a lot 
it's not my choice for when i have children 
 but some people don't have a choice . 
sometimes it's a have to . 
i hear a lot of the girls i work with , uh , constantly , oh , 
i wish i could find someplace i really felt good about . you know ? 
most of them don't really feel that it's a great place to leave their kids . 
that is sad . 
and it's really bad , you know . 
one of the girls she was leaving hers at where she felt like was a really good place , 
lacy fell asleep on the bus after our field trip today , 
and we just now found her . 
they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon . 
oh , my god . 
if they'll take a group of kids to the zoo or somewhere and then come back and not even count them and realize they're one short . 
but one of the teachers happened to walk by and see her pounding on the window trying to get out of the bus . 
oh , my god . 
and this was four hours later , you know . 
 oh , that poor child . 
uh , so , you know , i , 
what do you do ? 
that's awful . 
so she has switched to a different center now 
and , uh , 
 well , i , 
well , just to let you know , i have , uh , two , uh , children of my own . 
i've got two boys , uh , one four year old and one two years old , 
so i'm just starting out . 
oh , yes .
i have two boys who are twentyeight and twentyfour 
that's quite a spread .
same husband , everything . 
that's great . 
uh  , but , 
well , i guess , uh , in one of the things uh , when i get home is , i like to try and spend a lot of time with them . 
you know , they're not very old , 
 so they couldn't do a whole lot , yet . 
but they like to , uh , spend time with me . 
we just , oh , just do various things , nothing really . 
they like to be outside as much as possible . 
if it's not raining . 
right , uh , 
but , you know , the weather's trying to turn now 
are you down here in texas ? 
okay , uh  , 
what , w , well , 
or play video games or something . 
 , i have , 
can you hold on just a sec , 
that's okay . 
good morning , a r e , this is arlene lister .
i'm sorry , 
keep going . 
it's okay . 
uh , so that was the thing that they have a tendency to do the same thing . 
and one of the things we try to do is we try to avoid doing that as much as possible .
and , uh , seeing as you've got 
 well , there was not nearly as much of it . 
in fact , were quite a bit different . 
uh , when all the mothers were home . 
you know , the kids got up in the morning and ate breakfast and poked around 
and then when they felt like it , they went out to play , you know 
and , uh , i think it's gotten , uh , very different . 
when my second one was little , they were coming out with sesame street 
and , other than that , i mean , there was not educational t v 
and that was it , 
but they were never that interested in it anyway . 
i mean , they'd take their trucks out in the backyard  , you know 
but , we always did , uh , oh , just , you know , to the park for walks 
we did a lot of stuff like that 
and , course , when they got bigger , uh , they were both quite into sports 
 and , uh , .
we have  , 
a girl would like you to spend time with her going shopping .
so , they're very different , 
but , uh , y , 
kind of the same thing , our , you know , 
she now , 
lot of time spent with her , 
she's so busy 
is , uh 
like last night was a band concert 
 and she plays on her school volleyball team and , uh , stuff like that . 
but , uh , we still , uh , oh , like to pack up , you know , just go someplace for the day 
one of our older kids now is going to graduate school down at college station 
oh , that's nice . 
 so that's , uh , 
we go down there fairly often , you know , for a weekend for , you know , family gettogethers and stuff like that . 
that's great . 
that's great . 
i know i'd like to get into do more camping and outings and things . 
and i think we probably will soon as the boys get a little 
but , uh , you know , for right now , they don't , you know , 
just getting out in the front , and just being outside is good for them 
because they like 
oh , yes . 
i think , our kids just always dearly loved that , you know , play bounce the ball , or 
course , when our big ones were little , we lived up north , you know 
 and this time of the year the fun thing was to go out and swoosh around in the leaves  , you know . 
that's true , 
you don't see many leaves around dallas . 
come winter time we'd stick them on sleds . 
and from little on , you know , 
you go take lessons to learn to ice skate or something . 
you know , when our kids were little you got them a pair of skates .
well what kind of car , uh , are you thinking of buying next ? 
uh , more than likely , it's going to be a chrysler . 
it won't be a ford . 
i've got a ford mustang now , 
and i hate it . 
do you really ? 
what year is it ? 
it's a eightyeight . 
and why don't you like the mustang ? 
it's , um , 
i've had one problem with it after the other . 
i'll be darned . 
the paints peeling off of it , 
there you go . 
 well , uh . 
that , uh , 
i , uh , 
my electrical system shorted out like two or three times , 
and it's been torn up since april , 
 and luckily , everything was under warranty , 
so it's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed . 
it would have been like two thousand .
well , uh , we've always had oldsmobiles , and , uh , been very , uh , happy with oldsmobiles , 
but , uh , my wife thought she wanted to get a ford mustang 
and then she kind of changed her mind and thinks her next car ought to be one of those , uh , mitsubishi eclipses . 
she real , 
those are nice cars . 
she has a sister that lives in , uh , phoenix that has one and , uh , really , uh , enjoys it . 
well , uh , what things do you consider when you buy a car ? 
um , the gas mileage for one thing , 
and i've always had like stick shift . 
the next car i get i want it to be automatic . 
i see . 
i hate driving anyway , 
 and changing gears at stop lights and stuff is really getting on my nerves now . 
especially when you're in high traffic areas 
and , you know , when you work nine to five , or eight to five , and you're in rush hour traffic to and from work , unfortunately . 
that makes it very frustrating . 
and i look , 
and one of the things with chrysler right now the warranties that they have , 
and i feel like their , 
everybody i've talked to that owns one , has been real pleased with it , 
and i like the driver's air bag , 
i like that . 
now this is a lebaron ? 
uh , yeah , 
but lebaron would be the next car i get , 
i sure like those rag top lebarons , 
they really look sporty . 
i like that too , huh , 
but , uh , i couldn't afford the insurance on one of those .
 well , uh , we always , 
this last oldsmobile we bought , uh , it's an eightyseven , 
but we bought it in eightyeight , you know , right at the end of the year when they were trying to get rid of them 
 and , uh , uh , we found a real good interest rate , 
you know , when they're trying to get rid of those cars at the end of the year like that , they really come down on their prices 
and , uh , uh , you know , we looked around at used cars , 
and we really couldn't , uh , afford the payments on a used car , 
because , uh , if you go to the bank and try to get a loan , they want to charge twelve , thirteen percent , you know , 
and we ended up , i think , with like a four and a half percent interest rate on a brand new car , and the payments . 
well , that's what i'm paying on mine now . 
i had to get like a first time , 
my dad's always cosigned my loans , or whatever , 
and this is one , when i bought , 
i got my mustang this time by myself , because i got on my own , or whatever , 
and , um , i had said , 
they said it had to be like a first time buyer's car or whatever , 
and they're charging me unreasonable   interest , 
but i've got eight more payments 
and it's paid for . 
well , that's great . 
but i got it when the eightyeights first came out , 
it's a good car , i mean , i got in eightyseven , i guess , in like november or something like that , 
well , when our kids were younger we really wanted a two door . 
our first car was an oldsmobile back in seventyseven . 
it was a two door cutlass supreme , 
and , uh , it just happened that when we looked for our new car , they had a thing going with oldsmobile 
and if you'd buy a new oldsmobile they'd give you four hundred rebate , because it was their seventyfifth anniversary . 
i belie , 
so in addition to everything else we got off the car , all we had to do is show them our , uh , papers on our first car , 
and they gave us another four hundred dollars off on it . 
so we got a four door this time , 
and i sort of went more for uh , the comfort factor , 
and , uh , i liked the smaller cars , 
but i'm a bigger person , 
and i really like comfort , you know , driving along the road and stuff . 
well , that's another big factor of mine . 
next car i get's going to be a four door too . something with some room . 
because is two door with bucket seats , 
and you buy groceries and stuff like that . 
and if you try to take anybody , you know , go to the show or go out for supper , and you go as a foursome , 
what do you feel are some of the main problems ? 
well , i'm in an urban area . 
i'm in dallas . 
and we're finding that crime is going up very quickly and has become a major problem , uh , even a more major problem . 
uh , in dallas , some of the major problems , uh , 
drugs seems to be related to quite a bit of the crime we have now . 
there is a lot of theft , a lot of assault dealing with , uh , people trying to get money for drugs . 
and , uh , i think that's a national problem , though . 
it's not unique , 
we've had a lot of murders drug related and stuff .
durham , raleigh , and chapel hill is the triangle . 
research triangle 
and , uh , i'm sure you have a lot of students there , uh , and a lot of researchers 
so you know , perhaps a little better economic climate , 
but , in all your cities now , it seems like a crowd that's really effected by this bill . 
really , it's , 
and i've seen in more in durham than i have in raleigh or 
chapel hill is kind of a ritzy city or whatever . 
i mean , it's kind of , 
i'm sure there is problems with it , 
but it has a pretty low crime rate . to , durham has probably got the worst . 
they've had like fortyeight murders since the beginning of the year . 
and over half of it has been drug related . 
um . well , here , uh , i'm not sure how many dallas has had . 
i've , uh , 
houston is averaging about two a week or three or four , 
i don't know . 
a number every week . 
uh , dallas is having quite a few . 
seems like most of ours are occurring in late at night or , like i say , drug related . 
uh , i guess the other thing was that are causing a lot of the crime now is the decrease in values . 
seems like a lot of people don't hold human life quite as high as perhaps they used to . 
uh , i , 
well , that , 
 and the economy is so bad 
the economy is lousy .
they've done special stories on the news , local news here . 
we had a lot of bank robberies and lot of break ins and stuff . 
i know , like a week or so ago , 
i live in a town house , which is , you know , 
it's a pretty nice neighborhood 
and this lady was going to work , 
she came home and everything in her house was total gone , light fixtures , everything . 
and nobody thought any different , 
they just thought she was moving . 
it was a moving man pulled right up to her house , broke in and stole everything she owned .
boy that really takes someone who is bold to do that . 
well , yeah , 
it's pretty bad .
well , now , do you find that security is very good in a town home ? 
 and we all know one another 
 and , on our one little section of the street we all know one another and know that we're not moving and different things like that . 
well , that , 
one of the youngest people that live over here . 
i see . 
most people are , retired 
or whatever . 
 and i'm in my twenties , 
so i'm out more than they are , 
so i really don't worry about anything . 
well , i think you hit on one point there is you know each other . 
i'm in a neighborhood where we try to keep up with everything . 
uh , i am , oh , about three blocks off a major road and , uh , a couple of blocks off another road that kind of runs , 
i guess you would say the neighborhood road , it runs between the high school and the commercial districts 
and , uh , i'm over the northeast part of dallas . 
it's in a nice neighborhood . 
the houses here , uh , before the recession were running two hundred thousand or so 
and , course , everything's down ten to twenty percent now . 
see , that's the same thing here . 
but we have , uh , 
one thing that effects us is we have apartments that are probably about a half mile away 
and now the economy is bad , 
they have trouble keeping those full 
 so they've dropped the , uh , 
they're not nearly as selective as they used to be . 
and , course , that's kind of like a cancer in an apartment complex . 
you start letting that happen and they go down 
and then before you know it you have drugs and a lot of other things 
 so , uh , i'm sure that aggravates it also . 
but , unemployment now in dallas , or in texas is up around six point , 
what do you do , now ? 
well , we have saved our newspapers for years and years 
 uh , so we've done that for quite some time , 
but since the price of paper has gone down 
like it's about a fifth of what it used to be 
oh , really ? 
 so the boy scout troop quit doing it when the city took it over . 
so now we just put ours out for the city of plano . 
do you live in plano ? 
and i'm so glad when they brought out those recycling bins . 
have you had yours now ? 
although just about a week ago some of my volunteer mothers that , uh , work in the library for me said they hadn't gotten theirs . 
oh , that's why i asked you . 
and not everyone got theirs right away . 
and you know , recycling the aluminum and 
we used 
and , uh 
my garage was just getting overwhelmed . 
i know . 
and , of course , i didn't go weekly , 
 so it became quite a big 
and , uh , 
i'm really glad they do it . 
uh , yeah , 
i do news , mostly newspapers and , uh , plastic two liter diet coke bottles .
but i don't use as many of those . 
i guess the ones that are hard to convince yourself to do are the ones that are really dirty that you have to wash out .
well , i found out after washing out many a peanut butter jar that they're not a recycling number one or two . 
uh , ha . 
uh , ha , 
wasting all your time and effort and ,
thinking i was safe in buying those jars as far as the environment was concerned . 
but , uh , you know , but it's not that hard now that i've got this 
got your routine down . 
well , i guess there are some places , uh , in the north , in particular that , uh , have a real definite way of encouraging you to recycle 
because let's see , they charge you for your garbage pick up by the weight . 
uh , uhhuh . 
so if you recycle things , of course , then you don't have all that weight in there . 
i do find that i don't have as much to throw away 
that's right . 
and , uh , i don't know what they could do more of exactly around here right now other than , uh , 
what are some of the things they don't recycle . 
oh , one thing i thought about the other day were batteries , 
just everyday regular batteries .
and , yet , what am i going to do when i have a couple double a batteries to toss out . 
and they don't take , 
probably going to throw them in your trash .
that's what happens 
well , there are places that take car batteries , 
but i wonder if they would take , 
i mean , not that it would  , 
kind of a pain to , you know , drive over somewhere special for two little tiny batteries 
but i think the city one could possibly look into that or something . 
that's true . 
uh , if they've got these bins for all the other little items , 
i'm sure if people will have batteries , uh , you know , quite often 
that's true . 
uh , when i was home those few days around thanksgiving and uh , the truck came by , well , we all ran out to watch it because , you know , we'd never really seen it 
and one thing i thought was interesting was that the driver had something on his belt that he , uh , scanned across the little bar code 
oh , is that right ? 
and he just pulled this thing kind of out of his pocket and just , you know , scanned it , 
so i don't know what that was reading it for 
 but , uh 
registering our garbage .
 they must be trying to keep track of  , you know , who is doing it , or what , i guess . 
i don't know . 
wouldn't it be nice if you could get a credit back at the end of the year .
ooh , for those who are really cooperating . 
now , that would encourage it . 
well , except i know it would just not be cost effective . 
they've already got all this money out on uh , getting the trucks and hiring people to work them . 
i'm sure they couldn't afford 
but the garbage , uh , 
now there is just one garbage man that comes 
oh , yeah . 
so that's interesting . 
uh , also , slightly off the subject , but our big green garbage thing got stolen . 
oh , it did ? 
and we called the city 
and , uh , they brought us a new one 
and they did not charge us . 
and they said that between three and four hundred have been stolen . 
oh , my goodness . 
isn't that sad ?
and just , 
you know , 
they paid for those things anyway . 
oh , and they must be ,
or , our taxes do . 
i mean , of course , we were hoping we weren't going to have to pay for it , you know 
 but , i mean , what would somebody do with them . 
is that right ? .
well , i never thought about that , 
but there is an arlington , 
and i was thinking 
birmingham . 
the only birmingham i could think of was alabama . 
it's funny how many names have been used , uh , all over the country . 
well , tell me what kind of books have you read ? 
well , to tell you the truth , i've been going to college for the last four years 
so mainly ,
no , um , 
 but , you know , sometimes biogr , 
i just read one about grace kelley . 
i love to read about real people . 
to me , half the time it's more fascinating than some of these made up stories .
it is , 
because you know it's really and truly 
it happened . 
you know , i read one about bob hope that i liked . 
i'm like you , 
if it's not a heavy biography , you know 
i used to like to read about royalty a lot . 
when i was younger i read about every king and queen that lived , i think , in europe . 
that was my thing for a while . 
i was trying to think , uh , 
i read uh , a novel that used the names of like princess di and prince phillip coming over here to be entertained and all , 
and there was a murder . 
oh , really . 
seems like it was the spy went dancing , or something like that . 
oh , it sounds like fun . 
it was a lot of fun because they used these real names , you know . 
wonder if it was by one of those famous writers , you know 
margaret truman daniels writes a lot those . 
in fact i believe it was 
sounds like something she would write . 
i think it was by her , now that you mention it , because someone had given it to me , 
and it was . 
i've heard that you know , her books are really interesting , 
and they always sell well . 
and , uh , 
well , when you use real people like that , i think 
brings it to life . 
i know , uh , some of the british people laugh at us because we're so enthralled with their royalty . 
but you know , that's like them being enthralled with our football and so forth , you know . 
i know , 
our movie stars . 
our movie stars , 
because it's totally different concept to us . 
oh , right . 
i haven't had a chance to read a lot lately either . 
i have read , uh , mostly novels . 
i went to visit my daughter in florida 
 and i took a novel with me , uh , and read it at thanksgiving time , 
and , uh , it was , uh , one of those generation novels , you know 
oh , yes . 
starts out when they're small and continues through generations 
oh , i always like those . 
 and i like that . 
have you ever read anything by susan howatch ? 
isn't she fabulous ? 
oh , once you st , 
i don't like to get one of her books 
i'll skip everything just to get back to the book .
i stayed up one night , i think until two 
oh , yeah . 
she's just a , 
i don't know , 
how often does she come out with them . 
i probably have missed the last few since i've been back in school . 
well , no , 
it seems like she doesn't write as often as , oh , well , like danielle steele and those silly things . 
she writes the same thing . 
well , she can turn them out overnight , i swear . 
 and they're the same silly things , 
i mean , if you've read one , i mean it's , 
i've never read a whole one of hers , i don't think . 
and think how rich she is . 
wouldn't i , you know , 
i'm criticizing her , 
and wouldn't i like to have her money 
oh , yeah . 
 because they go from hardback to paperback 
and she has millions of them . 
and then make movies out of some of them . 
you know , mini series and so forth , 
and it seems to me like susan howatch does not write as often . 
i have not seen as many of hers . 
well , hers are so involved , 
and they're so 
i think she does a lot of research , too . 
i do too , 
so she couldn't possibly turn them out like some of these popular 
but oh , her books are just incredible . 
you know , i , 
 well , no , uh , 
i really just thought about it now 
but there's just , 
maybe it's because they take so much in . 
i don't know . 
maybe they're just too involved for the average person to go and sit through them , you know . 
they're so big 
they're such , you know , 
it would be like another gone with the wind , i guess 
and maybe that turns people off , 
but look at gone with the wind , you know . 
oh , i know . 
it's about one of my favorite movies . 
uh , have you , uh , gotten into scarlett yet ? 
i wasn't too   .
that's exactly what i was going to say . 
i was amazed , 
because i , 
in the beginning when it was you know , on route coming out 
and then when it came out , all i heard was just , oh , how bad it was , that i didn't even want to get it . 
me , either . 
do you know anyone that's read it ? 
i haven't heard of anybody that's read it , either . 
i think it was on the bestseller list , though 
  are you there ? 
now tell me your favorite team . 
uh , baseball ? 
 , been intrigued with the rangers , uh , more so with , uh , uh , their management than anything else . 
that closely , 
but , uh , you know , since i live here so close to arlington , uh , that's the team that i've been kind of following . 
so we'll have to talk about the future 
what are your thinkings on what they can do , what they'll be able to do ? 
well , i think that , uh , you know , with , uh , so much controversy over ruben sierra not signing and asking us for so much money , it's , um , you know , i think 
i'm not real sure about th , 
do you know anything about ruben sierra's , uh , 
 and the rangers go up a little bit , 
but a little bit you know , from thirty million dollars or thirtyfive mil , 
that's a lot of money . 
i think the entire baseball , 
they're the ones that probably are paying the highest . 
they are . 
 and i think this is absolutely ridiculous . 
and uh , that they ought to , 
i'm not real sure that they should pay him that much money . 
i think they should , uh , uh , pay him what his salary is going to be , uh , and let him , 
because he's got one more year before he turns into a free agent . 
that's right . 
and then , uh , who knows , 
if he produces next year , they may have to end up paying him anyway , 
but if he doesn't , then his market value will go down 
and they can pick him up for a lot less than , 
what i saw on the news today , that 
buechele was back just to visit . 
i'm awful sorry he's not still . 
 oh , yeah , 
but you know , what , he , 
that was a great deal for him . 
oh , i'm sure it was . 
 and , uh , he just signed on , uh , 
i think it was like a five year deal with , uh 
so , you know , he's real happy there . 
as far as the rangers are concerned , definitely need some pitching . 
yes , sir . 
uh , and so you know i , 
 well , what do you think of howse , who is the coach for the pitchers ? 
well , you know , i was just looking at the news tonight , 
and they showed was helping out , uh , 
his assistant . 
and i think that's a great addition . 
i mean , he seemed to know what he was doing 
 and , uh , 
i really wish they could see fit to get rid of howse . 
 and i'm not going to stand up , you know on my , 
but i'm ,
and i'm not fond of grieves . 
of , uh , tom grieve yet , 
but howse might be a different , uh , situation , 
and i think you're probably right , you know , some changes in , uh , pitching coach , maybe 
and , um , 
well , i'm just gullible enough that i think bobby valentine is , um , uh , doing all right 
and i'm sure , 
 oh , i know , 
i know so , 
but i would like so much for these rangers to get their act together and give , um , oh , uh , nolan ryan the support he needs . 
you know , it's too bad that , uh , it has to be a fortytwo year old guy uh , the rangers , you know . 
i understand . 
they need to have some young guys that can take the lead 
well , oh , i have so many mixed emotions about all this . 
but i think with their new stadium , they should go and let , 
well , if you're from iowa , you must be very artsy crafty . 
everyone i've ever known from the midwest can do everything with their hands . 
oh , well , actually i'm from california 
and before then i was from utah . 
i didn't know anyone ever moved from california to iowa ? 
well , i grew up in california , 
and then i went to school in utah , 
and i got married there 
and we stayed there for a while , 
and then , now we're in iowa .
i'm teasing , only because i'm from indiana . 
 oh , really . 
 i like the midwest . 
but i married a texan , 
and they have a way of dragging you back home . 
that you do things with your hands 
and i do water color , 
and i , um , sew 
and i do fabric painting . 
oh , you do a lot then . 
do you do needlepoint also and cross stitching ? 
i haven't tried any needlepoint yet . 
how about you ? 
um , actually i'm pretty untalented .
oh , right . 
i used to do a lot of knitting and crocheting , um , 
but i don't know , 
somehow i don't have the time anymore . 
but i have all these friends that wherever you go , they sit down and the next thing you know , they pull out of their , uh , 
oh , really . 
 and in december everyone was doing stockings , you know 
oh , gosh . 
oh , yeah , 
well those take a lot of time . 
i only can do things that are pretty fast , because we just , um , got our baby last year , 
and i just don't have the patience to just , you know , do something . 
is this your first baby ? 
have you crocheted or knitted any baby clothes or baby blankets ? 
that's the only thing , 
and i did a quilt , 
let's see , i've done a quilt for our baby 
and i've done a quilt for our bed , 
but i mean , 
did you embroidery the pattern and then quilt it yourself , 
um , our baby's quilt , it was like the design , 
i just went around the design 
i didn't piece it or anything like that 
but , uh , 
but you actually hand quilted it yourself ? 
 did you need a loom , 
or were you a , 
was it small enough that you could just hold it ? 
um , i put it on the quilting frame . 
are you familiar with that ? 
but , um , again , my mother back in indiana , 
we had a quilting frame in our basement , 
and she would quilt whole quilts by herself . 
oh , my god . 
um , yes , 
i was always amazed . 
i have one of them . um , 
but , uh , you know , to have the quilting frame and then to actually do that , it's a tremendous amount of work . 
well , i haven't done tons of them .
but , um , i used to do more before we got our baby , 
oh , you think , children , 
you can , um , use crafts to make wonderful things for children . 
i think when babies , 
i think afghans are wonderful . 
and they'll wear them .
 well , one thing that i like about this fabric painting thing is i can just make a t shirt and put a little ruffle around it and then , um , cut out a little pattern from some material , like flowers or something , and make , um , a design or , you know , a little arrangement or something on the shirt and , you know , fuse it on with heat and bond , or whatever and then paint around it . 
and i usually sew around the flower , whatever first , 
and then i paint around it 
so you can't see the stitching as much . 
does that make sense to you ? 
oh , yes , 
it's , uh , funny that you said . 
for christmas , my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts 
and they were lovely , 
but when i washed them , although i took the precaution of turning them inside out 
oh , sure . 
oh , really . 
so i went and bought just some cloth glue and glued it all back 
and i bought the paint and redid most of the edges 
 and it was salvageable  , 
and i , 
but it's , 
so i'm familiar with that , 
but i think you're very clever to , um , sew around the edges . 
i think gluing alone , certainly if you wash it any amount of time , it 
someone told me that they had done it both ways , 
and uh , a loose zigzag even helps .
and , um , 
so how do you just figure    , 
well , you know , it depends upon our weather here . you know , 
today was a beautiful day 
it was like , uh , uh , summer day . 
it was seventy degrees 
it's a , uh , ultra suede skirt and a blouse with a sweater , cardigan 
because i had some appointments at the office today , some interviews 
and so i had to dress up anyway 
and then i wore heels , you know . 
but when it rains a lot , which is has been doing here a lot lately , uh , very often , you know , wear , uh , pants and boots 
so how do you dress ? 
um , when i was a teacher , um , in utah , i would generally wear , um , dresses and heels and things like that , 
 and even when it , um , rained and snowed i just braved it 
and i wore heels anyway .
 i can see , 
i've been a teacher so has my daughter 
and i know that we very often wore heels despite the fact that ,
i know , 
it might kill you to go up and  ,
that's right . 
but you're going to look nice for the kids .
that's right 
oh , oh , yeah . 
well , i need all the height i can get .
i do too . 
 so to be taller than some of the boys in the bigger grades , 
 oh , yeah . 
we too . um , 
if it looked really dangerous then i would wear boots 
but then i would change , um , into heels ,
so , um , 
of course , we wear , uh , an unlined boots , you know , 
it has a heel on it . 
they're the kind of boots that i wear to work 
and we wear them , you know , 
they're a leather boot that you wear 
and as i said they have a regular heel on them , high heel . 
and we wear them a lot with shirts and things . 
uh , it's kind of a , 
i can't say constant down here in texas that you wear these boots . 
they're not a cowboy boot , 
but they're just a real pretty boot , 
but they keep your feet nice and toasty from the rain . 
huh . well , um , 
of course , you probably wear coats a lot . 
yeah , um , 
so i did , 
 oh , my goodness 
so then you had to . 
and then the third year we , um , got heating 
so it was nice .
but of course , here we wear a light weight jacket a lot you know , you know , 
 oh , that's nice . 
and , uh , that's very seldom 
it depends upon our winter . 
we have a few days you might wear a winter coat , you know , 
but most of the time you can wear a sweater 
and we just don't wear coats much . 
we often laugh about even when it turns chilly . 
we're wearing something lightweight or no jacket because we're so used to running around like that . 
oh . nice . 
well  , 
it's really different . 
let's put it that way . 
are you not teaching anymore ? 
uh , no , 
and , um , i'm working at a day care right now . 
i see . 
and so the way i dress is really different because i'm working in the nursery room with kids from six months to like twenty months . 
oh , so you don't wear heels anymore i'll bet . 
i wear , uh , tennis shoes ,
more practical . 
it doesn't matter if i have to wash it a hundred times or something . 
when you were teaching , did you ever have , uh , uh , a blue jean day or anything like that ? 
yeah , well , 
i know that some of the schools they have , uh , country western day or something like that one , you know , or tacky day , 
and i always thought it got out of hand when the teachers looked real tacky too . 
it's all right for the students , 
they look tacky a lot 
but i didn't think teachers should , you know . 
that's how i feel too . 
do you like , uh , uh , iowa ? 
but i've seen . a lot of things i'm not used to yet , um , 
where did you live before ? 
um , we lived in utah before 
 and i grew up in california . 
oh , well , that's quite a change from california to utah , 
well , uh , what is your favorite kind of music ? 
well , i have to say my favorite type of music would probably be , uh , classical music . 
oh , same here . 
oh , really . 
what type of music do you like in the classical area , 
or what era do you like the most ? 
oh , well , i guess i like a wide range . uh , everything uh , from baroque through at least some modern music . 
and my wife and i these days are especially into opera . 
we've been sort of opera fans for a few years now . 
well , we , uh , generally , 
the places we've gone they sing in the original languages . 
like the dallas opera here normally does , i guess . 
 uh , if i don't know the story line and , um , i don't speak the language , then i have difficult time , comprehending what's going on . 
well , one thing that's helped us a lot is that , uh , uh , video tape 
 and so we have quite a collection of those , 
and you watch them at home , 
and they have subtitles , 
so you figure out what's going on after a while , 
and then you can enjoy it in the , uh , theater . 
but , you know , the , uh , dallas opera now has , uh , super titles on all their performances i think . 
what is that ? 
well , on a screen up above the stage . 
oh , i didn't know that . 
that can help people like me . 
in fact , they even do that for operas sung in english , because it is hard to understand the words sometimes . 
 well , i can understand that . 
so , i'd say ,
well , i really like vivaldi . 
uh , he's , uh , definitely one of the top of that era . 
i like baroque music , 
i like full body music , uh , um , um , with brass and winds , woodwinds , instruments , you know . 
course i like , uh , also string instruments , 
and i have two string instruments in my house . uh , instrument players , 
both my sons play string instruments . 
one plays the cello 
and the other one plays the viola . 
so , i get to go to at least four or five concerts a year .
how old are they ? 
one is thirteen and one is eleven . 
yes   .
well , you've got half a string quartet there . 
we're on our way . 
so , uh , um , i try to enjoy all of it . 
well , since you seem to like , uh , italian music , have you ever , uh , gotten into gabrielli or anybody there in that era , the , uh , period right before , actually before vivaldi , i guess ? 
but , um , a lot of the , um , music i don't know about , uh , as far as the titles , 
and i have to listen to it , and 
um , i do belong to a musical heritage society . 
oh , yes , 
do you belong to that ? 
but i think i know what it is . 
isn't that a , uh , uh , see , 
can't you get records through that or something , recordings ? 
uh , they know have them on compact disc or 
and , uh , they do a lot of original recordings themselves . 
i think , uh . 
but uh , they also , uh , go to the different composers , or the different , i guess , 
what do you call them the guys that orchestrate 
uh , yes , 
they go to conductors , uh , 
 and they actually have them perform the music , 
and they record it . 
so , they're actually commissioned performances . 
a lot of them are . 
or they will kno , 
and they will , uh , record the music at that time . 
and so , uh , it is , uh , uh , high quality grade music , 
and , of course , now they also have a jazz section , 
and they also have a , uh , more contemporary and american 
well , i had heard good things about the , uh , music heritage society , 
but if i get involved in one of those things , i end up spending all my money on 
well , you can control it . 
i uh , almost , uh , bankrupted myself out of college as a freshman when i got into the columbia record club many years ago . 
oh , really . 
he got a bonus record , 
and i got a lot of bills .
i see . 
so we have to watch that . 
well , that's good . 
uh , do you play any instrument yourself ? 
how do you feel about the viet nam war ? 
huh , well , um , you know , i guess it's pretty deep feelings , uh , 
i just , uh , went back and rented , uh , the movie , what is it , good morning viet nam 
 and , uh . 
i saw that as well . 
got to kind of help me put together the feelings . 
i really appreciated uh , the , uh , fellow just wouldn't do it , you know , 
the guy's gouging your eyes out , 
what are you going to do ? 
you know , what for him to finish me off .
and , uh , that kind of asian philosophy 
 well , were 
and you ? 
i was born in sixtyseven , 
um , you know , well , both my brothers were , um , draft age , 
but neither of them wound up going over , which , i think they were very happy for . 
well , personally , uh , you know , uh , i just went in limbo . 
i had a passport and was ready to go 
i mean , i just didn't know . 
so , uh . 
well , um , so well do you feel that it was worth what we did over there ? 
um , yeah , 
just a second . 
now . well , mark , um , what was that again ? 
um , the investment in lives and money was worth it ? 
i totally agree with that . um . 
what effects do you think it's had on our country ? 
downside . um , uh , well , 
the   says we should , uh , go into the grief that's there 
and , you know ,   presidents have always avoided that 
so it's pretty serious , really , you know , 
lot of things that aren't being addressed . 
i think   you know , that's pretty typical you know , that nothing was really addressed , 
 you know , it was never 
we announced that we were going to war , 
it was such a gradual and subtle , you know 
gulf of tonkin , uh , resolution 
and was it a dolphin or a torpedo . 
you remember that ? 
only it was foggy 
and finally president johnson said , well , they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo . 
isn't that something ? 
uhhuh . um , 
so , um , in this past war , in the persian gulf war 
hey mark 
we'll see you . 
but i guess , 
so , uh , mike , what are your opinions on , uh , trial by jury ? 
well i work for an insurance company 
so i see a lot of , uh , verdicts that are pretty crazily decided . um , by juries particularly , 
and i know in england the judges set all of the awards . 
you know juries will decide the guilt or innocence , 
but then they leave the awards up to more learned people . 
and i think maybe that avoids some of these totally ridiculous , you know , like millions and millions of dollars .
that seems to make sense 
but leave it up to the more experienced person who knows how it fits into the , uh , kind of the rate for different   .
 oh , exactly . 
each individual jury really doesn't have any perception of what , um , you know , if you will the going , uh , award should be for a certain type of case , you know , within some kind of range . 
when you get one way out like that 
but then really doesn't wind up penalizing the person that they went after . 
who it really penalizes is their insurance company which then translates into higher rates for all of us .
you know , they're not going to sit there and lose money . 
if they are losing money , then they're going to raise rates . 
they ha , 
 so it all comes filtering down to us all individually . 
and , uh , granted some people need to be compensated if they have really been wronged ,
do you think the jury should have a dollar figure for losing an arm , a dollar figure for losing different body parts ? 
i don't know . 
you know some of the health insurance is written that way . you know , that , uh , if you buy an accident and death or dismemberment policy , you know , it s , pre specified in the policy so much 
but i don't know that you can necessarily put a value on somebody's limb ,
i think maybe you look at , uh , the age of the person and their station in life with that . 
i mean maybe you don't award an eightyfive year old guy the same thing that you would award a twentyone year old . 
i think it has to be some kind of common sense applied there . 
and there may be where the judiciary is a little more learned about that type of thing because they can be schooled in that kind of thing , 
i don't know . .
you know , to get into the economics of things , uh , 
because if they wheel somebody into a courtroom and the jury's heart goes out to that person and they do one of these mega awards ,
that's true . 
if it's a company , you know that they're insured . unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance which is another pet peeve of mine when they do award punitive damages , 
i think those should be uninsurable . 
i think those should have to be paid by the corporation itself that , 
 oh , out of thei , r , 
as opposed to the insurance paying the bills , 
 well , we're , 
and something happens . 
one of their employees causes damage or something . 
 sure . that's what they buy insurance for . 
do they get insured from other insurance companies 
or how does that work ? 
well , i was just talking about any company . 
 oh , okay , 
your talking about corpor , 
and one of the employees actually is driving by with a forklift 
and he pushes the wrong button 
and he drops a load of lumber on somebody 
and it injures ,
insurance should pay for that . 
but in some instances you're going to put companies out of business by taking that stance , if they have to take it out of their own retained earnings . 
well i'm not talking about any loss . 
i was talking about only losses that are judged for a punitive damage which is another category of , the juries are awarding damages these days based on the person's actual injuries and what they are due . 
and then they are awarding a second amount as punishment to the company which is usually a lot less . 
but it's an amount they're , designed to sting them a little for their ,
for , oh , th , 
and unfortunately the , 
lately the courts have been deciding that those could be paid for by insurance too . 
so again , it never really penalizes ,
that will , 
they can go right on doing the same old thing they always used to . 
and if they know some practice is wrong , you know , 
i'm not talking about your isolated occurrences , 
i'm talking more about you know , the thing that they know , 
maybe they're willfully manufacturing something that they know is hurting people out there 
and they continue to do it even after they become aware 
then i think they ought to have to pay something out of their own pocket . 
go ahead .
oh , okay .
the , uh , subject is child care and how to determine child care , 
and that's , uh , an interesting one for me to talk about since i have no children , 
but i did run a child care facility for a while . 
and , uh , have some , 
well , you should have some opinions on that , then . 
uh , it's , uh , an interesting experience to be a surrogate or parent for a lot of people there , 
and , uh , it's also very interesting in terms of how people choose the child care facilities .
well , i guess if i were going to choose , i mean , my first consideration would be safety . 
 uh , health . 
and , uh , i guess my third consideration would be , uh , 
well , right . 
uh , in texas , we have to meet certain state standards in order to operate like a small home level 
so you meet the standards , 
but then after that there's a lot more . 
i think it's important  as  the safety and health and that kind of stuff , is qualification of people who work there , and in hiring people who would work at just 
because somebody has a child or , uh , likes children doesn't really mean that they're qualified to give the child the kind of supervision and training 
oh , absolutely .
as a matter of fact , i believe that the safety and health , uh , issues , uh , depend in a very direct way on the people who are working with the children . 
and that was the most difficult thing of all , to find the right people , the qualified people . 
and it's the most difficult of all for a parent , judge , uh 
but if he's a space cadet and doesn't watch the children , and be aware of what the safety hazards are , 
oh , exactly . 
and the other thing that's difficult in , uh , it's a  too small  setting , like a day care center is to find the right program of enrichment for the child , because you don't want to just warehouse the child , 
and i didn't want to run an institution where that was the case , where all we were doing were warehousing because the first four , five years or so important 
and you have to have the right kind of enrichment 
and and he's watched and his physical needs are cared for , 
but also his , uh , developmental needs are cared for , too . 
maybe the right thing to do is to , uh , then you say the first four or five years are the most important , and i think i would agree with that , they both take four or five years off and devote to parenting . 
that would be lovely . 
get rid of all these child care centers , at least for young kids below the age of six . 
 , uh , and then , of course , to make up for that , uh , the , uh , parents would have to work in their later years longer , you know , 
in other words , they probably in the twenties . uh , 
well , that's an interesting thought because , 
but then they have to work from age thirty or forty to age seventy or eighty or ninety . 
that would be okay .
in terms of not warehousing people and letting people be productive for as long as they can be . 
well , you know , from , uh , industrial , uh , base to , uh , information base 
and so 
that's exactly right . 
all you have to do is have a sharp mind , 
and i believe that , uh , mental acuity is easy to maintain , if you just simply continue to exercise your mind . 
 uh , into the seventies , eighties , even nineties for that matter , 
if they didn't have to do a lot of physical , uh , labor , they could maintain , uh , 
your turn . 
uh , i don't think they should abolish it .
i think if they put it into force more often , they wouldn't have as many problems as they've got . 
but not for petty theft ? 
for major things like premeditated murder . mass murders . uh , you know , that type of thing . 
i don't think it should just be used loosely . 
 well , it should be used as a deterrent do you think ? 
or should it be used , uh , 
to prevent these people from ever getting out on the street .
and they go down the line ten years 
and then on some little technicality they get out and on the streets again doing the same they did before . 
and , you know , that's about the only thing . 
like and stuff like that or manslaughter , you know , 
i don't think they should do that . 
 well , you know , there's this old , uh , jewish , is it , saying about an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth . 
oh , well , i guess , 
you know , i've never had anybody in my immediate family , uh , murdered 
and so i really wouldn't know . 
but i feel like if i did , i probably would feel that way . 
well , one of the things i was thinking about is , uh , you know , from society's point of view , if you put a value on each person , what you want to do is to maximize the end game value . 
so if you have someone that destroys that value 
of course , you have to also put value on the criminal . 
so if you terminate him , that's a loss of value . 
well , that's true .
so , you know , if you weight everyone equally , then you have to say , well the likelihood of not terminating him , 
if you don't terminate him , the likelihood is expected value of loss of life is greater than one person . 
in other words , you'd have to murder more than one other person 
besides him . 
another way you could do it is weight this value by , uh , the value to society of the people . uh , which is pretty delicate thing to do . 
but one way of doing it is , uh , by income . 
so if this guy doesn't make a great deal of money ,
his life isn't worth very much then .
and so , uh , the likelihood that , you know , maybe is , uh , integrated over the income of the people , uh , that he murders is maybe , you know , a loss of , who knows , eight hundred thousand dollars . 
uh , but if he only , uh , you know , integrated income over the expected remainder of his life of is , uh , .
of course , one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm , is you find that uh , to , uh , terminate older people than younger people since the integration of their income over the rest of their lives is going to be less .
i suppose you could say , well that has something to do with potential for rehabilitation . 
potential . 
i mean that's the key right there . potential . 
 now , or not . 
now that's all fine and well and , uh , good philosophical . 
but if you're involved yourself , personally 
 uh , i know i have a friend whose , uh , son was murdered , uh , on the night before his sixteenth birthday . 
and let me tell you , uh , i knew them personally , uh , not intimately , but quite well 
and , uh , you're talking about real trauma . i mean trauma that extends beyond the counting of bodies . 
i can imagine . 
the father , you know , 
of course , a parent losing a teenage child is about as bad as it could possibly get , i think , in terms of psychological impact . 
uh , and , 
was he murdered ? 
did they find who killed him ? 
oh , yes . 
and he is on trial for capital murder . 
so it hasn't been a long time ago . 
just recently . 
and , of course , now , you know , you go through two or three hundred years of appeals process 
but  , 
that appeals process , i mean , it's what , you know , really , you know , just drags out and out and out . 
my brotherinlaw here in texas , well actually in houston 
and , uh , he , 
go ahead . 
uh , well , you know , uh , i think public service is a worthy thing 
and as a matter of fact there are a lot of programs , uh , such as peace corps that promote that . 
probably the most popular one but , uh , one that is not typically recognized as such is the boy scouts . 
uh , i know that a scout now and , uh , is thinking about his eagle 
and , uh , in order to get eagle , you have to have merit badges in , uh , citizenship in the community 
 right  .
and you have to do a public service project .
uh , i think the question is posed somewhat strangely because , uh , it's talking about a requirement for 
 uhhuh  .
and , of course , is a voluntary activity . 
referring to , uh , something , kind of , uh , alternative to the draft , you know . 
either you have , uh , military service or some sort of alternative , nonmilitary service for a few years . 
of course , uh , uh , military service falls under the category , uh , of a public service . 
and , so , uh , one of the things that would fulfill at least the nominal , uh , qualifications set forth in the charge is military service or draft . 
 huh  . ight , 
but i agree with you , that probably is not what was comprehended . 
there are other 
 well , i , 
 but i suspect that was not what they had in mind either . 
or , uh , 
for years there has been an idea batted around of having some sort of alternative , uh , public service for , uh , young people to go into , uh , after high school . 
uh , kind of in lieu of the draft to be in the military , you know . 
well you can go into the military 
or you can do this other thing for one or two years to kind of serve the community and learn about things . 
and i'm not a particular fan of the military 
but i have seen a lot of young guys go in that don't have really a clue as to what they want to do with their lives and aren't terribly disciplined , you know , even just personal discipline about what they want to do 
and they come out 
and now they have at least some marginally marketable skills and more discipline . 
and submit my own will to the will of the sargent or whatever , at least for a short period of time , i can accomplish a lot 
and it's a good lesson for a lot of young men to learn . that they don't need to be , you know , cowboys . 
they don't need to be out there uh , you know , constantly flaunting their ego to get things accomplished . 
 and , you know , for some young men , that's good . 
for me , it would have been lousy idea , uh , because 
and i went 
why is that ? 
but , uh , you know , for some people that's good . 
i don't particular like the fact that it's the military , you know , 
  and the whole point of the military is to kill people essentially . as an instrument of u s policy . 
 oh , no , 
it's to defend the nation against external evils . 
 that's another debate . 
but , uh , it's , uh , 
well , it depends on that we have a defense oriented military or 
and , well , aggressive oriented , 
i mean , military action which was in the persian gulf and wasn't anywhere near the united states 
and uh , you know , it was definitely a projection of u s power on the other side of the globe , 
so , at any rate , this is getting off the topic 
but i , 
it would be neat if there were an alternative that could instill the same sort of personal discipline and sense of purpose and , uh , sense of community that the boy scouts , 
 actually , i've been involved in electronics a long time . uh , in computers 
and i have really resisted the impulse to get one for the home .
 oh yeah . 
i got one for my son . a macintosh 
it's a real easy to use color , uh , computer 
and i got a very nice printer that goes along with it 
and he uses it for his school work . 
well , i'm currently in school 
so i've had an i b m clone , i guess , for a couple of years now , which i've been trying , continually upgrading i guess . 
and , uh , i've found that i pretty much become addicted to it 
and i can't really , 
i've found that most of homework assignments   really require some sort of computer , uh , simulation or analysis , 
very essential for me . 
schools have them , 
uh , but lot of times so difficult to get on them at school . 
it's much more convenient to have one at home . 
where you going to school ? 
at georgia tech . 
i see . 
in engineering ? 
yes , actually . 
so that explains all the , uh , computer assignments . 
it , uh , 
well , do you use your p c for things other than explicit computer work ? 
and , uh , uh , i have a program which allows me to access a , uh , weather data bank 
so i can , like , check up on the weather around the country or whatever  which is  a hobby . 
so , it provides other means other than just strict , uh , you know , computations and so on , 
so . do you have a computer for yourself at home ? 
and i really sort of have the feeling that word processing is a big market for 
 oh , yeah . 
at work , uh , i'm a technologist , uh , 
and i , in the past , have done a great deal of , uh , system development just through , uh , software development programming . 
uh , but now i find myself using the computer , 
even the computer at work is primarily a , uh , word processing system 
do you use email and like that ? 
emil of all my time . 
uh , i have modem   night computer 
so i can log into which can be useful . 
but , uh , yeah 
that and word processing is 
 while  i tend to , 
i mean , obviously , i do on my computer , uh , whether it's term papers or even some smaller homework assignments . 
so i don't know , really become my mainstay i guess . 
i can't even remember , 
actually i don't think i've ever used a typewriter to do a report . because my family , when i was growing up , we got a basic computer . t r s eighty when they first came out . 
and i even used that to do my first reports when i was in junior high , 
huh . well i'm a oldtimer . 
i did my master's thesis on , uh , a typewriter . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , i rented an i b m selectric . 
and it was a pretty big deal . 
it must have been tough . 
it's a little bit strange for me . 
i did my master's thesis , uh , last year 
and i did that on a computer 
and it seems like , 
i just can't imagine how people did it before . 
it must have been just so much work .
it was just a completely different world then . 
you used your son's macintosh then ? 
do you like that kind of computer ? 
i like it from a distance really . 
i see the packages on it , uh , that are available 
and it's nice . 
i really don't use it myself . 
uh , i like to stay far away from 
uh , so i let my son do it 
it's sort of a joke 
but it's really true , 
the oldtimers , even the people who are technologists don't know how to operate these electronic things like v c r s and whatnot 
and the kids , they just take to it like candy . 
well , if the interface is there so that it's like fun to use and the challenge  , 
taxes are really a necessary evil in a civilized society . 
but really , people get upset at taxes because it's more efficient to do things yourself . 
for the benefit of others , you know . 
how much of your resource should you dedicate to , uh , making things work for others ? 
have you , uh , you know , ever thought , you know , just how much of that money should go to other people that really don't deserve it ? 
but they're giving it to other people that don't really need it either , 
but yet they accept it . 
well , the thing of it is ,
like so many people do . 
and , uh , probably a good woman , 
just con somebody to take care of me . 
and   then you don't have to be on the tax roll . 
are very difficult kind of thing 
and everybody really hates it . 
it was very timely . 
my deductions 
so i wind up 
so , uh , you know , that's always a smile . 
but , of course , you know , i've paid it in 
and i should calculate it better . 
so i'm a federal employee . 
 uh , well , i th , 
i think that people that work for the government are just as against taxes as everybody else , you know . 
 i belong  .
oh i've got all four feet in the trough , you know , being a federal employee . 
 uh , who gets benefits . 
like a bond issue 
but there , 
not tax revolt country . 
i mean there's too many , 
have all four feet in the trough , you know . plus our snout , right up to our ears . 
so , you know , it's not exactly that kind of a place that you want to , you know , get into a tax revolt situation . 
but , uh , uh , i , 
for taxes on my four bedroom house , you know . 
as people get older and older , uh , you know , they think about retirement and that sort of thing 
they're building old people's homes , uh , you know , at tax expense . 
well i think , you know , the old people ought to just bail out of here and go where it's cheaper . 
at thirtythree hundred dollars or thirtyfive hundred dollars i'm paying in taxes , 
why rent a house for that , 
you know . it's the taxes here 
course i don't know whether i want to go to bulverde or not , you know 
but , uh , there's certainly lots of inexpensive places where the services are poorer . 
and i think really the only place you can really reduce the amount of taxes you pay is to move to an area where the services are poorer . 
if you're not going to use them , then you want to be in environment . 
that's a strategy i think to lessen their cost of living . you know , 
i'm five or six   years before i'm eligible to retire 
and i'm saying well , you know , i really can't stay here , uh , as a retiree . 
after you retire , 
it's too expensive . 
i'm going to have go out you know , in , you know , east fork someplace .
my parents are in the same situation , you know . 
their home is paid for 
but still their taxes are so high , that , you know , my father doesn't feel like he can retire because they couldn't pay their taxes . 
and they have no children in school or , you know , anything now . 
they don't use any of those services that a lot of the taxes go towards . 
they redecorated in nineteen seventyfive , you know . 
uh , yeah . 
and they're not doing it again , you know . 
so . well , it's certainly , uh , uh , 
you must be a t i employee . 
you're not a t i , 
who do you work for ? 
i don't work . 
i'm a student . 
i go to school . 
i'm in nursing school .
uh , generally i get , uh , you know , most of my news , uh , in the , you know , weekly magazines like time , newsweek of , uh , you know , the wall street journal and , of course , the local paper . 
but , uh , and go through a paper , you know , exhaust the details . 
so that's why i concentrate on weekly magazines . 
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like ? 
well , yes . 
it gives me , you know , the high points of what's going on . 
uh , but many times , uh , you know , uh , the local news kind of suffers , you know . 
but here i am , you know , cheek by jowl with our nation's capital 
 oh , that's right . 
you're very close actually . 
but , uh , i think , is great .
but generally , they're more sound bitish , you know , kind of thing 
and i don't really , 
a lot of my information comes from several sources . 
probably pretty high up on the list is national public radio .
uh , i think it's fairly objective 
and i always like the letters that they read which tend to accuse them of being too liberal and too conservative . 
and while there's an inherent , uh , filtering process going on just by the letters they choose to read , uh , i always figure it's a good thing when any given group is being accused by each side of , uh , favoring the other side . 
that's potential indication of balance . 
and , generally , i really do believe they are pretty balanced . 
uh , i also read time magazine 
and we get one of the daily newspapers around here where we go through various sections uh , of the articles and the front section 
and , uh , 
well the mercury and the chronicle are the only things that are really , can 
oh , you st , 
did you use to live around here ? 
i use to work at anteks . 
 oh , okay . 
oh , yeah , 
i know exactly where that is . 
anteks , amdahl and places like that . 
we get the mercury which i generally think is actually a pretty good newspaper .
the newspaper i really been impressed with it when i've read it at times , at , well the los angeles times .
and i like a lot of the articles there . 
is called c span . 
i enjoy , 
see both c spans here . 
if i watch any news program , it will be macneil lehrer .
that were run of marion berry's drug bust 
was run on that 
that would have been interesting . 
i think that's always fascinating . 
i wish we had something . 
 uh , you know , when it first tuned in on that i , you know , 
it's one that's , 
i think it was , somebody was another person . 
and i , 
and everybody was , you know , making noise in the background . 
but it's usually the prime minister , 
here's this dude in a wig 
 major  .
and then up jumps margaret thatcher off her green bench 
which could be another   of monty python . 
so i thought to myself , i can't wait . 
i'm going over you know , in midmay . 
approach my , uh , you know , 
this is how i discovered , you know , the prime minister's , you know , question and answer period , you know . 
i have seen that 
and , uh , aside from the level of wit which is much higher than , generally , in american politics , uh , which i really enjoy . i really like the fact that they have a chance to ask hard , real questions i think . 
and it's unlike the fairly controlled , uh , press conferences that presidents of the united states have here where they always seem , 
my favorite show is masterpiece theatre 
and it has been for a long time 
but i feel almost ashamed to say that to anybody now because i have never met anybody who likes it . 
do you by any chance ? 
oh , yes . 
you do! 
as a matter of fact , i prefer public television . 
and , uh , i particularly enjoy the english comedies ,
i watch mysteries too . 
is that what you're referring to ? 
that is good . 
i like , uh , 
do you read ? 
well that's the reason why i like both of those programs is because they're kind of based on books . 
and , the plots are more , um , challenging , you know , than the sitcoms of regular t v . 
well , unfortunately for us at least here in the united states , the only access we have to that of course is public television . 
i'm not a great television watcher in any respect 
but , uh , the watching , 
what i do watch is , uh , usually news and whatever is on public television . 
any kind of , 
i also uh , am very fond of great performances ,
me too . 
but , uh 
did you stay up late and catch this red dwarf ? 
no  , 
oh , that was a scream . 
as a matter of fact , uh , turner broadcasting ,
so i have concentrated on watching james bond movies ,
i used to like him too , 
he was my hero . 
in fact , i like sean connery to this day . 
well , they're showing uh , live and let die at this moment , 
and , it is the first appearance of roger moore as double oh seven . 
oh , he can never cut it .
that's true . 
i was just thinking that today , he did ,
he does . 
whereas , uh , sean connery has maintained the , uh , how would you , uh , ruddy look , 
i liked his accent too . 
and , he can even be in movies that are not , uh , uh , sexually oriented , 
and he still comes off great . 
well , you know when was it , last year or year before last , he was voted the sexiest actor in movies ,
he is . 
he had my vote double .
 i mean the man is sixtytwo years old . 
i don't care .
uh , but otherwise you know we , 
uh , with p b s and so forth . 
and i , 
oh , what's that about ? 
that was about the interior minister , 
it was a comedy , 
oh , yeah , 
the interior minister in england ,
i've seen it several times . 
it's a scream , 
but i have to go to bed , 
i have to get up and work the next morning . 
i wish they'd put those , 
it came on after doctor who ,
and it should , 
of course i li 
really it was , 
i don't think they should show it during prime time , 
but still ,
i know . 
well i'm not much of a television watcher . 
i read as i said ,
i read about two or three novels a week ,
what do you do ? 
what kind of work do you do ? 
i'm a payroll clerk . 
just an accounting clerk . 
at t i ? 
no , uh , 
and i work for a tire service ,
oh , i see . 
i'm from dallas . 
well the last two people who have called , both worked for t i 
and i just wondered . 
i think that's something we all ca , 
do you work for t i ? 
how did you hear , 
well i work , you know , 
they are gathering a data base for voice processing . 
and , that's my field of work also . 
so i know the people at t i who are doing this 
and i heard about it , 
so i called them and asked if i could participate . and , uh , 
 well , you know , speaking of public tv , have you caught any of this series on the bible ? 
i've heard well i mean that it's coming out with the idea that the bible's not true . 
well , no . 
that's , uh , 
you could interpret it that way . 
uh , i think what they are trying to say , is that there is a great deal of historical truth , 
but the interpretation that actually got into the writing of the bible itself is probably wrote the translation , that so much was lost in the translation , particularly since most of the translations were in greek . 
well , for example . in greek there are seven different words for love . 
so you can have , 
there's one word for love of your brother , one word for love of your wife , one word for , you know , uh , love of your father , and that sort of thing . 
so , as to those types of interpretations , uh , really made a difference in how one might interpret the bible now , and what it's at . 
so that's , you know , 
you can look at it as though they are saying it's not true , 
but there's too much historical fact involved just from were developed around that time , that are available .
so , you know , it depends on how you look at it . 
you can look at it , you know , 
if you want to say that it's proven that it isn't true , then you can very much look at it that way . 
i guess if you're looking for that , you're , 
that , uh , 
but , uh , we at least agree on what we enjoy . 
that's right . 
but , uh , i don't know if there is a time limit on this ,
surely we've made it . 
i think so too . 
let's just , 
it's been very pleasant talking to you , 
it was very nice talking to you . 
and have a good evening . 
you too . 
good night! 
uh , robert what substances do you think are the most , uh , likely causes of air pollution ? 
i don't , i mean , 
i guess it's the stuff that comes out of automobile exhaust , you know , 
they say in the paper nitrous oxides and ozone and all that . 
so , i believe them 
but i'm not a chemist . 
acid rain and some of the pollutants that come from , uh , industrial areas , factories and so on ? 
i don't really know , um , 
i grew up in los angeles and have felt like i was victimized by air pollution . 
i was going to say , 
so you understand smog .
and in fact i was a private pilot there , 
and i can remember and really being unbelieving at ,
it just looked liked peanut butter . 
my word . 
thick and brown and so on . 
and that was , a few years ago ? 
this was in the nineteen sixties . 
i wonder if it's any better now .
people say that it is somewhat better . 
um , heard about the , uh , recent legislation in , uh , colorado , uh , against a power company , uh , that's actually on indian land , i believe , 
but , uh , it has been ruled against , uh , regarding air pollution because they think that it's causing terrible smog over the grand canyon .
so they , 
it was , uh , a landmark case because it's unusual to , um , 
i can , 
if it didn't comply and so on . 
so did it burn coal ? 
i don't know that , 
the information is one of those wire services kind of pieces of news , you know , 
so it's hard , 
i never did see the full story , 
so i don't know . 
but they said that it really caused so much smog over , uh , the grand canyon in the winter months that they couldn't do the , uh , piloting , uh , you know , the helicopter trips and that sort of thing .
i mean that's such a spectacle . 
it would be a shame to ruin it . 
uh , what do you think individuals could do , or society could do to alleviate this problem . 
uh , uh , i don't know whether we could do a whole lot as individuals . uh , maybe just take good care of our cars ,
apart from that , i don't know what we can do as individuals . 
what do you think we can do ? 
you think , it's more to society . 
well i guess i kind of agree there . 
i , uh , 
on an individual basis there isn't a lot we can do about a lot of things 
but if we are concerned about it then we certainly can , uh , force , uh , government , uh , that we elect to deal more seriously with it . 
and i do think that we have a responsibility there . 
i must admit i'm not always real politically active 
but i do think that , um , congress has backed down much too much on some of the air pollution standards . 
and it's brought the , 
they , uh , really listen to 
uh , you know , have really pushed , 
 they   , 
all those restrictions are really too hard , 
we can't quite make that go 
and they don't 
and then we still live with air pollution . 
um , so i suspect that that's one thing that as individuals , we can do , make our voices known , perhaps to our legislators . 
but , um , as a society , i think we can do more 
and that's probably how we ought to do it . uh , in order to be group responsible . 
i guess unless there's something economically justifiable about it . 
and in the case of air pollution , it simply might turn out at some point down the road , to be so costly to have to live with air pollution in terms of health problems ,
i suspect that there's going to have to be a lot of pressure , uh , come to bear on the companies that deal with it 
and probably the only way that can happen is for , um , governments to realize that they have to pay if companies don't . 
and , uh , i don't know how long that will take . 
people also have to realize they can't have their cake and eat it . 
so , if you don't want to burn coal for power ,
well we don't want that either . 
how about investing in the sun . 
well nobody wants to pay twentyfive cents a kilowatt hour , i don't think . 
uh , i probably wouldn't mind if it really came down to it . 
well it's just the same thing with uh , uh , the gasoline , 
now is a wonderful time to smack a fifty cent a gallon tax on gasoline ,
oh yes , 
and yet the government is not going to do that because people are too dependent 
and they don't want to pay for it . 
so instead , we spend billions of dollars going to war . 
uh , you know , wha , 
however , it might have had other causes . 
certainly oil was a big factor . 
oh certainly , 
um , and i think that's probably going to happen with such things as air pollution ,
do you have any air pollution in your area ? 
uh , once in a while we'll get some , uh , 
i think it kind of washes down uh , from your area linda .
oh no . 
that's what they , 
you're talking about middle states ,
but it's not very usual 
and certainly we don't have the eye stinging variety that you get in the big cities . 
we really don't have that either . 
i lived in this area for about twentyfive years and i think i can tell a difference in the comfort level , uh , particularly in the summer . uh , you know , when it gets hot ,
it seems to me that i'm more uncomfortable 
and , you know , my eyes sting more and so on and so on . 
so i suspect that it's an ever growing problem . 
well i suspect that we've probably covered everything that we need to here . 
i think ,
it was nice talking to you . 
and i enjoyed the conversation . 
so did i . 
bye , bye . 
well , my favorite , probably , all time t v show is star trek . 
and i would   it like that , 
i like the adventure of it .
and then i like the , 
they have a new one now . 
the star trek the next generation .
and i've always liked that show probably the very best . 
i think i've actually seen a number of star treks , one way or another over the years . uh , although i never watched it regularly . 
i'm certainly acquainted with the character 
and then i've seen some of the star trek movies . 
the movies are good too . 
and most of the shows i like are , are kind of along the same line because they're all adventure .
 uh , you know , instead of a cast 
but he's always going out and inventing new things out of scrap , and grabbing what he can and , you know , pieces of baling wire and a few tires and all of a sudden he's got a hang glider 
and  , 
i don't think i've even heard of that show . 
you haven't ? 
it's called mcgyver ? 
and what is he ? 
he's like a semigovernment type agent . who uh , works for the phoenix foundation , supposedly . 
and , uh , little bits and pieces of string and baling wire and turn them into fantastic different things . 
he took a car battery and some wire and two washers one time and made a welder . 
 so he does all kinds of strange things like that . 
oh , great . 
boeing ought to hire him and give him a junkyard ,
see what we can come up with . 
do you like the , uh , news shows , twenty twenty , sixty minutes , those kind of things ? 
well , uh , i used to watch sixty minutes as a matter of fact , 
uh , and i used to like the show very much . 
but , unfortunately i find getting rid of your t v set , you do throw out some of the baby ,
some of the 
and uh , i just decided i had to do that . i think , in part because it was easy for me to become addicted to it , 
i mean i could just sit mindlessly in front of a t v set for hours . 
and i just realized , i was sort of like an alcoholic , 
if i didn't get the booze out of the house , i was going to drink . 
i guess i haven't ever had any trouble with that . 
i have my favorite shows 
and i usually make time in my day or my week , you know , to watch those . 
but , for the most part , i have small kids and i try and keep it on just a minimum amount of time , really when they're up . 
because they're , 
i guess that falls    , 
and one of my other favorite shows is sesame street because of the kids . 
i like that real well . 
well , when my kids were little , i did have a t v set 
and i did watch a lot of sesame street and a lot of electric company , as well . 
i don't think they have that on anymore . 
well that would be a shame . 
i haven't seen the electric company in a long time . 
 you know , catching it on p b s , 
but , uh , i don't think they show , 
it must be in , 
maybe it's in , 
if it was in repeats , 
but they're not making new ones . 
i haven't seen it in a long time . 
but sesame street is still really good . 
how about mister rogers , 
is he still around ? 
i don't think he's making new ones , 
but they repeat all the old ones . 
i see . 
so that's still a real good show too . 
that one tends to come on earlier in the day than i want to turn the t v on .
sesame street comes on from like nine to ten , which is a good time 
and everybody is up and had breakfast and dressed and ready to go , 
so it's 
the timing of it is good , besides  the amo ,  what's on . 
i figure your children are preschool ? 
so they like that . 
i seem to remember those shows being on in the afternoon . 
they come on both . 
they come on like from nine to ten and then from , uh , five to six . 
they just repeat 
another thing that's good about it , 
when it comes on right in the dinner hour . i can feel like i can let them sit in front of the t v and watch , 
and they're watching something worthwhile , while i can make dinner and do things i need to do 
with little kids the t v set really is a , i mean 
i used it as a pacifier . 
i'm not sure it was that great for my children , 
but they turned out okay , 
uh , it didn't hurt them any . 
some shows are good for , 
i think some , 
star trek , i , 
for the imagination of it all . 
the idea , i think that's one of the things i like about star trek . 
and is the , 
even in for kids watching some of it can be a little violent sometimes and stuff . 
i don't let my little ones watch it , 
but the imagination of , look what we can do , you know , in the future , perhaps , this will be possible .
well , i think we've covered most of my favorite t v shows . 
well , i'm trying to think if i ever even had a favorite one at one time , uh . 
let's see , how about , uh , man from uncle ? 
i do seem to reme , 
that's mission impossible . 
uh , mission , 
that's right , 
mission impossible . 
i used to watch that . 
in fact , i can still remember a couple of those . 
they were , 
i thought those were very good . 
they always have , 
i've seen some of them on repeats . 
that uh , 
they always had a good plot . 
it kind of kept you guessing on , uh , what was going to happen next .
how they're going get out of their latest scrape . 
i do remember that . 
and , uh , i remember as a kid my parents watching the ed sullivan show . 
that was really the big deal in our household , was the ed sullivan show . 
 oh , yeah , 
every saturday night ? 
and i went to see the movie the doors a couple of days ago , 
and they had this scene , uh , portraying the doors' appearance on the ed sullivan show . 
they even had somebody portraying ed sullivan , 
and it was very , very funny . 
i think it was the funniest part of that movie . 
well , i don't know , 
was there any , 
i remember the milton berle show even , 
i was , 
i'm not old enough to recall that one .
well i guess , i have to admit that i am .
my t v viewing started sort of midsixties , 
i see . 
my folks , 
i'm not even sure if we had one when i was really little . 
that may be why , bu , 
they probably didn't have a t v until i got to be , you know , grade school or so . 
and the shows that i like now , they wouldn't let me watch . 
i had to catch them all on repeats . 
like star trek , they thought that was much too violent for small children . 
so  , 
i ended up watching a lot of these things on , you know , repeats in the afternoons or something . 
that's interesting . 
uh , i think it's interesting that parents think that their small children learn violence from tv , 
people were just as violent before t v was invented , maybe even more so . 
but i guess that's a different topic 
isn't it ? .
well , i think uh , that's about covered it for me , 
so i think i'll say goodbye 
and we'll talk another time perhaps .
well , it was nice talking to you . 
tell me where you're calling from . 
i'm calling from garland , texas . 
garland , texas . 
all right . 
i'm in nor , 
where are you from ? 
i'm in raleigh , north carolina . 
oh , my goodness . 
i didn't know they did it long distance . 
or i hope they're trying to do it all over the country , because they need to collect all kinds of different 
well , it was nice talking to you .
same here . 
uh , the last movie that i saw , 
i don't go to that many 
so i'll just have to talk about the ones that i went to see , 
have you seen it . 
i heard it's really good , 
it is . 
i just have to take my hat off to peter deniro . 
he is one of the best actors i've ever seen . 
there's a point where , 
uh , the show is about these , uh , catatonic type people that , 
this doctor discovers a drug that brings them back to the living , more or less , 
but it wears off . 
and the way it wears off is he goes through all these spastic , you know , uh , 
it starts off with like a tic , 
and then it gets to where he can't , you know , control his movements at all . 
and it was just so realistic . 
the way , you know , you have to just keep reminding yourself that he's an actor . 
what does , uh , 
robin williams , does he have a funny part in it ? 
he's good , 
he's talented , 
i've only seen him in funny stuff 
and so . 
i know , 
me too . 
but , uh , well , what was that show , um , uh , garf , 
i want to say garfield 
but that wasn't it . 
uh , the world according to garp . 
the world according to garp . 
i didn't the movie , 
i read the book 
but i , 
i did too . 
that's why i was thinking it couldn't be just a totally funny part .
in fact , it got some pretty serious deep parts in it 
well what have you seen ? 
i think the last movie that we went out to see was dances with wolves . 
oh , i saw it . 
we've both seen one .
did you cry through it ? 
but each was about half an hour long , 
where did you cry . 
um , let's see , 
each time that i thought that the indians were going to get killed , i cried . 
um , i cried the first time when um , the wagon man got killed , when they attacked him . 
and , uh , i think from there on , all the way through the movie . 
let's see what else did it . um , what other parts . 
i can't remember any of the other parts right off now . 
i cried when the horse got killed and when the wolf got killed .
i don't remember when the horse got killed . 
oh , th , 
when he was riding back to the settlement and they shot his horse out from under him . 
oh , yeah . 
and then uh , the next day he looked out there and saw those buzzards , you know .
and that horse has been such a pal to him ,
you can tell i'm an animal lover , 
you can hear my dog .
unfortunately we don't have any animals , 
so , uh . 
it was a beautiful story , 
it really was . 
there was a lot of pretty scenery , too , in that movie . 
what did you think about the buffalo scenes . 
oh , i thought it was awful ,
that was , 
i mean i hadn't even imagined it , you know . 
i think we all heard the story of the slaughter of the buffalo . 
um , i had a friend who had fixed some , uh , about a week before went to see the movie . 
oh , oh . 
of course they raise them now , you know , to eat . 
it's not , 
but we were both feeling so guilty about enjoying this chili after seeing that . 
well at least you know that it wasn't same situation that the buffalo died in . 
it wasn't .
um , i thought the scenes when the buffalos running , though , were beautiful , 
like that was great . 
oh , yeah . 
and there were so many of them . 
i didn't know that , that many buffaloes alive , much less in one place . 
so that was pretty . 
and to think about how it just changed the whole landscape , you know , you could follow this beaten down path , 
and it sounded like thunder and earthquakes and that sort of thing . 
i wonder how they kept up with them , though , 
it seemed like the buffaloes were moving so fast . 
i know . 
i guess they graze , though , 
that wouldn't  be a  problem . 
uh , have you seen any of the behind the scenes , uh , of that movie . 
it was , 
they tried to keep it , you know , as very close to real . 
i mean like kevin costner did all of his own scenes 
and , uh , they had to teach a wolf how to howl . 
that's the , part they had trouble finding was wolves .
i guess they're just not domesticated , 
they just don't howl that much anymore . 
i could bring them in with my dogs and set a siren off 
and that's all they'd have to do .
well that's funny . 
well , i think we've made it . 
oh is that five minutes , 
is that , 
i don't know , 
is it five or three . 
okay , oh , 
i'm not sure . 
i'm not either . 
well i think we've done okay , though . 
me too . 
well thank you for calling . 
and i hope you enjoy some more good movies late , 
you too . 
bye , bye . 
i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute . 
it is .
it's one we all hold dear and near , i'm sure . 
oh , yes , 
i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them . 
most of mine's been pretty good , although i guess i'm like a lot of other people , now , 
i'm trying to pay off my credit cards 
 and , uh , i've done pretty good at it . 
well , i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want .
there is a big difference .
but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline . 
i do that , 
but to pay off 
it's too easy to run into the gas station . 
oh , it sure is 
and ,   .
at least that's for me . 
but yeah , 
i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience 
and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet , not bad . 
well that's , 
you know , i'm just shocked at the end of the month ,
but  ,
well , i've been pretty lucky in that respect . 
to not charge except for emergencies . 
but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards . 
there's , you know , 
they have , uh , wonderful features , 
they're there when you need them .
and then they have bad drawbacks , too .
it's awfully easy . 
it's like paying twice . 
that's true , 
so ,   .
i try to , 
i did switch to one , uh , sponsored by the credit union , though . that seems to be a pretty low interest .
oh , uhhuh . 
and you don't have an annual fee there , 
and that helps . 
oh , yes . 
uh , we used to have , you know , like several , 
but right now , we're just more or less at american express ,
and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in . 
that's one way to do it , because that forces you to pay for it 
pay fifteen , 
and  , 
i know , 
and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time . 
takes a long time , 
that's right . 
it sure does . 
and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off your income tax 
of course it's been going down for a number of years , 
but this is the last year you can take anything . 
well , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
and maybe we'll get to talk again . 
well , i can tell you pretty much my two favorite shows 
 and they kind of are in different spectrums , i think . um , 
one of them is quantum leap 
 and the other one is night court . 
and i think they're real different , i mean , 
i don't think they have anything in common , 
um , i mean quantum leap is kind of a comedy in its own way , i guess , 
but , uh , mostly it's kind of science fiction , 
and , um , it's adventure and things like that 
 and then night court is just pure , you know , weird fun , you know , 
it's nothing serious about it at all . 
so , i don't know why the two of them happen ,
but that's the way it is , 
it's funny that those are my husband's two favorite shows , too , 
and i enjoy watching both of them , 
but i used to didn't like night court 
 and i , 
and the only reason i think i like it now is because i've seen it so much 
and i'm involved with the characters , 
he is .
and i told my husband , that's the whole point , 
that's right , 
i mean , 
i just , 
i find him degrading at times . 
i guess that is the point , 
but sometimes it just , 
well , they really have changed him though . 
i mean , he still is in his own way degrading and everything , 
but , uh , he's involved in that charity , 
and , uh , it's taking up so much of his time and so much of his thought , that he really has , 
in fact , there was one show that he even turned down a date with some , you know , beautiful woman just because the idea that his mind was on the ozone layer 
and he , you know , was too depressed , you know , to , 
so that was part of , i guess , his character building or whatever , 
i think it probably adds a little bit of depth to his character . 
i haven't watched , um 
which of course he needed .
i think so , 
which in quantum leap you get 
even though the person is involved in so many other people's lives , you still see a real person in those situations . 
um , he's doing amazing things 
 but he's doing them within the bounds of what a normal person would do 
that's a good point , 
 and i think that's , 
i like that . 
so what do you consider your favorite shows ? 
um , i think my favorite show is hunter . 
and , series better when , um 
i agree . 
 uh , uh , and then the blond that they took out , the one that got killed 
i can't remember what her name is , 
but is , 
i didn't enjoy her . 
she was too much of a opposite of dede , 
and i think that's what they try to do , 
but i think we wanted to see dede there 
well , but , see i read an article you know , his three girls , whatever you want to call them 
 and they say that , uh , that there was like a conflict between her and him , uh , that they never really could get her into , uh , any character that they could use . 
i mean , you know , uh 
the second lady ? 
 you know , if you think about it , they didn't really interact hardly at all 
they didn't . 
 i mean , they were never partners . 
she would go her way , 
and i think that's what i didn't like . 
would go this , 
but , uh , it seemed like it was almost two different organizations 
like hunter was the boss , 
and this other girl was not , 
and , you know , you're wondering , you know , well when did this happen ? 
so , yeah , 
i kind of agree with that . 
and i like the new lady better , 
but i'd just as soon that they didn't have the romance there . 
i'd just as soon have the police story without all the romance . 
well , i'm afraid that's what they really wanted to do , um , 
i think most shows were doing that , 
and then they went away from it 
 and now they're starting to go back to it , 
and maybe that's what the public wants , 
i don't know , 
but the cut and dry solve the mystery , 
and that's what i always enjoyed about it . 
well , see , there was that spark between dede and hunter for a while 
 but they like started it , 
and then they'd pull it back , 
and they'd start it and pull it back . 
and that really made it a very interesting , uh , show to where you never really knew which one was going to show up . you know , whether it was going to , where they're going to be real close or whether they're just going to be partners , you know 
 and , that i kind of thought was good , 
but , um , you know , it's , i guess , you know , 
you always kind of sit there 
and you see these two people together , 
and you always wonder , why they don't , you know , get together 
and so i guess that's what they decide to do 
just go ahead and 
but that the two main stars get married , that the show ends up , you know , dying . 
 you know , this is probabl , 
maybe it's not a good example . 
i've been watching nickelodeon all last week , because they had what they called maximum smart . 
they had get smart for , uh , ten hours a day , from seven o'clock at night , until six or until five o'clock the next morning .
well , the last day , all they did was the last season , to where the two of them got married 
 and i mean , that was the killer , 
the series died right after that ,
i didn't , 
well go ahead . 
but i heard that's what killed it 
same thing . 
that , uh , interplay died when they got married , 
and so the show died . 
it seems like you can do so much more of the subtle hints and the subtle little plays on things before they get married 
the minute they get married , everything's supposed to be cut and dried 
halfway through , 
um , couple of examples would be , um , well , like i said , this one about or get well smart , the female character , barbara feldon 
she had been at the beginning and figured out and kept max from getting real messed up . 
well , in short , whenever they got married , she got dingy . 
you know , why would they do that ? 
it made no sense . 
i'm guess it's falling back into our traditional stereotype which a lot of shows 
unfortunately , that's probably true . 
which kind of , 
like in the big soap opera shows , which i don't enjoy because of that , 
well , do you you watch , um , what is that show , who's the boss ? 
uh , that's on tuesday nights i think . 
i've seen it before , 
but i don't watch it regularly . 
well , i 
usually tuesday nights i'm out , 
but , they started to let them get together , 
and then they pulled them apart 
 and i think they're thinking about that exact thing , about the idea that if the show lets them , uh , get together , then you lose part of what the show's all about . 
so . i always thought that was kind of weird . 
it's funny how we romanticize people 
 like , for instance , where as the teenager , you know , you romanticize a rock star , 
but when he gets married , then you don't care any more 
um , right . 
and i think it's the same with your characters on t v . 
do you think that's why most rock stars nowadays keep their marriages secret , or at least they keep it quiet . 
i mean , 
i know it affected me when i was younger . 
i'm not into rock stars 
but  , 
like madonna and sean penn . 
now i don't particularly like either one of them 
 but , um , uh , their marriage was so highly publicized that there was no way that they could stay together 
 or at least , that's the way i look at it . 
so i don't know , 
it would have been hard , 
i just , the publicity in and of itself , much less the , i mean , 
when you get married you've got relationship to develop in the first place , 
so , having twenty million people watch you do that .
they wouldn't be easy . 
so , um , well that's kind of interesting . 
it's been good talking to you . 
it has been , becky , 
i really appreciate it . 
well , i think i've , um , 
it's kind of nice .
okay  , 
well , thanks so much . 
well like i was saying , burlington's crime , it doesn't involve children 
and , what you see on the t v s you know , in washington and new york . 
so what i believe the people want , 
but i have , you know , concerns , 
i mean , i don't think , ideally , you know , you need money to do everything 
that's crime that you can't fight it if you need that money . 
well , when , uh , we lived in san antonio , 
i grew up around san antonio , 
and it's always been a very large , uh , city , and increasingly growing . 
it's has kind of the split population . 
um , there's a lot of retired military , uh , individuals that live there , 
and then there's a very large hispanic population there . 
and the one thing that we noticed that over the years has gotten worse and worse is hispanic , uh , gang crime in the city 
 and that has , uh , been the worse thing that we've seen happening . 
does it spread out of the neighborhoods into the , uh , retired people's community , 
or does it stay in the bad neighborhoods ? 
um , the majority of the actual gang crimes , like the drive by shootings and stuff stays in the neighborhoods , 
but the crime spreads out into the more affluent divisions through robberies , rape and , uh , car crime . 
there's a uh , or very high percentage of car theft . 
and san antonio's not far from the border to mexico , 
so a lot of the , uh , cars go to , uh , you know ,   shops , 
and they take them apart , 
and a lot of them go over the border , especially like mercedes . 
a lot of uh , the z cars , the datsun cars end up over the border , 
and uh 
so that's a big concern if you live there ,
in fact , for a while there they had downtown if you were to come to a stop light , they had a rash of when people were stopped at stop signs that people would get in their car and hold a knife and hold them up . 
so now , ever since then , when you drive into the city , most people keep their doors locked while they're in the car , until they get down there , 
and once you've reached um , you know , or alone . 
if you stay with the groups and along the area where they have the river patrol cops , it's very nice . 
but they have the high tourist area , the river walk area , which is nice , 
but you don't want to get off the beaten track . 
um , there's a lot of parking garages there because parking is very tight . 
and so you don't want to get caught in the parking garage , uh , alone . 
oh , my , it sounds like , um , san juan , puerto rico , 
we were there just , well for a lay over 
 and , um , well , it wasn't a lay over , 
we were staying at the other end of the island , 
and we drove into san juan to catch our plane . 
it was at night , 
and this boy really wanted to go on the beach , 
and they look at you crazy 
you don't go on the beach . 
 well , it's a big tourist town , you know , 
don't people go for a walk on the beach at night ? 
it's very safe in the daytime 
 but at night , they even have the policemen come around at dusk and sound their sirens , pretty much telling people , be wary , you know , and get off the beach . 
it's just so sad , you know , 
it is just really so sad because you can't enjoy anything any more . 
um , in san antonio i don't know what the answer is . 
education , i think , is a lot of it . 
um , so many of the kids are drop outs . 
um , uh , there's a lot of drugs that go on , and that they just have hopeless lives . 
they lead themselves down hopeless tunnels . 
i think education helps a little bit there . 
um , then again , i don't know really what steps there are that they , 
well , what they say they try to do is to get the kids , um , early and young . 
and what we have here in burlington , which it doesn't cost a lot of money , but they have a kids council 
they set up kids with elderly people , in the winter time they shovel their snow . 
they have a big brother , big sister program . 
they have bottle drives , 
they have cleanup outings . 
and they have also organized fun activities like gyms , going to the beach , and playing volleyball at the beach in the summer , 
and they have gyms open . 
and it seems that the younger you can get them and get them involved with programs 
 but you know , tell him , hey stay in school , 
it'll get better , you know , 
so that your mom doesn't have a job 
 and she doesn't work , 
you don't know , 
you can be better than that . 
you don't have to live you know , for a street life . 
that's good , that sounds like they've got a lot going on there . 
but it's so cheap they don't have a problem here . 
i mean , um , they can deal with that 
they might have five hundred troubled youths . 
when you have five thousand troubled youths , plus when you're getting into well , the kids now , it's twelve years old 
and they're selling drugs 
 and they've got a fifteen year old that's their boss 
everybody's responsible for the society , 
but , if i had a child that did things so bad , 
it's not , they don't care about anybody 
these people they're stealing from , they're just the big bad rich guy 
 and we don't have it , 
so we deserve it , 
and we should take it . 
i don't know how you combat that . 
with a lot of these kids , 
um , so many of them , all they see is just the gangs 
 and unless you can take them out of the environment enough to where they don't have the peer pressure from the gangs as soon as they come home from school . 
well , i think a lot of it is the parents are totally irresponsible , too . 
we're talking 
oh yeah . 
the parents might be thirty years old 
 and i'm thirty years old , 
and i'm kind of irresponsible , 
but i have the morals that keep me from , you know , 
if i was going to go out and drink or do something , i wouldn't do it in front of my child . 
these people , you know , they bring their johns home 
and they bring their drugs home 
and the kids are just sitting there in the same room . 
it's just that they have absolutely no morals 
 and it's really sad . 
and i don't know how you combat that . 
i rea , 
i don't know what the answer is to that problem , you know . 
but i like your idea of education 
uhhuh  , 
 i mean if the parents aren't supplying it , they've got to get it 
and what do those kids do , 
they get it at school and come home , 
what do they do then . 
i feel for them , 
i don't know how to make it better for them 
or , you know , because they can't remove themselves , 
they can't just leave and say okay , well , it's not acceptable , 
i'm leaving the big city , mom , 
and i'm going off , you know , 
when they're ten , they have to live in it , 
it's really sad , 
like if they did have a big brother , big sister program 
those people trying to help the kids , 
i think so , 
and uh , 
and i'm not good enough to raise my child , which basically is true 
i'm glad i don't live in a big city 
it's just because that i would be reminded every day 
and i might see it on you know , a sixty minutes special . 
in san antonio it was like every day , 
it was just a matter of who was shot that night , 
i know it 
but san antonio is considered a nice clean city , believe it or not .
i mean , they have all kinds of nice write ups about it 
oh , yeah , 
 but any big city has a bad section . 
it's very prevalent , 
a lot of the crime is very prevalent . 
they're very bold it seems . 
very much . 
when we moved here to monterrey it was a big change , because it's such a small community , 
we're just above carmel , 
and , um , there's hardly , 
most everybody seems pretty well employed around here , 
and um , those that aren't , 
there's celinas which is about a fifteen minute drive , which is mostly migrant workers , 
and there's a lot of crime there , um , migrant hispanic farm workers , people that are down and out , 
and uh , they all seem to congregate in celinas , not so much here in monterrey . 
so , it's pretty quiet . you know , 
we walk the streets at night , 
and , uh , people run in the park , 
and you know , you're just , 
have your normal smarts about you , then you really don't have to worry , 
uh , even in the worst crime areas in burlington , 
i can walk the streets . 
i wouldn't , 
if i did it every night 
so you wouldn't get confronted or anything 
 but i don't think you would , uh , 
someone might grab you , mess around with you , 
but they're not going to grab you , steal your money and slit your throat 
 i mean that's what your going to have to expect that to happen . 
people are just totally unfeeling . 
uhhuh , uh , 
i didn't know that about burlington , 
let's see , 
i believe in the trial by jury . 
i think if it was up to the judge alone that there would be real possible for , uh , payoffs , you know , briberies , uh , unfairness , onesidedness , you know , all those kinds of things . 
and i also like the unanimous decision because you have to persuade everybody to be a hundred percent , absolutely sure before you convict somebody . 
i really agree with the , uh , innocent until proven guilty theory . 
i think that's a good way to do it . 
that's about all . 
well , i think basically in a lot of agreement , uh , in that i certainly agree that for any case involving serious injury to another person then maybe that needs , uh , some kind of legal definition . 
but for anything involving that , trial by jury certainly should be mandatory . 
but there should be with our overworked , uh , judicial system , 
it seems to me like there ought to be a means of , um , not having to take everything before a full court . you know , 
maybe there ought to be some kind of , uh ,   
isn't there a type of word called a jury duty now . 
and maybe instead of , uh , just kind of blowing it off just spend a day or a day and a half like most folks do , maybe we should commit to spend a week , 
and during that week you're kind of an ad hoc , let's hear about it , group of , i don't know , twentyfive instead of twelve 
 and each case is presented to that group of twentyfive , 
and those cases are , uh , lesser degrees of magnitude . you know , 
the guy was caught burgling , 
and he had his pockets full of stuff , you know , when he was caught 
 you know , that kind of stuff you can just turn to the judge and say , your pleasure your honor , 
and there's not a lot of discussion about that kind of thing . 
but the way our court system works , that guy is going to have to hang around in jail or out on bail or something like that for an extreme period of time . 
i just think our system is overworked , 
and we're starting to stretch the true meaning of right to a speedy trial . 
that's a good idea . 
maybe this pre group of people could decide , you know , uh , you know , where they could go from there . 
do they need a big lengthy twelve person jury 
or do they need a six person jury or , you know , those kinds of things 
and the degree you know , the seriousness of it , you know , 
is this open and shut , you know , like you were saying , 
or do you need somebody to go off for three months and try to figure out what really happened . you know , a jury like that . 
you know , we , 
they could be a good idea to , 
that could work . 
you know , kind of   off what we've been talking about here , uh , i believe that everyone is very quick to sue or to threaten to sue and that kind of stuff , 
you know , maybe , instead of being so quick to sue you , uh , if you have a disagreement with someone , instead of tying up court and time and that kind of stuff , maybe you , 
and if you want to , your lawyer or your opponent need to go face this group of twentyfive or a judge   like 
good idea . 
 and let either he or that group decide whether or not you have a real case . 
and you know , let's get rid of some of this harassment suing . 
that's a good idea . 
and if that doesn't work , then to go get somebody , you know , a little bit more wiser and older and take them with you and go to them , 
and if that doesn't work , to take it to the whole church . 
so that's right off that same kind of principle . 
you bet , 
and if , 
that's a good idea . 
that's true , 
but , uh , you know , that whole biblical concept like that's true in a lot of our , 
 um , you know , the way the whole judicial system and the government is based on that . 
it doesn't work on that , 
but it's based out of that . 
you know , that could work , 
i'd forgotten what that's called . 
there's a real name for that like the judean law , or something like that . 
um , what is that called ? 
the judeochristian ethic . 
well , that may be right . 
it's in there some place . 
i think we both know that we're talking about 
uh , and , too , the , 
uh , that's sort of the old testament version . 
i know , 
i did a sunday school lesson one time on the difference between the old testament and the new testament 
but that's a whole different subject . 
well , i think we have exhausted my pitifully small knowledge 
 mine , too . 
but it's been a pleasure talking with you . 
same here . 
what part of the country are you from ? 
 i'm living here in texas . 
oh , okay , 
in texas . 
i was just being curious . 
well , that's quite all right . 
well , i'm from the dallas area . 
well , so am i .
oh , okay , 
well , that's neat . 
in fact , i'm at work out at lewisville . 
oh , are you really ? 
well , i'll let you go . 
and it was nice talking to you . 
my pleasure . 
have a good day . 
you too . 
 well , it's wrong for a company to require drug testing for certain types of positions . 
for instance , jobs that require use of heavy machinery and things like that where there's , uh , endangerment to their own life and other people's lives . 
uh , i agree with that . 
people that are , uh , driving 
i definitely think they should be tested . 
and i'm not opposed to any testing . 
i mean because i know i certainly wouldn't want or you know , because he was on drugs while he was there . 
 uh  . . . 
well , how do you feel about , uh , companies drug testing prior to hiring ? 
oh , uh , i was tested , uh , within my company . 
i think it's kind of a push to , uh , weed out drugs in states 
because i don't know of any other countries that are doing this 
 and i feel like it's really just within the united states . 
uh , it's okay . 
i think your record should stand for itself . that , you know , if you've been tested at other companies and you've always come up negative or whatever , then i don't see what the big deal is that they have to go to all the expense 
and once you've established the fact that you're not a drug user and especially if your personality proves that you're not . i think they could , uh , save money by not doing that . you know , every time , 
say if you change jobs you wouldn't have to do it if you'd just been tested at your other work place . 
well , what about random testing , though . 
do you feel like that's an invasion of certain people's rights if not everyone is tested ? 
and that's probably my question is , how do you know it's done fairly . 
i don't know that you do . 
if it's random , then it's random 
 and that's not necessarily fair . 
well , they might tell you it's random . 
but then , you know , it's kind of like a lottery . 
somebody in their lifetime may win millions of dollars where another person doesn't win anything , and tries and tries and tries .
well , i know that , for instance , in the n c double a , they drug test 
and it's not random . 
oh , i see . 
how do they pick their people ? 
uh , well , i think all college players have to do an initial drug test at a certain point prior to the season 
 and from that point on , uh , the n c double a does have something to do with it , 
but it's almost discretionary on the coach's part of each individual institution to identify the ones that have the problem . 
oh , i see . 
so , do you  . . . 
 and the ones that test positive have to retest after a certain period of time . 
well , do you think that should be implemented in the work place . you know , as like a manager or supervisor thinks or has suspicion that someone is using drugs , 
do you think they should have the right to send them 
 but i think that might be a violation of someone's rights . 
if someone's having personal problems for some reason that's causing them to behave differently 
 and their manager assumes they have a drug problem 
 i mean if someone assumed that of me , i would be upset . 
a , uh  . . . 
it's an accusation , 
 and it's 
and then how would you feel afterwards when you came up negative and , you know , your supervisor has accused you of using drugs . 
i don't , 
from the janitors to the executive management . 
i agree with that . 
because i know personally myself , i've been in the same job for three years , 
it will be three years in august 
and i've already been drug tested three times . 
what type of job do you have ? 
well , i'm an environmental engineer 
 and i've been drug tested three times 
and i know many people that have never been tested in their lifetime 
and the company i work for is sixty thousand people , plus . 
so see for some reason , i've come up three times . 
that's pretty high statistics . 
well , operate any type of machinery that might 
well , that doesn't , 
i mean i  . . . 
it's a legal job , you know 
 so , see it's really strange . 
that is odd . 
i was drug tested , uh , not for the job i have now , but for the prior job , uh , 
but i know that the job i had before , that , well , 
the job i uh , uh , my , uh , medical record from my old company 
oh , uhhuh . 
 so i don't know if i wasn't drug tested based on that or because the man who hired me didn't request the drug test , because i know that my company does drug testing on occasion . 
well , before have the right or do they have the ability to say , hey , we've already drug tested her 
and she came up negative . 
well , no , 
they don't know that i don't use drugs . 
they just tested me once . 
but , i used to work for a power company , 
so it was very important that they make sure their employees , especially linemen 
and since i was just , you know , one of the office folk , i guess it wasn't as important to them that they test me regularly . 
but i know they test most of the service people fairly regularly 
and are they tested random ? 
all of them are tested 
they're  . . . 
it's a rotation . 
oh , okay . 
i see . 
but it , 
but again , it depends on what job you're in . 
the men that are out there fixing power lines are tested a lot 
and the men that drive the trucks 
 but see , they make that clear to them as they hire those guys 
oh , i see . 
and we'll test you every three months thereafter while you work here . 
so they know that . 
and that's  . . . 
it's made very clear upon hiring . 
well  . . . 
well , have we spent our at least five minutes ? 
i think so . 
seven twentyfive . 
nice speaking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
so what kind of car are you thinking about getting ? 
well , none at the moment .
well , when you decide to . 
i currently drive a ford taurus . 
and a new car , i will go with the taurus or something similar , uh , in that regard . 
so you like the ford ? 
i have had it for about two years now 
 and uh , it's everything it's supposed to be . 
uh , i haven't had a minute's trouble with it 
 and , uh , the only thing i have against it in that's it's a taurus , 
but even after two years , i still feel uncomfortable driving it , because i had a honda before that 
 and so it's a little bit larger . 
but that's the only difference that i see , really . 
but i would , 
at the moment it would be , uh , american , uh , personally , 
it's the , 
the car i had before this one was a thunderbird 
and , uh , i loved it , 
i really did . 
but , uh , um , i finally decided to go check out uh , what the , uh , foreign cars were . 
so i bought myself a nissan 
but even though i love the car i've got now , i think my next car will probably be american again 
i always have , up until now . 
i just for one time decided to go outside . 
well , my wife a honda 
and it's an excellent automobile .
i'm not a real car fan . 
so , i do not , uh , opt for , uh , something that would be , you know , expensive 
serviceable , something that i can use 
 uh , and i , 
and with the taurus , 
i have a taurus , uh , l x , 
and it's , you know , 
you're talking when you think about price , it's several thousand dollars lower than the comparable honda or nissan or something along those lines . 
and as i said , as far i'm concerned , it has been extremely , uh , uh , serviceable and everything i wanted . 
well , ford's done a real good job in the last , uh , say , ten years 
oh , i think so too . 
now , i , you know , 
in travel and renting automobiles 
i've driven , you know , chevrolet automobiles and dodge , 
and i , 
if it's chevrolet , i just will not touch it . 
uh , i had a chevrolet before i bought my taurus . 
i purchased a chevy , um , citation . 
oh , yeah , 
those were not good cars . 
and , uh , i was ready to get rid of it two months after i bought it , 
i shopped around , 
and if i had thought i , uh , wanted to pay the amount of money , i probably would have gone with , uh , uh , an accord 
uh , but it was just , 
uh , an auto shop , 
and he purchased one of the first sables that was , uh , manufactured for his wife , a sable station wagon , 
and he just absolutely swore by it . 
and it was upon his recommendation and so forth for , you know , comparably equipped , you know , with cruise control and air conditioning and a m f m radio , and all these other things 
 uh , it was just , 
there was no comparison . uh , 
the only thing that i find , you know , if i would have anything against it is that it still has that soft american ride . 
uh , not , uh , 
that's about the only thing i find , you know , disadvantageous to it . 
but , my criteria , is simply something that looks good , something that's serviceable , 
and you know , i drive around a lot , 
but , uh , and you know , it's very comfortable on the highway . 
i can drive for , you know , ten hours or so and not really be tired in any way . 
but those are my criteria , 
and i probably in another six months to a year or something will probably start looking around again , 
and if there's something out there that , uh , is comparable to what i have now , i'll go ahead and get it . 
you know , the only thing i'm looking ,
i just bought , you know , the nissan that i've got about , uh , say , nine months ago , 
i guess it was .
so the only thing that would get me to change cars right now would be if , 
see , at the moment i'm single , 
and if i were to get married and have a family that would have to have something to do with it . 
but , uh , i don't have any plans for probably another two , three years of even looking , you know . 
uh , cars are too expensive right now uh 
in our parking lots , uh , two or three days ago i saw one of the new honda sports cars . 
uh , i can't remember what the name is . 
it's the thirtyfive or forty thousand dollar one , whatever it is , 
and it resembled a mazaratti 
and it's an absolutely beautiful automobile 
but to pay that much money for an automobile , uh , is just , 
i can't conceive of doing that .
that's , uh , 
i went to uh , about two weeks ago , 
and , um , you know , of course they had the normal , the ford , the chevrolet , that stuff . 
but then you started looking at the , uh , uh , 
they had ferrari there , they had , uh , b m w and all these other kinds of cars . 
and ferrari didn't even let you near the car , 
i mean , they were , 
that's how expensive they were . 
and then you saw , uh , hundred thousand dollar cars , 
you saw eighty thousand dollar cars , 
and or paying more for a car than i would for a house , you know . 
that's true . well , 
that doesn't seem likely . 
the difference there between us is that i am not really crazy about driving . 
i never have been , since , you know , my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young 
so i've never really cared . 
now , what i was , you know , 
before i was married and before i went to graduate school , i used to do little sports car racing . 
it was never my own car 
it was always someone else's . 
and that sort of thing i enjoy , 
but to go out and drive , uh , never has really had any appeal to me 
so . ell i guess we've discussed that enough 
don't you think . 
so , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
well , you have a pleasant evening . 
you too . 
take care . 
so , uh , what do you think about it ? 
well , um , i guess um , the concern for the private , uh , the idea of ,
because i can't really see why anyone , um , who has nothing to hide would object . 
well , there is always uh , of , 
of course , that is certainly true , 
and see that bothers me . 
i'm very much for drug testing , 
uh , i really am . 
um , see , i have to take , uh , medication for kidney transplant . 
and i'm going to be taking that the rest of my life . 
now , you , 
i don't know how that's going to affect , uh , 
if you had to have a drug test ? 
i mean i haven't had one yet . 
um , t i , 
i work for texas instruments 
 you know , we do have the random drug testing 
but i've missed it so far . 
but i mean , in the back of my mind , it always bothers me . 
and what happens if they catch it , 
they think that you know , i'm on drugs 
and they send me this , 
checked out or whatever . 
but it seems to me that there are ways to accommodate that . um , 
i agree that some innocent person might be victimized ,
but i would think um , that some guidelines could be set up to avoid that . 
for example , that one , uh , positive would not be , uh , accepted as an automatic , um , reason for whatever they might be going ,
because , um , with , uh , false positives for certain kind of drugs . 
on the other hand , um , i think there's certainly some professions that ought to be tested 
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah . 
but , um , in uh , you know , himself and his own family , perhaps , um , depending on the kind of drug he might be on . 
but , um , and eventually that's going to show up anyway in the way he works ,
but there's so many things that it would make a difference . 
i guess a bus driver or a train engineer or something like that , who , um , you know , hadn't been tested . 
well , i'm very much pro testing , um , 
and this is why . 
uh , number one is i'm kind of , 
i know this sounds like a slogan for the government , 
but you know , we are in a war against ,
i mean 
i mean , you don't know whether the person sitting next to you 
and it takes some drastic steps at this point . 
and i think , personally , the drastic step has to be um , that you can't work if you continue taking drugs . 
i mean , it's as simple as that . 
i mean , make it so , 
make it difficult enough . 
but make it so that it's not glamorous . 
i mean , it's glamorous taking drugs , 
or at least it seems that way . 
according to what you , 
the people who , um , have serious problems , i mean , 
we have , um , 
really i guess we're kind of lucky . 
we really only know of one , uh , young man uh , who's a fam , 
they go to our church , 
and it's the son and so on , 
and he was friends with my children um , 
and he's really the only one that i know of personally who got himself really messed up , um , having been involved with drugs . 
but i know of a number of other people who have , you know , gotten all messed up . 
most of these are young people . 
i work in the education system 
and so i have a little more contact with that . 
but , um , the effect that it's had on this young man's life is so dramatic that it's heartbreaking 
 and he may never really be a productive member of society . 
but sadder than that , he may never be able to have a normal , happy life because it has strung him out so that he has anxieties now that are almost uncontrollable . 
i mean , he's not sure if he's going try to commit suicide or not . 
i mean , you know , he's so messed up . 
and , um , this was a nice , sweet , young man who , teenager , you know , 
and he's now a young man about twenty , i guess , who , um , just got really down the wrong path . 
and , uh , you know , i don't know that his problem would ever have been detected by drug testing . 
but seeing what drugs did to him makes me realize what it could do to people , you know , in the work force as well . 
um , it's horrible . 
well , then , 
well , the limits , uh , uh , would , i think , have to do with what i'd alluded to before , that one positive on a drug test ,
in other words , there needs to be , um , more than , 
treatment before for dismissal type thing . 
there needs to be more than one test , 
and there needs to be some measure of , uh , certainty before anything drastic happens . 
there are lots of things that are involved there , um , such as , perhaps , insurance 
and undoubtedly there are people who would be victimized by this , um , that , you know , 
it would be unfair , 
and people who are on medication , for example , or , um , even people who might be of the gay community , 
and i'm not an advocate for that particular segment of society , 
but , um , i think that there doesn't need to be fuel to the fire for discrimination 
because it makes a bigger problem . um , 
so it seems to me you know , some rules 
i'm not sure , though , when we talk about what rules , if any , that we should say , well , certain segments should not have to be tested . 
i really don't see why , 
personally , i think that's what i was about to say 
and , yeah . 
i don't , 
it , you know , 
and it may be , you know , 
it's not feasible to do everyone , 
but certainly random testing , the fact that people know that they , 
that it could happen . 
would be some measure of protection . 
but the bottom line is you're going to do that because you want to . 
well , there's going to be some measure of incentive , uh , reward or whatever , 
but the reward ultimately comes down to what you want . 
so i've got to agree with that . 
so , um , 
that's very true . 
well , it sounds like we agree , anyway . 
i think so . 
i think we did pretty good . 
well , all right , 
well , uh , i guess that's about it . 
i guess if that's all we've done 
and i guess we've talked long enough . 
all right . 
it was nice talking to you . 
all right , 
well , do you own a p c ? 
i have one at , uh , 
the company i work for furnishes , 
so i can work at home . 
oh , wow . 
and it's just an old compact , that is super slow 
it does its job , 
what processor does it have in it ? 
um , i don't know , 
it's so old . 
it's one of , 
oh what kind of work do you do on it ? 
um , i do , um , television ratings 
and i process some ratings and do graphics for their television stations ,
oh , okay . 
it's basically just data entry and running , you know , some software 
so it doesn't really have to be anything sophisticated , you know . 
huh , yeah , 
i don't own a p c 
but yeah , i work for t i 
and , uh , 
my husband does , too , 
well , i have , uh , a fairly fancy one , 
it's a t i model . 
it's an s p one thousand which , has a fast processor in it , a three eightysix . 
and i , 
the job that i do , 
i do a lot of training of our customers for new products . 
and i have to develop , uh , functional  specs   ,  disk  and  desk  top publishing and everything , 
so it's , 
i mean , i always say that i need to buy a computer for the house 
but i just haven't got around to doing it yet . 
oh , yeah , 
i'd like to have one for the house , too , 
i don't want to come home and have to work on one ,  too  .
your husband , what group is your husband in ? 
um , something with the defense . 
oh ,    ? 
defense systems and electronics group ? 
they've changed their name so many times i've lost track , 
i see . 
he works up in plano . 
oh , okay . 
i work on , uh , printers and ,
i work in the airline , marketing group . 
so , we do a lot of , 
i didn't even know they had anything like that . 
oh , yeah . 
there's so , 
i learned so many things that they do , 
they're into so many different things , 
i just kind of , 
  in for a while , you know , 
he had , uh , one of those , what are they , top secret things ,
but then he switched jobs . 
i don't understand half the stuff he does 
and , i have , uh , 
is he a programmer ? 
i see . 
software design engineer , as they call it , 
but i have a degree in information management ,
it's basically the , more the business end of it than the programming end of it , you know . 
but i've been at it for , you know , five years , 
so . everything's changed so much i probably couldn't even get a job right now . 
it seems like it's changed so much , 
so , you know , they've made such advances in computers , 
so , uh , does your husband ever use , uh , a laptop or a notebook ? 
does he bring a little one home with him 
but , uh , it quit working 
so brought it back 
and he just hasn't brought another one home . 
but they did give him a new computer at work , 
oh , i see . 
we build , uh , laptop and notebook computers here in temple also . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and those are really handy , 
i mean , they have modems in them , you can send a fax from your p c , 
oh , how nice , 
but they're really , 
he doesn't have one of those , 
what's that ? 
he doesn't have one of those . 
they're pretty handy because , you know , when i travel , it's easy to check messages , 
just , you know , 
well , my husband doesn't have to travel , 
oh , okay . 
i just found out i'm going to denver sunday night again . 
oh , boy . 
well at least you get to , 
so that kind of reeks havoc with plans , 
but , it's really not enough to become a big hassle . 
well , that's good . 
some people enjoy the travel 
but i don't think i'd like it , if  he traveled a lot  .
i see . 
i would love to have a computer , 
but they're so expensive . 
well , i don't know , 
there , you can get , well , 
depends on what you consider expensive , 
i mean , 
you can get real high powered stuff now for under two thousand dollars , where , you know , just a few years ago it would have been six , seven , eight , nine thousand dollars . 
yeah . you know , 
i guess you know , it's , inexpensive compared to what it used to be 
but it's a lot to put into one . 
it's still , i mean , 
you know , two thousand dollars isn't just pocket change to a lot of people .
that's right .
it's not . 
so it's major   .
maybe when the kids get in school that will be , you know , 
when they start needing something , you know , then that will be different 
when i started at , uh , t i , i was a summer development student ,
and so those papers really , 
i mean , it was nice having access to the ,
oh , yeah . 
i remember that . 
i had to do some of my husband's papers because i had access to one 
but , you know , his was more for scientific stuff than for word processing , you know , 
i did a lot of his papers . 
they come in real handy , 
that was a lifesaver . 
well , how many different types of packages do you use ? 
at home ? 
um , all i , 
the packages i don't really use , 
  what i use that   outside development that we use most of it's just stuff that's been written in  house  that i use . 
oh , okay . 
i've got , 
up at work anyway , i use wordperfect and lotus and , 
i know those two . 
i've just used wordperfect and lotus the most . 
you probably use   or something like that ,
a lot of the data entry stuff they used , uh , survey system and , um , you know , just inhouse programs to do what they needed . 
i work , 
do you work at home all the time 
or just , 
well , no , 
and they just wanted me to continue working for them at home doing other things , 
oh , that worked out pretty good then . 
it did . 
you know , a lot of what i used to do , 
i just do , you know , something really minor 
and it's time consuming . 
it gives me a paycheck , you know , 
the work's only , you know , three weeks . 
goes for like three to four weeks three times a year , 
you know , it's not something that's continual because , you know , the television ratings don't come out , you know , all the time . 
they only come out four times a year , 
so but . 
i tell you if i could bring a computer home and do stuff here , i'd get all kinds of stuff done . 
phone's always ringing 
i've got a lot of , 
especially right now , we've got several new products coming out , 
and i've got lots of documentation i need to review and some i need to revise . 
will they let you take a computer home to work ? 
well , yeah , 
oh , uhhuh . 
you know  , i've just got to deal , with all those other things that happen 
i bet . 
my hu , he took one home you know , they had a big deadline coming up 
and it was looking a little touchy to meet , 
well , i've done that before on , a couple times . 
but that would make it just that much easier 
instead of bringing home a computer , you just bring home a few floppy disks , you know . 
that's right . 
i thought that would be , you know , 
because it's real nice with this because i don't even have to go into the office 
i've maybe been into the office once in the past  three  years , you know . 
oh , my . 
um , they just send me everything and pick it up courier or whatever , 
so , you know . 
man that sounds really nice . 
it is real nice , you know , 
i just deal with them on the telephone , 
half the people don't even know who they're talking to . 
but i , you know , worked , 
i know most of them , well , 
i can't say that , 
a lot of people changed around there 
but , most people know who i am , 
but i don't know who they are , you know . 
a lot of them just know me by name and phone voice . 
i've got a lot of folks that i've worked with like that as well . 
you just know them by the telephone , 
so . but , well , it's been good talking to you , 
we tried . 
it's hard to sometimes . 
well , we'll talk to you later . 
okay , well , thanks , 
bye , bye . 
okay , um , 
do you like to cook ? 
i love it . 
i do too . 
it's kind of hard to find time sometimes 
do you work ? 
and have a family ? 
but i usually work about fifty hours a week 
i expect so . 
uh , well for a dinner party , i think one of my favorite things is baked chicken and white wine . 
is a chicken in a marsala wine sauce , 
 so . here did you get your recipe for it ? 
um , i guess mostly out of an international cookbook that i have . 
oh , okay . 
well mine actually came from the , um , texas instruments cafeteria . 
they have a t i plant in texas , in kingsport ? 
we have , 
it's in johnson city . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , um , the cafeteria is real good about putting out recipes , you know , like once a month , 
they'll put out a recipe of the month . 
and they put this one out 
and i tried it 
and it was really good . 
what uh , is a marsala wine a sweeter wine ? 
and it's a red wine . 
and , uh , i'm trying to think what else . 
i roll it in bread crumbs and , uh , parmesan cheese , 
and , then i rub the chicken with a little bit of oil ,
oh , so it kind of browns 
and then you put wine over it . 
that sounds real good . 
and , it's really easy too 
what do you use    ? 
what do you serve with it ? 
i like to serve , um , a wild rice with it . 
that's what i do too .
 this is really neat . 
and , i , 
we're big broccoli fans . 
that's what i've got . 
 well , i just don't think you can go wrong with something like that . 
it's great . 
i've got a good dessert recipe . 
oh , what ? 
uh , do you like angel food cake ? 
i just break it up in a glass bowl , 
and then i mix up , uh , some cream cheese and a little bit of amaretta wi , and some cool whip , 
and i make a thickened blueberry sauce 
and i layer it with , uh , angel food cake and the blueberries and then that topping . 
what time should we be there ? .
that sounds wonderful .
it's great . 
i love desserts , 
but since there's only two of us ,
i try to avoid making anything that , too fancy , that ,
i know what you mean . 
we don't eat desserts much any more . 
but that i really like , that i haven't made in awhile , 
and it's called a fruit pizza . 
and you take a , uh , sugar cookie , uh , recipe ,
so you make it like a pizza crust , 
and then you bake that 
and then you , um , take things like kiwi ,
and um , excuse me , you use cream cheese and a little bit of orange juice 
and i can't remember what else is in it 
and you make kind of a glaze , 
and then you layer your fresh fruit on that . 
oh , and pour that over it ? 
that sounds great . 
it is really good , 
and it , 
it would be pretty . 
and it , 
depending on the fruit you use you know , it's real colorful . 
especially with like the kiwi and the strawberries . 
that would be pretty . 
but usually i just opt for brownies and vanilla ice cream .
we've been fixing something lately that , well 
we've been cooking a lot of ,
it's just so much better for you . 
and i've been making a hot sandwich . 
i toast a piece of whole wheat bread ,
and then i make a little honey mustard dressing and put over it ,
that sounds great . 
it is delicious . 
i wouldn't mind serving that to anybody . 
and doesn't take a long time to fix , 
it's really good , 
and it's really good for you . 
it's real quick . 
and we eat out a lot 
and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out , 
and i wish i had something a little bit different ,
well ma , 
mix up a little , uh , mayonnaise with some dijon mustard ,
i mix it until it just tastes good to me . 
i was going to say , do you just mix it to taste ? 
and it's real good . 
and it keeps in the refrigerator . 
how long , does it keep , 
do you , well 
you wouldn't have to make , 
 oh , it keeps a long time . 
and you wouldn't have to mix that much together even . 
it keeps a long time . 
i'm sorry i keep coughing . 
i've had a bad cold . 
and i put a little , um , oh , yogurt in it too . 
plain ? 
plain yogurt ? 
if i , 
it gives it a little tang . 
i'll bet that is really good . 
it makes a great sandwich . 
i'm going to have to think of that . 
we're getting company tonight , 
oh ,  are you  .
and i have been debating what to cook because one of my guests is a vegetarian . 
oh , yeah , 
that's kind of hard . 
so , we're going to , 
i think we'll try to do something a little bit , 
we might try um , to grill some flounder or salmon steaks . 
they'll eat fish ? 
she'll eat fish . 
and , i usually , 
when they come down i'll grill those 
and , um , definitely go with , it will have to be a rice dish 
that sounds good . 
i had a recipe from that , um , international cookbook two , that's a great salad in summertime . 
do you garden or not ? 
our next door neighbors do 
and a lot of times they'll give us something . 
  it's just sliced tomatoes 
and i put it on a glass plate because it looks real pretty .
and everybody loves it 
and it's so easy , 
and it's delicious . 
that's what i was just thinking , 
it doesn't sound like it would be hard at all . 
it isn't . 
where did you get , 
 and you can put some cucumber slices on too . 
where did you get this cook book ? 
i got it at the checkbook store . 
and , it's got all these beautiful pictures ,
it's going to say , uh , edited by charlotte turgeon , editor of , 
i'm not french ,  laroute ,
the creative cooking course . 
i'll might have to visit the state book store . 
i'm trying to see who it's published by , ottenheimer , 
i've never heard of it . 
i haven't either . 
this edition is published by bonanza books . 
it's a big book 
but it was not expensive . 
well , the ones that i've been wanting to get , um , 
i guess you've seen the three hundred sixtyfive ways to cook chicken ,
i've been wanting to get those because we eat a lot of chicken , 
and we do eat a lot of pasta . 
so , to do without red meat . 
that's right . 
i don't think it would . 
you know , we don't have that much of it now . 
as long as we have plenty of vegetables ,
i stir fried some the other night though . 
some , uh , beef and broccoli strips , 
it was good , 
but it didn't have much beef in it .
i've got a wok that we don't use near as often as we used to . 
we used to stir fry a lot , especially , um , a lot of chicken and a lot of rice dishes . 
it just takes the time to cut everything up . 
but usually if i take a day off or on the weekend especially , i try to cook , 
and at least cook a couple of dishes ahead . 
so that we can have those to enjoy . 
one of my daughters sent me a colorado cook book , put out by the junior league of denver . 
have you ever seen any put out by junior leagues ? 
they are great . 
and we have a share alike column in the paper ,
and that's where i get a lot of my recipes . 
and i got a real good one from a doctor's office one time . 
oh , is that right , 
what was that ? .
uh , it's a baked bean recipe . 
and , you mix baked beans and lima beans 
and , uh , let's see , i guess , 
you buy the canned baked beans ? 
just mix the canned beans together ,
and you just bake it . 
and a spicier baked bean dish . 
oh , that sounds .
and , you can add hamburger if you want ,
that sounds good . 
so , find really good recipes where you wouldn't even think about it . 
so , i try to always keep a little notebook in my purse . 
jot them down , huh ? 
but , it's been , 
i guess we're on . 
well , hang on 
i don't know . 
so , in maryland uh , are you a skins fan ? 
i really wasn't from here 
so , uh , the teams i really root for in football are the niners and the seahawks , um , you know , mostly because , only the niners because i used to live out in california ,
and besides i like the city . 
oh , okay . 
so , you were out there in san francisco ? 
uh , yeah . 
oh , yeah ? 
it's , um , um , other than back a few year ago i like san francisco . 
oh , okay . 
but , uh , i don't know 
i never really was a cowboys fan until i moved down to texas . 
oh , is that where you are now ? 
oh , okay . 
i'm in dallas 
and , uh , uh , i guess when you're down here in dallas you finally get indoctrinated into the cowboys 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , uh , unfortunately , of course , the cowboys have been doing so bad in the past few years . 
that , uh , uh , 
i don't know , 
everybody's kind of , 
they're still behind them 
but , uh , it's not like it used to be . 
well , you know , you back the winners 
and you don't back them when they're not doing well .
that's right .
but i think , uh , actually , uh , um , a philosophy for , well i don't know , probably the last twentyfive years except for about the last about five or six years 
but they would go out and try to go for , uh , the best people and then mold them into different areas or find their natural niche . 
and then about four or five years ago , uh , they started going after , uh , uh , specific players or positions , you know , 
like the press would get down on landry , 
and this is when schramm was still there . 
so they'd go out and try to find a defensive end 
and when they drafted somebody and he didn't work out at that spot it really wasn't a good enough athlete to move to any place else . 
uh , so i think it was kind ever interesting . 
i think the decline the best athletes . 
it makes sense because , you know , you've got the flexibility if they're good athlete they can , you know , do a bunch of different things . 
 and i don't , you know , 
my main sport is baseball 
but , you know , um , i've been enjoying football 
but i don't know it as well . 
um , i just , you know , um , 
is it this year they don't have a draft pick because of the walker trade 
or what was the whole deal on that ? 
uh , they still have uh , some draft picks , uh , 
actually , they picked up some from minnesota . 
i think it was , uh , minnesota's    , 
oh , that's right , 
that's right . 
it went the other way . 
what was i thinking . 
they traded walker , 
my brain is really working well tonight . 
that's okay , 
they , um , um , 
i've got a friend that , uh , lives right next to the cowboys' training camp . 
and , uh , uh , he sees them out running a lot 
and every once in a while gets a chance to talk to some of the guys 
and they really got something going this year , 
but i guess , uh , when you have a whole bunch of , uh , professional athletes that get together at the beginning of the year everybody's got great hopes . 
spring training until you actually start going out and uh , getting out against the competition everything probably looks pretty good . 
oh , yeah . 
i mean , you know , if you go to , 
you know , i'm sure if you go to any of the twentyeight coaches in football in training camp they say , oh , we're going to be super bowl champs 
this is the way it is . 
well ,  kim   , i mean , didn't the cowboys even finish , 
i enjoyed that because it was against the skins . 
 well , uh , you don't like the skins ? 
um , no . 
and , um , .
oh , okay . 
and , um , i mean , i'm really , 
the expansion going on in baseball . 
d c is like talking about how they're going to get a baseball team and everything . 
it's like you guys aren't going to get a baseball team , i'm sorry it's not going to happen . 
but , of course , you know , uh , a baseball team then baltimore shouldn't get a football team . which is probably true , 
but anyway , um , i've never liked d c a whole lot 
and a really hate the redskins .
well , of course , 
oh , yeah . 
yeah , um , 
of course , then you're not that far from philadelphia . 
philadelphia , the city a whole lot . 
the only reason i really enjoy the eagles at all is because , uh , i really like randall cunningham . 
oh , okay . 
it was buddy ryan , the one that i can't , uh , uh , stand too much . 
well , considering how well he gets along with , uh , jimmy johnson that doesn't surprise me . 
really . oh . 
ther , in , 
the baltimore sun has this , uh , cartoonist in the sports section 
and , uh , when , uh , 
i guess it was january , when , um , jimmy johnson got named coach of the year or whatever . 
it was the same year that buddy ryan got fired . 
and , uh , he had this cartoon in there about jimmy johnson's big day , you know , 
the first thing is the phone call uh , um , you know , uh , was coach of the year 
and the second was this phone call from buddy ryan , i got fired can you believe that .
 uh , oh , jeez . 
yeah , uh , 
actually , uh , you said you lived near , uh , baltimore ? 
you're out , uh , 
i used to travel out that way a lot 
and , uh , actually i used to drive a lot between baltimore and washington 
i lived , 
do you know what ellicott city is ? 
um , no . 
oh , okay . 
but basical , well , route seventy and uh , route forty . 
i used to go out of b w i a lot . 
that's not far from where uh , the new football stadium would be if we got an n f l team .
oh , yeah ? 
well , they've built a new stadium downtown , um , 
it's opening next year . 
is that near the , what do they , 
i forgot the name of it . 
is it the , the wharf or the , uh 
it's , um , a couple of blocks west . 
um , there is an old railroad yard ,
there's a big long railroad shed 
and then there's , uh , an old station 
and they're building the stadium on the other side of the shed from the inner harbor , which is really stupid because one of the big selling points of the new stadium is supposed to be this view of the inner harbor 
and the only way you're going to have a view of is this big brick wall  , um , 
 but , you know , they're building the baseball stadium 
and they've got land set aside for a football stadium if they ever get a n f l team . 
so it's , um , real easy access um , like the airport or more importantly for the orioles from washington d c . 
the orioles say they get twentyfive percent of i mean , uh , their attendance from d c . 
i tell you what i , 
the colts you know , still to me are the baltimore colts . 
you know ? 
they really ought to change the name i think in indianapolis . 
i , uh , never been real thrilled with , well , not , you know , 
sitting here and talking about all the cities that i hate , 
uh , i went to purdue university for a couple of years and , uh , 
oh , okay . 
and , um , i was not real happy go there of all places .
so , uh , uh , you know , did you graduate from purdue ? 
delaware ? 
oh , there's not a whole lot in delaware . 
but it's close to philadelphia and baltimore , 
so it's , 
that's true . 
do you have any children ? 
you don't . 
do you ? 
did you ever have her in child care ? 
she was , um , at a private , well , 
i stayed off work with her for little over of a year 
and then i had her at a private sitter for , i guess , two , two and a half years after that . 
and how did you choose that sitter ? 
um , she was referred to me by a couple of people 
and she turned out to be wonderful . 
i couldn't have asked for anything better , i don't think . 
i didn't want to send her straight to a day care . 
and , even though she was that old , i still didn't want her to go to a day care . 
and this lady , you would think it was her own . 
she's real good . 
it's hard to find people like that . 
it is . 
and , um , now i have got her in a montessori school . 
and she's really , really doing good and learning a lot . 
 and , actually , i've started working up there in the afternoons , too . 
oh , yeah . 
well , that's neat . 
well , yeah . 
i guess . i'm going to quit as soon as the school season's over . 
but , uh , i really enjoyed being with her up there . 
i hate it for her , 
she has to stay that much longer , 
do they have classes for them during the summer , too ? 
 uh , yearround , uh 
now , in the summer they have like a lot of field trips . 
there's a field trip just about every day if they want to go on one , and stuff like that . 
it's a lot more lax . 
 but they still go through all their , uh , curriculum as usual . 
what kind of questions did you ask about the private sitter before you took her over there ? 
um , gosh .
i ca , 
my husband and i both went . 
we kind of give her the third degree .
uh , good  , 
i'm glad to hear that . 
well , we went over to her house , 
so we told her , you know , pro , 
well , we just told here we'd be over that day . 
we didn't tell her when . 
so , that way i didn't think , y , 
and , um , she had a daughter , 
and i want to say her daughter was like six or seven , right around first , second grade . 
 and , um , at the time she kept one other child , um , about a four year old , i believe . 
but it was only like a parttime basis . 
 so , we went over there 
and  ,
and , uh , we really seem to be pleased with her . 
and , um ,  , 
did you introduce your daughter to her before you made ,
oh , yes . 
and she literally spent almost the entire amount that i paid her on my daughter .
so , we're real , real lucky . 
but aft , uh , 
so she stayed with her about , roughly two years , 
and um , she had to go back to work , 
they had some other expenses that came up 
so she had to go , i guess , get a real job .
get a real job , full time . 
so , uh , 
so , what made you decide to put her in a montessori school ? 
well , i checked a lot of places out , you know , the kinder cares and the ,
and , uh , i live in garland . 
and , there's this montessori school that's nearby 
and , um , it had been recommended by some friends of ours 
but , uh , it's an older place . 
and so , i , uh , checked out all the new places that were near us 
and then i checked that place out 
and ,  uh ,  even though it was older , it was real comfortable and ,
and they didn't just play all day long . you know , 
like , i noticed a lot of these other schools that i went and or interviewed at , um , they did a lot of play work and stuff . 
and then they , 
almost all of them had a montessori section . 
and i thought , well , gosh , that must be pretty good , you know , if everybody's trying to incorporate a little bit of it into , 
and they made sure they pointed it out , you know . 
but after i looked at this place , and i took randi with me , uh , i think just about to every place . 
one place i think i didn't take her . 
and , i just kind of let her go , see what she felt like doing . 
and that place , boy , 
if somebody came and she liked them and she went outside with them it's hard to drag her away .
so , i felt more comfortable at ,
and she was real comfortable . 
and she has really done good . 
it's hard to tell how much has been that or how much is just her . 
but , she seems to me to be , you know , pretty quick and smart 
and she's already reading and writing and stuff ,
that's good . 
 and she just turned five last month . 
huh , that ,
i think so . 
i mean , i didn't want to rush school at her the whole time , 
especially we're going to spend the next eighteen years ,
i wanted ,
that's right . 
i just hate that , 
but , anyway . so , you don't have any children . 
do you have any nieces or nephews  then   ? 
i have a nephew . 
he's a little brat . 
he goes to a really crummy day school . 
my sister's not real bright , 
always sick . 
i mean , he has always got some kind of ,
i don't think this place is a very good place for him . 
it's just kind of convenient 
and she's the kind that goes for convenience over anything else . 
 oh , really . 
just easy to get them ,
well , that's a shame . 
i don't think she checks things out very well .
oh , really ? 
it is scary . 
i was petrified . 
i know . 
i would be , too .
i mean , that's , uh , 
i don't know , 
that's just it . 
and that's why i don't mind paying more . 
um , i don't know . 
i just feel m , 
too many horror stories out there that ,
and that's one reason i like working up there a little bit is ,
 oh , yeah . 
that's right . 
i think that's an ideal situation . 
because you don't know , uh , 
because like at her school , .
they sit 
and they have car callers 
and some kid goes out and gets the kid 
well , at first that always kind of bothered me . 
i mean , not bothered me , 
but i thought , well , you know , i'd like to see what she's doing , you ,
but now that i'm there , i mean , it's a lot more convenient because there's so many kids that doddle .
 and it's hard to get them out , 
and a lot of parents have places to go and 
that's right . 
and it's late at night , 
so , you know , now it doesn't bother me at all 
is that where the , 
over there off of , like , 
i'm not sure what the street is , 
is it near country club , 
 and all , 
that one that's ,
but i've never actually seen the place itself , you ,
it's set far back ,
it w , 
and that's something i like , too , 
that little kinder care , whatever it is ? 
you know , it's right there on , 
which this is on a highway , too . 
but it's set back ,
there's a difference . 
i would be scared to death my child might accidentally get out , 
that's right . 
you know , or a car accident . 
and it was brand new when i checked it out 
and , of course , it was beautiful and ,
i didn't base everything on that . 
because that all wears off . 
that's right . 
that's exactly right . 
you get some kids in there 
and it's ,
but , um , 
i'm scared to death her going to public school . 
i don't know , 
i , w , 
i do know why because 
i would be , too . 
and that scares me . 
i know . 
it is scary . 
i mean , you're just with them , 
do they teach them in school right now where she's at about drugs ? 
um , they've had police officers come in 
but , of course , they still have no concept of ,
and what to do when they're faced with it . 
but i just think of her , you know , 
next year she's going to be five , six years old in kindergarten , in same school with , you know , uh , i guess ten year olds . 
isn't that ,
and that's a big gap . 
it is . 
and uh , that , i can honestly see the peer pressure there . 
and that ,
 oh , i can , 
those kids getting snatched 
nothing wrong with that .
you do . 
i don't think there's anything wrong with that . 
so , i at first thought , you know , when i didn't have kids , 
but , it's easy now .
now you understand .
 that's exactly right 
and i do . 
but anyway . 
well , are you married  ? 
are y'all planning on having kids ? 
well , that's good . 
because they're really neat . 
it's just . 
both , 
are you a t i er ? 
are you at work right now ? 
so am i . 
in which building ? 
oh this is fun . 
what building are you in ? 
i'm building , uh , one . 
oh , i'm building two . 
at least we found something different .
not like that . 
isn't that funny ? 
that's funny . 
that is funny . 
so how's the weather in building two ? 
the weather in building two is cold 
it's been cold . 
it's been cold in the building . 
outside the building it's not bad . 
listen i got me doing it . 
typical texas spring . 
are you a native to texas ? 
from california . 
so what do you think of the texas weather ? 
not as nice as california .
how long have you been here ? 
oh , five years now . 
oh , okay . 
i've been here long pretty long . 
you know about august then . 
there's no surprises left . 
a lot of people try to leave the state for a couple of weeks in august , for , you know , 
if they're going to go out of state for vacation 
good idea . 
real good idea . 
we went up to wyoming this last , uh , summer during that time . 
and it was like you know , eighty degrees up there . 
it was beautiful . 
nice to get out of texas for a while . 
we went to alaska . 
well , even farther away . 
that is really nice . 
it is so cool , you wear a jacket , you know . 
even in the summer time , huh . 
or keep one handy .
is that right ? 
uh , it , 
they call it their liquid gold . 
but it , you know , 
you get sunshine , 
and it's lovely , 
and then it rains just enough to keep everything nice 
well , texas isn't bad . 
not in the spring . 
i have to think every year to try to remember what's it supposed to like this time of year . 
spring is nice . 
because march we usually get a lot of rain , in march , you know . 
it'll seem the news , the harold taft , you know , on the local news . 
march we typically get a lot of rain , 
and we've had this many inches , 
and , you know , we're right on target , you know , 
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march , 
but i 
oh , we always 
it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like . 
uh , it , 
i just wish it wouldn't come all at once .
that's right , 
well , it's just that , you know , 
when it rains , it rains . 
in california you get these nice , lovely rains , you know , nothing really you know , like downpours like you have here . 
the other day we had some hail , the biggest hail i've ever seen in texas . 
oh , really . 
i live in garland . 
oh , you got into that bad stuff . 
we got hail the size of marbles . 
i mean , just so noisy hitting the house 
and the glass on the windows . 
it didn't break anything , 
but we went out there afterwards 
and there's ice balls the size of marbles all over our lawn . 
isn't that strange . 
i know , i , 
you pick them up , you know , 
and they're perfectly round . 
i think that's one of the strange things , 
and you very seldom see it though . 
i've seen hail , you know , 
but usually the size , you know , of , uh , tiny pebbles . 
you know , really small , you know . 
but this was , uh , really large . 
so it's a drop of water that had come through quite a few rain clouds apparently . 
is that correct ? 
uh , i don't know how hail is formed 
i think 
you don't think it's cold enough , you know to , 
it's not on the ground , 
must be . 
i guess , 
and then , i think , you know , all that falling would warm it up and melt it , 
but maybe that's what rounds it , i don't know . but , tumbling . 
i was dumb . 
i was in , um , florida for a week on business . 
and i had called back to the house . 
i stayed the weekend , 
and i called back to the house . 
it's in garland where all the bad weather is . 
 and i watched the news , 
and i thought , ha ha , that's garland , that's not plano , 
i don't have anything to worry about . 
i was on the plane heading back to dallas before it dawned on me , stupid , you own property in garland .
felt so dumb . 
finally i got home and found out my property was okay . 
there was no problem with it . 
but i guess you just tend to think of where your house is 
and close to that , what's called duck creek that runs through part of garland , that's the part that always seems to get hardest hit when there's the hard rain . 
oh , oh , i see . 
the creek overflows 
and to get flooded 
oh , okay . 
the streets and stuff around that area ,
that house , 
just going to be blocks off of that new highway one ninety that's going through . 
that's where i live , close to that . 
oh really . 
uh , uh , not quite , 
i don't live in that firewheel division . 
but i live close by there 
is that a nice area ? 
they're supposed to , 
it's getting built up , you know , with more new shopping centers and things . you know , 
it's a fairly new area . 
by ninetythree or ninetyfour or something , 
a brand new mall 
the house that 
it'd be nice . 
in the firewheel estates there , whatever . 
really , really nice home , very pretty . uh . 
but you're not living there right now . 
oh , i see . 
it's investment property . 
i see . 
but it's a very nice place . 
uh , i would cheerfully live there . 
of course it's not my home , 
and i've lived in my home well , almost ten years , 
and , you know , i've got everything just exactly like i want it . 
but if i were to live some place else , it certainly meets my standards . 
it's a nice house . 
that's a nice area . 
is it on the golf course ? 
it's off the golf course , 
and i'll be honest with you , 
i'm going to have to get a map to figure out exactly where is the golf course versus where my house is . 
is that right . 
but it's in the estates that adjoin it . 
well that's a nice area . 
it is . 
that really is a nice area . 
when they get that highway finished , you can hop on that and get anywhere you need to go 
that one nine 
another belt line , just , uh , farther out . 
just continue to do that . 
where are you from in california ? 
southern california . 
san diego ? 
and my parents live in anaheim right now . 
lived up north of los angeles in thousand oaks area , where the cowboys have their training camp , or used to anyway . 
i've been through all of that . 
uh , there is an area beyond thousand oaks , north of los angeles that is really an eerie , strange looking area 
i won , 
they're not really hills , 
they're more like just huge boulders with very little vegetation . 
i'm not familiar with what , 
that is one of the strangest areas i have ever seen . 
uh , i had to go up to t i on business 
out there , 
 and we went up that coastline , 
and i was just amazed how unusual that looks . 
here , hang on just a second , 
i've got a los angeles map . 
i know where that is . 
beyond thousand oaks . 
i know where   valley is , 
i've been out there before , 
you don't think that's strange looking . 
oh , okay 
maybe i'm used to texas . 
maybe texas the way , 
the elevation is extremely high . 
it's got curving roads on it , 
 but the , 
it's just a strange landscape , 
there's very little vegetation . 
i don't remember seeing that part of it . 
i know   valley , 
it's just a suburb of l a . 
it's a , 
and they've built some new highways out to that area , and things , lately . 
people can get in and out of l a easier . 
maybe it's a place i went to , 
it was far extreme , thought we'd never find the place . 
it was interesting .
sounds interesting . 
i know exactly   that area . 
it's a nice area out there . 
i love thousand oaks . 
uh , texas , i don't know , 
you just have less a variety , i guess . 
i don't think it's quite as green , you know . 
it's green with all the trees and things out here 
but it's just , 
oh , it's green sometime . 
but it's just , you know , 
i don't know . 
well , it doesn't stay green , you know 
the really , 
and in all honesty , 
i know this sounds like a texas story , 
all honesty , you haven't seen the hottest of summers if you've only been here five years . 
we haven't had a 
i missed that one of eighty or eightytwo or eightyone 
it may be eightytwo , because we bought our house in eightyone 
and we built a pool in eightytwo , 
um , well , i'm not , 
i mean , i read a lot , 
but i don't read a whole , 
i mean , uh , eh , eh , eh , i tend to read like only out of a couple , you know , groups . 
uh , and uh , i'm a big baseball fan , 
so i tend to read a lot of the baseball books 
i'm a big baseball fan too . 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , i read a lot of science fiction . 
well , i like , 
i teach school , 
and so during the school year , i just don't have time to read . 
and i enjoy it so much . 
but with correcting papers kids of my own , i just don't have time . 
but in the summer , i try to read a lot . 
 and , of course , being a woman , i like romance novels and stuff like that a whole lot . 
i just , 
i really enjoy that because it's kind of a getaway type thing . 
so i read a lot of that . 
but i also love sports . 
and , uh , uh , i don't have time to read in , 
but i do read sports illustrated 
and , uh , but , uh , i don't read a lot of nonfiction , 
and i really should because there's so many selfimprovement books out right now that benefit me greatly , 
but i just don't . 
probably should . 
i don't really read the selfimprovement books or things like that . 
uh , um , i'll get like , uh , books on history and stuff like that that look interesting . 
and uh , of course , i don't ever get around to reading them .
you know , i got , uh , um , 
i belong to quality paperback book club . 
oh , do you ? 
and i'll get stuff out of that . 
like i got battle cry of freedom , you know , 
and i started reading , and got about sixty pages into it 
and it's like eight hundred pages .
oh , my word . 
and it was like , uh , i want to read something else for a while .
it's , i , 
some of those books are real tough to get into , 
but after you get into them , they're really good . 
but it's just tough to get through that first two hundred pages or so . 
well , especially , you know , well , 
battle cry of freedom starts off , you know , in the eighteen forties , you know . 
wait , the war wasn't until the eightee , you know . 
it's like , okay , 
and i realize these things , you know . 
these things take awhile like to move up , 
but you know , it's hard sometimes . 
it's right , 
that's right . 
i find though , that when i find an author , 
uh , and you don't read a lot of fiction , you said . 
 but when i find , 
i read a lot of science fiction . 
do you ? 
when i find an author i really like , i try to read everything they write .
that , and 
i do the same thing . 
uh , there's one science fiction writer named , uh , allen dean foster . 
i've heard of him . 
oh , okay , 
he , um , 
i must have like fifty or sixty books by him .
is that right ? 
i mean , well , almost everything he's ever done . 
and , um , you know , i'm usually going to enjoy it . 
um , so it's really , you know , 
to do that . uh , 
isn't it amazing that somebody can write that many books about science fiction ? 
i think that's unbelievable . 
well , he does a lot of like , um , uh , movie adaptations and things like that . 
oh , does he really ? 
and , uh , his adaptations are usually really good . 
um , it's funny he , um , 
the novelization of star wars was list , 
you know , uh , in the stores as being by george lucas . 
but it turns out that , uh , foster actually , uh , ghost wrote it for him . 
is that right ? 
which , you know , 
when i read it , i should have realized that because , i mean , it had foster's style written all over it .
is that right ? 
well , i've never read anything of his , 
but i've heard about him . 
but wouldn't you think he would , 
does he get some royalties from that , hopefully ? 
well , i would think he would .
i'd hope so . 
well , i mean he's doing all right , probably .
oh , i'm sure he is , 
but sometimes the more you get the more you want too , 
that's true . 
well , yeah . 
you're a baseball fan , 
you're aware of that kind of thing .
oh , yeah . 
oh , right , 
in fact , i'm a sports fan , period . 
i mean , that's why i like to read sports illustrated so much 
because there's everything in it . 
i uh , had a subscription to that last year , 
but uh , i'm mostly a baseball fan . 
so i'm , 
the other stuff is interesting 
but , um , i was mostly interested in the baseball stuff . 
so you're probably , uh , a baltimore fan , right , an oriole fan ? 
uh , actually i'm a red sox fan more than anything . 
is that right ? 
oh , well , that's good too . 
um , but , uh , i do like the orioles also . 
i'm sure you do . 
well i'm a ranger fan simply because i live here . 
but i was , uh , 
i'm not from here . 
i'm originally from ohio , 
so i've always followed the tigers . because , you know , i was , 
i was in toledo last summer . 
went uh , to a mud hens double header .
oh , i love the mud hens .
they're great . 
i love the name 
and , there 
i saved that issue , actually . 
did you ? 
um , that's when i had the subscription . 
it was a lot of fun . 
i li , 
i really enjoy that team . 
we used to go there all the time . 
i used to live in iowa too , 
and they have the iowa oaks . 
and we used to go to their games all the time . 
they don't exist anymore , 
i don't ,
at least not by that name . 
there's the iowa cubs , 
but i don't know if they play ,
 oh , they must , 
i haven't lived there for l , 
i've been here for like twelve years now , 
 and i haven't been back to des moines in a long time . 
and it was kind of fun . 
it's almost , uh , more fun than going to a major league game . 
i don't know , 
i just really enjoy the , 
 minor league , 
it is . 
it's not quite so serious , you know . 
and it's a lot cheaper .
that's for sure , 
it's about 
is that right ? 
and they have a minor league team . 
and i go out there almost as much as the orioles 
and , um , 
is that right ? 
it's just a lot of fun . 
i mean , it's free parking 
and bu , you know , four bucks now to get in . 
and , you know , the hot dogs are a dollar 
 and it's just great . 
 well , like how much is an oriole game ? 
oriole game ? 
if you park in the lot across the street from the stadium , it's four bucks . 
the cheapest ticket you can normally get is like six fifty to seven fifty . 
oh , gosh . 
see , it's higher than the rangers . 
and , um , hot dogs like start at a dollar fifty .
oh , yeah . 
the food here is outrageous . 
but , uh , you can get a good seat for , uh , well 
it used to be three dollars . 
but i think it's gone up to four dollars this year . 
oh , that's nice . 
but , you know , it's in the bleachers , way out you know , in center field , 
but it's still nice . 
you still can see well . 
and , uh , we usually sit there unless somebody gives us tickets , you know , box seats 
well how much are the box seats there ? 
do you know offhand ? 
box seats run from , oh , like eight dollars to twelve dollars . 
um , that's a little steeper . 
i think the , uh , most expensive seats in memorial are eleven bucks . 
but we're getting a new stadium next year 
oh , so it'll go up . 
it'll go up . 
and , if it opens .
it's , uh , something we're really irritated about around here . 
or some people are really irritated about . 
they built the new stadium downtown . 
and they're saying how there's going to be a lot more parking for the stadium . 
but i park for free up at memorial stadium because i know where i can do it for free .
oh , oh . 
and , um , i'm not going to be able to do that downtown .
uh , yeah , that's a bummer . 
well , see , baseball here though is the cheapest game in town . because the cowboys , 
it's outrageous 
and the mavericks are t , 
it's high too . 
 so baseball's cheap ,
weren't you guys , 
well , that didn't go over ,
oh , it didn't , 
so arlington's going to build a stadium , a bigger one . 
oh , okay . 
so they're going to stay there . which is fine , because arlington's got a lot of things to offer . 
main money making , you know , 
and it would have devastated them if they would have taken it away . 
because everything , 
there's six flags right by the stadium , there's a wet 'n wild 
all the tourists come there . 
 and they , 
it would have been devastated , 
they would have collapsed . 
so i'm kind of glad they're staying there . because it's right in the middle of fort worthdallas , 
and , you know , 
that's what i'd always heard , 
i've , uh , 
i like it there . 
and i think dallas has enough to offer that they don't have to hog everything .
so , i'm glad that they're staying in arlington . 
and it's takes us maybe , uh , well , thirtyfive to forty minutes to get there from plano , which is not too bad at all . 
that's about what it takes me to get to memorial . 
and it takes me almost the same amount of time to go to frederick , in , uh , baltimore . 
is that right ? 
because i live just south of the interstate . 
hop on the interstate , 
and the stadium's right off the interstate .
oh , gosh . 
so , it's like i drive west 
and i'm there . 
and , you know , and then to go into baltimore , i mean , well , it's fewer miles , 
but i've got to go , stop and go traffic and everything . 
do you read , um , 
i guess you read sports illustrated 
but you don't read many sports books 
now my son does , 
i have a son that just turned sixteen , 
 and he reads everything get his hands on . 
he's reading a dick vitelle book right now because he's a real big dick vitelle fan . 
he's a basketball fan because he plays for the high school he goes to 
but he's reading it , 
 and he's r , 
you just can't believe all the things he's done . 
and he's really enjoying that . 
and i , 
so maybe i will . 
book called , uh , a season on the brink . 
i never heard that one . 
i'm not sure . 
i don't know . 
i'm trying to think of the guy's name . 
it was like john feinstein or something like that 
i just heard about it the other night . 
uh , i was listening to something on the radio 
and they mentioned that one . 
i'll have to tell my son about that . 
i'm sure he'd like it . 
and , uh , i was thinking about , 
i saw a book kicking around on the history of the a b a , which , 
oh , that would be good 
even when i don't like the sport so much ,  , 
uh , do you have any friends that have children ? 
and what do they say about finding adequate child care ? 
i think that may be the key word . 
i think that's correct . 
they're , uh , relatively nonexistent uh , from what i hear from my friends . 
it seems like , uh , even when they have consulted day care centers that are quote unquote reputable , that are sort of like a chain , if i can use that word 
and , uh , it's just a matter of trust , you know , 
i think they feel that these people are , um , under qualified basically and underpaid , 
and i think that sort of goes hand in hand 
so it's difficult for them . 
well , we certainly found that to be true . 
uh , indeed we've , 
our children are now eleven and nine . 
and we moved away from institutionalized child care 
uh , at one point in time we've had au pairs ,
 and that worked for a while , 
but adequate ones were really tough to find . 
i'm sure that's true . 
it takes that mixture of a very mature college student ,
i do have a friend that , uh , uh , 
she and her roommate became livein care givers 
and they loved it . 
they had stayed with this family from the time these children were small , you know , four or five years old , up until they were well into grade school . 
and , uh , she was paid very well because the parents trusted them 
and they , you know , had done such a good job . 
so , um , i can see where someone , you know , in a position like that , in a livein capacity , would definitely be the way to go if you're lucky enough to have the financial   to be able to do that . 
well , that's true , 
 and that's something that we're struggling with now . 
i think it's just a matter of priorities . 
uh , you know , it's a terrible thing to say when your speaking of children in that way , 
but you still have to be realistic , as well , i think . 
oh , yeah . 
much as other cultures disagree , our lives don't revolve around our children . 
and that's bad to have to admit , too , 
but , uh , you know , it's just , there's so much pressure when you're talking about two people that work outside the home 
 and i think that is one reason why i continue to be without children . 
it's just such a responsibility and when i've had friends that have said , 
when you hear people say , it alters your life forever , please take heed  , well , 
i realize that's true 
so it's , uh , such a responsibility . 
well , it certainly is . uh , 
if i can   the other side of the coin for a moment . 
it is such an honor and a thrill ,
 oh , yeah . 
most of the time .
well , i just have to be honest about it . 
it's not always ,
oh , sure . 
but , you know , it's funny . 
i had a friend that said , you know , before we always said we don't want children because we can't go off on the spur of the moment or this or that and the other 
and she got older 
so  , why am i waiting , you know , 
it's just the way your attitude changes 
and you mature i suppose . 
but the thing about the child care and they both do have to work . 
it's a matter not necessarily , uh , that she might want to stay home or he , as well , 
but , you know , they need the money . 
and , uh , when i seen some of my friends that have taken that six week old baby , you know , to someone else , it's just , i can imagine how emotional it must be . you know , multiplied by the fact that you don't really trust the person or you're uncomfortable with the situation    , as far as child care , um , 
it's just a scary thing . 
well , we were lucky when our children were that age , 
and having lived in a community for a while we knew the person to whom we were entrusting our children . 
 that's a big plus  .
and felt that    ,
and were leaving them   small children . 
but , we also learned something from that experience as our children got older . 
it's that care givers are not omniscient 
they are not all things to all people 
the ones that are good with babies tend not to be good with toddlers . 
i think it takes a , 
i don't know , 
i think your patient level needs to increase as the child gets older .
i think that might be part of the problem with some people . you know , 
taking care of a baby , i know , is not an easy thing , 
but when you have them in , their little feet are moving 
and you have to chase them down constantly . 
i'm sure that's a whole new ball game . 
oh , yeah . 
i have a nine year old that i would trade happily for a baby   .
 oh , really . 
well , you sound like your pretty well passed the worst of it as far as worrying about , 
since they're both in school , you don't have to worry about a fulltime person to take care of them . 
oh , you don't know what happens after they get in school . 
 that's something altogether different , uh . 
oh , yes . 
now we have , uh , one takes piano lessons ,
and the other one , of course can't do the same thing . 
oh , of course not . 
it has to be somewhere else 
and no 
it's not adequate to sit and wait . 
 you can't do that . 
that just , 
that will not do . 
that's out of the question , 
i'm sure . 
of course . 
but , we are helping , you know . 
we are being cooperative , 
what's wrong with you ? 
you don't understand this . 
that's just the way their minds work . 
and it's almost everyday . 
that's amazing . 
it's amazing that people actually , 
the stamina that you must , you know , draw from yourself to deal with it . 
it must be interesting . 
i guess you find out that you're a much stronger person than you thought , maybe . 
well , i've been finding out that i really am a nice person . 
  hit for many years . 
  because i didn't need it . 
and now , i need it . 
now it's just a reservoir that you tend to regularly , i'm sure . 
and it stays low a lot .
well , are your children now , 
do you feel comfortable , um , with them coming home after school until you and your wife get home 
absolutely not . 
no . 
i mean ,   one of them i would leave unsupervised any time , any place , any where . 
uh , the other one i wouldn't leave unsupervised two minutes . 
that's just a difference in kids , i suppose . 
that's true . 
one leads the other ? 
and , uh , 
and it's the one that's going downhill , 
needs more supervision that has a bad influence on the older or more mature one ? 
how unfortunate .
you don't think that good prevails . 
well , i'm living in a dream world , 
what do i know . 
as i said , i don't have kids 
and i'm an only child 
so i've never been around children . 
so , uh , i'm sort of at a loss where that's concerned . 
but i do hear my friends talk about it . 
we're having such fun , 
my wife and i were both only children . 
and we just couldn't wait to have two children so they would be such friends . 
i don't know 
selfish as a child . 
i didn't want a brother or sister . 
and now that i'm older , of course , it's different . 
you know , i think about , uh , wouldn't it be nice , 
but , uh , anyway . 
just make good friends . 
yeah , oh , 
i have wonderful friends . 
that's true 
my best friend is one child of ten . 
and so they just sort of , you know , adopted me as their eleventh child 
so that worked out pretty well . 
she never had to worry about taking anybody to child care because there was always somebody there older to deal with them , 
so i guess , that's an alternative . 
if you could just , um , 
have enough . 
by the time the youngest ones are there , you'll have older one to take care of them . 
that's true . 
i don't know . 
when you see all these horror stories on television about child care 
i just , 
i was seeing something on the television earlier about a little girl that's been telling her mother these terrible stories 
and of course people are denying it . 
and , uh , it's just frightening . 
it really is . 
well , that you don't really don't understand . 
and then you don't really know what happened . 
we gave up on one baby sitter because we came home one night and found pieces of , um , ribbon , 
do you have any pets now ? 
joey , 
the dog is joey ? 
the cat is , 
he's the little boy pomeranian . 
oh , my goodness . 
and we just got a new addition to the family , so to speak , 
we also have a fish . 
oh , my .
 it's a mud dog . 
i beg your pardon . 
it's a mud dog . 
it's , uh , 
well did you all catch it , 
or , uh , 
oh , the mud dog . 
did you catch the fish ? 
and it's all alone in that aquarium . 
we'd like to get him a friend 
but um , uh , we haven't found one yet . 
so how about you , 
do you have any pets ? 
well at the present time i have two dogs . 
oh really , 
what kind ? 
an english setter , you know , 
that's the white dog with the feathers 
and it has ,
and that's a male . 
and i have a wonderful female lab , black lab . 
how long have you had them . 
quite a long time , uh , probably five or six years 
and unfortunately the black lab that's a female , it's the most wonderful animal we've ever had , 
an , i , 
when she was about three years old we noticed that she was having uh , problems limping and so forth 
oh no . 
and it's in that breed . 
but now i think there are tests that can be conducted , uh , to tell whether or not the puppies have it . 
but i think , 
i don't know , 
apparently they've been so well i don't know inbred , or what , 
oh , is that right ? 
well n , 
i'm not sure that's the situation , 
but , it , um , 
for those dogs that are registered 
and if you should have one , uh , that also has hip dysplasia you cannot breed it , uh . 
i had no idea , 
i didn't even know that . 
but she's wonderful . 
um , our dog , joey , has , uh , a back problem . 
um , like ha , 
what are the 
uh , he's got a bad back 
but he's seven , uh , 
i guess he's almost eight years old . 
um , he just , uh , 
he doesn't , 
he rolls o , 
he doesn't like to roll over . 
um , e , 
you just , 
when you touch him a certain way on the back , 
but otherwise , he can jump , uh , you know , just as long as he doesn't bend a certain way . 
um . well , uh , i have had just wonderful luck with this lab , uh , 
when i , 
uh , let's see , winter before last we would bring her in , uh , when it was cold . 
and she wouldn't , 
i , you know , 
the next morning you want to take them out , 
and she wouldn't , 
i couldn't get her up without which it was pretty hard to do at eighty pounds . 
i bet . 
um , until , 
if i allowed her to not get up on her own , it'd be two o'clock in the afternoon . 
anyway , i , uh , met my son's , uh , college roommate , is a vet 
and he said , um , let's give her some race horse shots . 
and you know in , 
because you all the time , you know , run into people with problems . 
oh , yeah . 
anyway , that's when we lived in oklahoma , 
uh , so he gave this dog a series of    , 
they give it to race horses , uh , to get rid of , uh cartilage , 
and it's called   .
anyway , it's a series of six shots , once a week , 
and then i noticed after two shots she was , 
do you have to give those ? 
but i can't give a shot . 
oh , i 
believe me , i understand . 
i took her from enid , oklahoma to oklahoma city every week for six weeks . 
and , uh , after the second shot she was significantly better . 
then i didn't notice any improvement till after the sixth one . 
and ever since , 
and he said , uh , a booster , uh , every year or two ,
and when i notice in the winter , when it's worse , you know , it's cold weather and so forth then i have , uh , gotten a booster for her . 
but not many people in this part of the country know anything about   .
i've had to get it from oklahoma . 
they've heard about it 
but they've really never used it . 
i've never heard anything about it either . 
so dogs that get down in the hips , 
like i think german shepherds do it , and probably large dogs . 
and , uh , it's just wonderful . 
does he get , 
is he an inside dog also , 
or does he just run out in the backyard ? 
is he fenced in ? 
um , um , well we're living now in an area where we're in the woods 
and we take walks . 
i just don't let them ,
oh , yeah , 
but we take walks through the woods twice a day . 
oh , that's nice . 
and , uh , i can over do it on her . 
oh , yeah . 
but anyway , at least she can go 
and she's not limping along and all that . 
tell me about your cat . 
oh , stripper , well he started out being a little orphan , 
and we took him in 
and , uh , he's about two years old now 
and he loves his treats , 
uh , both , uh , joey and , uh , stripper get treats .
and , uh , let's see , 
oh , well he's outside 
and , uh , 
he's got free access of a window we like to keep open . 
so , he gets to go in and out whenever he wants to . 
well of course . 
that's nice , 
joey , on the other hand is a little different . 
he has to go out whenever , uh , we ask him 
and uh , he barks . 
he'll either bark for food , or he'll bark to go out 
and he'll tell you which one he wants . 
he's been through obedience school . 
 well he just can , 
well he has been trained 
it is wonderful , 
i have some neighbors across the field , 
and , um , they 
when we first moved here , uh , when the dogs and i didn't fe , 
we have a very nice kennel and everything 
i didn't want to , 
i just wanted to let them be able to be free for a while . 
so i kept watch and never let them get away , 
but now every couple weeks , one would slip away 
and my neighbor said to me , oh , i noticed those dogs are so well trained , 
anytime they hear your voice , they come . 
so that made me very proud .
oh , yeah .
i'm not for sure . 
i'm not either , 
well , um , so it sounds like you keep your pets for pleasure . 
oh , definitely . 
oh , okay , um , 
oh really , 
so i didn't know if they stop you when the time is up 
i glanced at the clock when , um , we started 
and i love gardening 
and she did too , 
oh , well , at least you know you did your part . 
oh , i see . 
that's true . 
um , so . 
i mean , i , 
but i have a hard time getting anybody , because i guess , 
do you work . 
um , yes 
and probably just got home . 
so , um , during the day , i me , 
i thi , 
and i understand also they want men . 
i was going to tell you the same thing . 
they're really looking for a lot more men to participate . 
my husband does . 
does he . 
i need to , 
i've got some applications , 
i need to hand them out . 
i think so too , 
 well good . 
 well maybe i'll get you next time . 
it so much fun to talk to you . 
all right , 
have a good one . 
you too , 
well , maybe a chicken dish 
 and , um , i guess i usually plan probably a lettuce salad and a potato dish , 
and we usually serve fresh fruit and , uh , then make a dessert . 
oh , that sounds good . 
so that makes , 
uh , we're not , uh , real wealthy at the moment . 
last time i had people over for dinner we had lasagna , 
and i used my mother's recipe , 
i really like it . 
it's got , um , 
you cook the noodles and brown hamburger and put tomato sauce in with it 
and , i'm not sure she even puts , 
must be some italian spices in there . 
i can't remember . 
but , um , for the cheese part , you mix , uh , sour cream , and cream cheese and cottage cheese 
well , that sounds good . 
it's good . 
and , then , uh , uh , tossed salad and , um , oh , 
my goodness , diane , get down from there . 
 and , uh , let's see , 
what else did i serve with that . 
bread , do you have bread to go with it ? 
i have a recipe that's .
oh , well , lasagna's always wonderful for large crowds . 
the short cut on the cooking for lasagna , 
they've told me that they go to sam's and buy a great big pan of lasagna . 
i've heard that sam's has a really good lasagna 
in fact i think i had it at a party once . 
did you ? 
it was good . 
well , have served it 
and they say , gosh , if you have company coming 
and they said it's good . 
so , that , always sounds good to me , um , 
i feel like i'm in the kitchen cooking a lot . 
oh , i know . 
just for family . 
oh , yeah . 
so , feels like i'm often in the kitchen . 
not my favorite place , but .
but a time consuming place . 
let's see , 
what else do we like to have for , 
trying to think what else i like to serve . 
my mother likes to serve taco grandes . 
have you ever had , 
i don't know , 
what that is . 
you take a flour tortilla 
and you fry it like a taco 
 and you , uh , 
for all the inside parts you brown hamburger and put some , um , tomato sauce in it , 
 and i like to just add picante sauce to get the mexican flavor 
so you don't have to mess with spices and stuff . 
and , then , um , let's see , 
and you heat up refried beans , 
and you cut up tomatoes and lettuce and grated cheese , 
and what you do to make it , you take the shell and you spread the beans on first , 
then you put the meat , 
then you put the grated cheese , 
and then you put , um , 
let's see , what's next , 
then , i usually put the cut up tomatoes next 
and you can put , uh , like guacamole and 
katy , i'm on the phone . 
well , get a towel or go change . 
i'm on the phone . 
 um , oh a little sour cream is good 
do you like to make your own guacamole ? 
uh , yeah . 
we don't make it very often , i guess , 
but , uh , 
i don't very often . 
usually when we get avocados my kids just like to eat them plain 
oh do they ? 
 so . yeah . 
i just cut slices off 
oh , that's good , 
or it's always good on top of something in the sandwich . 
oh , well , i made guacamole that i would take to a pool party across the street the other day , 
 and everyone there said they never made guacamole salad . 
what you want . 
well , i don't know , 
i guess they don't have it at home , 
i can't imagine it would stay fresh long enough to , 
i guess they just buy it at a restaurant when they eat it at a restaurant maybe . 
they just said they never had it at home . 
so you know , taking this as a dip , i thought , gosh , you know , sometimes when we have it at home it , it turns dark on the top 
so i just , 
it helps if you leave the pit in it . 
oh , does that help ? 
that's supposed to help um , keep it from turning brown so quick . 
well , that day i just took extra lemon and just squeezed across the top 
and it really stayed longer than i 
oh , that's good . 
i thought maybe that was the trick . 
that probably helps , too . 
so . oh , well . i guess we bought a lot of , 
we've been buying turkey lately , instead of beef , 
do you want it ? 
even though , you know , 
 oh , yeah 
we have too , 
the ground turkey , the meat is softer 
and i , 
 do you want scrambled ? 
so . sometimes it seems to be cheaper , too , 
so we 
we buy it , 
if you get it on sale , 
so we bought that 
or we bought the filets , and then the chicken , or turkey nuggets , 
and i don't think anybody in my house knows the difference ,
or in , 
i don't think mine know either . 
in fact , we've been getting lunch meat that's turkey , too . 
it costs less than the other , 
i don't know , 
there's supposed to be something more healthy about it .
poultry instead of the beef and 
i can't think of any other specific things i like to serve . um , 
i always like dessert .
one salad that we always like , my sisterinlaw always brings to family dinners , is a , 
i don't know what you call it . 
uh , you mix , um , cottage cheese and a package of jello and a thing of , uh , like cool whip 
that's good 
that's always good , 
we make and it's really for special occasions is cheese cake , 
and we take a recipe from my grandmother , you know 
it's probably fairly typical , cream cheese and egg and sugar , and the insides of a , 
well , this is the season for vacations . 
and , uh , i guess for places i like to go , i enjoy going to the beach and being outdoors somewhere . 
someplace that's very different than texas . 
and i , 
outside activities , 
enjoy going places where , 
i enjoy playing tennis , 
so i like to have a tennis court there , 
 or if it's at the beach , the beach is great . 
a pool is great . 
 and , i   , 
where do you usually go ? 
oh , well , let's see , 
we have plans this year to drive up to the , uh , to colorado . 
and , we will be going to estes park , and colorado springs , 
one year we went to the southwest corner of colorado , into durango and north of the area there . 
and i , 
boy that's a nice place to visit . 
it's really nice at , 
there's a nice train ride that goes up to the city of silverton where they used to do a lot of silver mining . 
on a smaller scale , i guess , than silverton . 
of mountains that are covered with , uh , boulders . 
so , i guess people jeep through that area 
and we did not have a chance to do that . 
but , i sure would like to go back there and do that again . 
uh , we have not had a vacation in several years , 
so , be our first chance in awhile , uh , 
we are going to go to , uh , destin , florida , which is a very nice beach area , if you are not familiar with it . 
i have not been , 
but i have heard it's wonderful . 
oh , it's gorgeous . 
uh , we used to go quite a bit , uh , before i moved out here . 
we were closer and , uh , used to go almost every summer , uh , and , rent a condo there on the beach . 
uh , of condominiums there on the beach front . 
very large condos . 
and , they have quite a few rooms , we will usually rent one for about a week or so . 
and the ,
go down . 
sea shells . 
enough to make it . 
i am sorry . 
sea shells . 
uh , there's not as many sea shells along there , uh , 
that's the only thing that they really do not , 
they have some , but not , not so much . 
um , if you go further down , uh , you will usually find some , but not right in there . 
uh , i do not know why it is , 
but , uh , it  just ,  
right there . 
but , uh , we enjoy it , uh , 
we usually stay at the same place every year , 
and they are , like i say right on the beach . 
oh , where do you stay ? 
my husband always wants to go to destin , 
we just have not gone that direction yet . 
it's a place called jetty east , uh , j e t t y e a s t , 
and it's , uh , called that because it's at the very end of , uh , a jetty there , which is ,
and , uh , it's at the very end , 
it's the last set of condominiums there , 
and uh , it's very nice . uh , 
it's not very expensive , uh , 
you can , 
i think we are going to go with another couple and their kids . 
and , uh , we have a , uh , i think it's three bedroom or two bedroom , uh , condominium , which will sleep , i do not know , quite a few  about   ,
and , uh , i think it's going to cost us , per couple , about three hundred dollars for the week . 
oh . that's nice . 
it really is , 
because , uh , full size ,
and , this one , i think has two baths , 
and it's , 
the one we got is on the beach side . 
oh , nice . 
we have got a beautiful view and balcony , 
and , uh , just , 
you know , it's really a nice stay . uh , 
in fact , we stayed there on our honeymoon , 
i had won a trip to the bahamas , but did not get to take it on our honeymoon time , 
so we instead went there , uh , and loved it just as much as if we had gone to the bahamas . 
 uh , uh , uh , suite we had gotten was very nice 
but , uh , it's a pretty nice place , 
you will need to try to go and ,
well , we have just 
it's a little far from here , 
but , uh , 
are you driving ? 
it will take , uh , a day and a half to get there , probably . 
well , we are , 
the neighborhood that we live , they are switching to an alternate calendar this year , 
so it , 
well , starting at the end of july , we will have two vacation weeks in october and two vacation weeks in march . 
so that will be an interesting turn on vacations for our family . 
so , i , 
uh , what does that mean , alternate ? 
well , it's , 
what it truly is supposed to mean is nine weeks of school , three weeks of vacation ,
two month break . 
they hope to boost the learning of the children .
i see . 
so , uh , 
kind of scattering the vacation throughout the year . 
maybe within a year , we will see how that falls .
we will head for florida , maybe in somewhat of an off season , instead of summer . 
so , uh . 
so long . 
thanks a lot . 
all right 
 and your occupation is teaching ? 
substitute teacher . 
is this pat i'm talking to now ? 
i'm a substitute teacher , in , i believe , the same school system we both work in . 
well , i was just trying to make an introduction , here .
oh , okay . 
 and i haven't told you i'm going to be at a different school this year , now . 
i've just gotten another job at an elementary library at barron . 
well , i bet you may dress differently , then , for that . 
every day i've got to , uh , read to kindergartners , 
so i'm going to be down on the floor with them . 
i've got about forty kindergartners i'm going to be working with every day for , uh , you know , a half hour . 
so you know 
well , of course , you've been at clark enough that you know it's always cold .
but , you don't know , uh , i guess at some of the other schools you go to unless you've been there . 
and it's interesting to notice when you go to different schools that some are a little more fancier than others and have a very casual , uh , 
i think some of the dress codes are different at different schools . 
that's whether she would allow slacks 
and she said she doesn't have a problem with that , 
she just didn't like sloppy dressing . 
and i'm , 
basically , about once a week i try to wear a skirt . 
maybe wear longer sleeve shirts than i do in the summer . and add a heavier jacket or , you know , wear jackets more in the winter than i do in the summer . 
that's about , 
i don't really work in a profession that requires that i wear a business suit and , you know , look really , 
and , well , for me sometimes , they even have dress up days 
or they , you know , that you wear your different outfits 
 and you have to have the color for that particular school if you choose to participate in 
and one might be a hat day where you have to come up with some 
and then many schools on a particular day during , uh , i guess football season , maybe all year long , they wear the school colors for , uh , game day 
on what , thursday . 
it might be thursday for the high schools 
and it may be friday for the senior high schools . 
so that would kind of give you a clue , i guess 
 and sometimes you get the long term stuff 
so you're aware ahead of time 
so that's , 
and i don't know , you know , 
i think about , well , the dress code they have for the kids , you know . 
they put one on the parents , or the teachers and say the men have to wear ties 
and there can be no blue jeans worn 
and , because some of the teachers i know wear , uh , dress up jeans , not sloppy looking jeans 
and , uh , you know , they'll wear it with a nice top . 
 and , uh , i don't know that that looks that bad . 
but , if you're going to tell the kids they have to dress up , i guess you can tell the teachers that , too . 
i see that the , 
i think the elementary school teachers , or maybe even the middle school teachers dress a little fancier than some of the high school teachers , i think . 
but just so much . 
anything can go . 
and you can see in some of the departments in some of the schools , like history at clark , they're all pretty fancy . 
but they're just sort of into clothes , 
and then there's other departments 
and they'll just wear your common , ordinary , you know , whatever you 
there's a couple 
and so you try to maybe follow those if you know you're going there , 
you don't want to dress too tacky because you're going to be in the same room with them . 
well , and you always , 
or you're going 
 and you know , english , or whatever that they had to wear a tie . 
some of those male coaches , that might really , 
they go around in their little coaching shorts or 
and a tshirt . 
that i didn't ever understand . 
i mean we've got coaches that teach health for five periods and then have athletics sixth period 
so  , 
well at 
they dress pretty good , i would say 
and then they go to their coaching 
and they put their shorts 
change then . 
well , see , that's what i would think . 
that's what i would think . 
but , or anything . 
they dress like any other teacher would in 
course , we had one coach , one period he'd teach p e and the next period health and then a period of p e 
those i can understand . 
 and that's hard . 
you know , so he just left warmups on , 
 but , uh , no , 
i think , really probably , they could , uh , really , 
and i don't know make uniforms the thing for the kids , 
i guess the teachers will have to follow suit with a dark skirt and a white top 
i don't think we'll ever get to that . 
you don't think so . 
i think we're going the opposite direction . 
it's the parochial schools that i guess many ti , 
they've had uniforms for years , 
i don't really know if they still do . 
well , some of them , yes they do 
 and it's not 
it certainly makes it easier to dress . 
but even there's a couple public schools in dallas where the kids wear uniforms and the teachers , you know , dress 
well , it's certainly cheaper and easier in the long run , i think , that you don't have to be concerned about your wardrobe . 
well i think it would make a difference at school . 
shorts , too short 
or they've got the really short skirt and the black nylons and the high , you know , 
i mean 
and yet we can't to that either . 
i'd like to see them go to not necessarily a uniform , but saying that they've got to wear a button down shirt . you know , 
that would alleviate any tshirts with sayings on them . 
but if they could wear a buttondown shirt and a pair of dark slacks and they could buy them anywhere they wanted 
but i doubt that that would come ab , 
and then the girls , 
just  , 
i don't , 
not in plano . 
they may get a , 
 but they said in the dallas schools that that helps their educational process there . 
well , i think it does . 
of trying to compete . 
highland park's thinking about going that route . 
so it , 
and then i think that's going to push teachers to dress a lot more professionally than they do . 
i don't think a lot of teachers are very professional 
i agree with you on , 
good morning . 
do you have recycling in sachse ? 
and , they have their own special bin that they hand it out to everybody 
and they take it . 
oh really ? 
 and it's twice a week ? 
we have ,
used to be we put all of our trash in green bags and the trash men came out twice a week and picked up . 
and now they have , uh , these large green containers 
and you have to put your trash that you don't recycle in there . 
and then they haven't started curbside recycling yet , 
but they're planning on doing it very soon . 
apparently the trucks that they had , um , lined up , they needed the parts for ,
and so that put off the program for a while . 
but , uh , do you recycle ? 
do they ? 
put it that way . 
so that's been their summer money 
and they're fixing to go to disneyland . 
oh , well 
 that's great . 
 well that's the way we started too . 
my daughter was going ,
and she had to earn money for it 
and she was too young to babysit . 
so , that's how she started . 
she started recycling cans 
and from there we now recycle glass and newspapers and , uh , aluminum cans and plastics . 
is that the same way as with the aluminum cans where you go 
and they ,
um , the rest of it we just do because my husband has become hooked on recycling . 
and so , you know , we don't get paid for that 
but that's okay . 
 you know , it's not that much of a bother really . 
you just have to rinse out your bottles or whatever 
and we use a lot of ,
it's amazing how much plastic you generate . 
i was amazed at how many cans 
and i was thinking , you know maybe i'd help supplement it , you know 
but it's amazing how many cans you go through .
it really is . 
and how much we have reduced our waste .
um , i know our neighbors , when we first went to this bin program said , oh , there's no way , you know we're going to have to have pickup twice a week . 
they were real upset 
but they were only picking up once a week . 
and we said to them , if you recycle ,   you know , you'll go two weeks without having to put out the green container . 
and , uh , it's really amazing . 
the other thing he does , that my husband a real stickler about is we don't collect our grass clippings . 
he got a little mulcher thing . 
it's just a little attachment for the lawn mower 
and we mow once a week . 
you know , no more often then that . 
and then the clippings just get mulched up and then just lay uh , the lawn . 
and it's amazing , 
we don't collect any of that 
and that has cut down a lot in what we throw out . 
  we don't catch it either , mainly because my husband rarely has time to mow the yard . 
so , if it gets mowed , i do it normally . 
and i can't mow the yard with the grass catch on it . 
it's too heavy . 
 so i just mow it and leave it . 
it just soaks in . 
sure it does . 
it really does 
and it , 
actually they say that you're wasting fertilizer 
that's that much fertilizer you have to use because it does fertilize the lawn . 
it's amazing . 
oh , i like it better doing it . 
well one , 
it cuts down on my mow time anyway 
that's true . 
 and you zip through it quicker . 
that's true . 
well , i really think you're going to get hooked on plastics and paper before you know it . 
we probably will . 
it's really not that much trouble . 
we keep a large plastic , uh , garbage bag in the garage . 
and as soon as we use something , you know , we crush it up and put it out there 
and then , you know , every few weeks we have a recycling center like near walmart . 
they have the containers that you can just go over there and drop it in 
and it's really no trouble . 
and , uh , i feel like at least we're doing something . 
you know ,    , um , i read a magazine article 
and they said something about how you don't realize even just your small contribution , it seems like a small contribution 
but it's not . 
if everyone were to recycle just their newspapers , they would save thousands and thousands of trees a day . 
and , uh , when you read that you think , well gee , maybe it is a big deal ,
is when they show the dump sites 
 or like in new york , the barges that 
 and they don't have any place to put it 
and it just floats in the    , 
it's like ugh . 
and that's really not necessary . 
it really isn't 
if everybody would do just a little bit it would make a big difference . 
it would make a huge impact . 
so , i'm excited about the recycling program in plano .
i , can't wait for them to get it started .
you know , like i said , now we have to take it over to walmart . 
it would be real nice if they just came by and just picked up . 
 um  , 
 now what do they pick up ? 
it's just , 
they pick up the plastic , the glass , and the newspaper . 
oh they do ? 
and do you have to sort that ? 
 and they will do the alum , 
or do you just put it all in . 
and i guess they do the sorting . 
but , um , they'll do the aluminum cans too 
but we don't give them those .
the kids keep those .
so you're doing that now ? 
you're doing the newspapers and the glass ? 
 oh , uhhuh . 
so we don't have the newspapers but the plastic and the glass .
at first , when it first started , it was hard .
he would get all upset 
and i'd say , 
it's just such an automatic reaction . 
and now 
it is . 
i mean , it's really funny . 
we really , 
once you get into the habit of it , it's okay , 
it's just making it a habit that's hard .
oh , i know . 
well the kids have even got to the point where they're , oh , no , don't do that 
and they go to the sink , they rinse them out , and they put them upside down , they let them drain 
and , i put them in a big bag anyway 
 and then they dump the bag out 
and then they crush them . 
 so that's 
that's fun . 
oh , that's a lot of fun . 
well , that's great . 
well i'm to hear you're ,
my sister was here recently from connecticut 
and they have a deposit on all their bottles and cans . 
oh really ? .
where do you live ? 
in plano . 
in plano ? 
where do you live ? 
in dallas . 
oh , okay .
uh , the air pollution isn't too bad in our area . 
so , we're very fortunate 
 um , i was trying to think , uh , 
something we were watching the other day 
and they were doing an overview of los angeles , uh , from an area that was up higher 
and you literally could see the band of smog . 
that , uh , 
i've never been out there , 
i haven't either . 
well , i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that 
and , unfortunately , i think there are a lot of areas that are , that bad . 
particularly in the areas where there are industries , uh , where they are burning a lot of coal ,
i think it's a bigger problem . with the car pollution , antipollution devices , 
i think , uh , air isn't as bad it once was , from the cars , because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area . 
well , i know , uh , that's been the concern in europe . 
they hadn't , 
uh , we have friends in germany and , uh , have family that live near the black forest area 
and  , devices required on the cars , uh , 
that's something that europe didn't do right away 
and now they're doing that 
and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country , that's the only pollution that's been there . 
it's not an area that is industry 
but they were losing a lot of , uh , trees and a lot of , 
from acid rain ? 
i think a weak acid . 
it just makes the rain fall on the acid side 
and after a period of time , i think that accumulates in , uh , trees because they take it up through their roots , as well as it landing on the leaves , on surfaces , 
like you've seen what it's done to buildings even 
about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was , 
and there wasn't from various kinds of energy . 
and , uh , at that point in time , one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain 
and it was kind of poohpoohed , you know . 
oh , you're making a mountain out of a molehill , kind of thing . 
and it's turned out that , that's been very true , what he was forecasting about the accumulation of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage . 
so , it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course . 
now , a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear . 
uh , i'm not afraid of nuclear , having had that course because of how the nuclear that , uh , they use is not bomb quality , 
and , we're so strict with all our controls in the united states . the chances of an accident are slight , 
and , it doesn't pollute the air at all . 
it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant . 
many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants . 
it's kind of funny because people are just petrified , at least some are , at the thought of nuclear . 
so , i don't know . 
in europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power 
and they recycle the fuel 
and then instead of , 
some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become , uh , bomb quality . 
but , that's the only sensible thing to do , is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground . as far as i'm concerned , where it could eventually , perhaps , there's some problem , uh , pollute the groundwater . 
so , i don't know what the answer is . 
the best answer , of course , would be solar or , uh , .
my line gets some static . 
i don't know why . 
but , uh , solar , of course , would be the cleanest . 
well , i know it's    , um , 
we did have a solar water heater when we lived in houston 
and , uh , oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal . 
but , uh , when we lived in houston we had a solar water heater 
and we have enough clouds that , uh , there are other areas that would be better suited . 
that surprised me because i think ,
 and it , 
it can be used 
and it can help 
but , uh , that was a problem that they were still working on . 
oh yeah . 
it's still got a long way to go . 
 well i , 
it's just , you know , a possible solution 
it may not in all ways . 
maybe they'll come up with fusion . you know , be able to control it . 
i don't know how long that'll take , 
but , one of these days , 
because that's perfectly clean . 
it's just we can't control it . 
right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out , 
so , it isn't , not at all , 
and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field , 
so that's not going to work . at least not now . 
but , uh , who knows what the future will hold . uh , as far as energy goes , 
future energy problems , we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well . 
uh , i hope so .
i do to . 
i like to be optimistic , 
i don't like to be pessimistic about these things . 
well , i do think , um , 
i mean , you've already mentioned several things , i think , uh , just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in , uh , 
we have one earth ,
and we got to take care of it . 
i've noticed young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment 
and so , if we can raise uh , you know , generations with those concerns , we'll solve a lot of our problems . 
i'm afraid , 
i know i was part of the me generation where people didn't care . 
you know , 
it's whatever , you know , 
recycle , well , if it's a problem , forget that . 
uh , not throw the trash out the car window 
and leave it in the car and then throw it away ? 
how horrible , you know . 
now , i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes , 
and  . . . 
 so , how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
 well , it's , 
i am pretty much against it .
how about you ? 
oh , i'm pretty much for it . 
oh , good 
we can have a debate . 
 we'll have some interesting discussion , i guess . 
well , like , um , i don't know , 
i think that i , 
one of the reasons that i'm against it is that , uh , um , i'm afraid of someone losing their life , for um , wrongly , 
 and , uh , another reason , 
but one of the arguments that really ,
but then i thought about it 
and i thought , well , the loss that i would feel at losing my mother 
it would never be equal , 
how about you ? 
well , i guess i can see it from several different perspectives , 
but , you know when i hear about things like , you know , to me i don't see any way of rehabilitating the guy . 
you know , maybe there is , i don't know . 
that's true . 
but , you know , and , you know , he's never going to be , to me , a functioning part of society . 
he's already been either paroled , or whatever , for child molestation . 
i mean , i don't know , 
i really have a hard time with that because he really sounds like a real sicko . 
and , you know , for the things he's done , 
i don't know , 
i guess it's either , you know , put him in jail for the rest of his life , you know , or capital punishment i guess . you know 
oh , really . 
or whatever 
and people crime is still climbing 
and we need to have different punishments you know . 
but i just am scared of capital punishment ,
i mean you know there there is always that chance 
but you know i guess to some people it'd almost be better to die to them than to spend life in prison or whatever i mean i don't know 
uh , you know , but that would be a situation where if somebody you know was gonna be , you know 
for any situation really . 
but , uh , you know , when you find somebody just like that situation , i mean , it was disgusting when i read about it today . 
and when you find someone like that , that you know is guilty , he confessed already to killing eleven 
especially when it's so far removed . 
if it's no one that i know 
 and trying to rehabilitate him , too , 
and , you know , 
letting him out again .
and , uh , you know , nobody wants that . 
you know , everybody would be just as scared to death , you know . 
we've had a real problem here in texas with , uh , prison overcrowding 
and they've been releasing people left and right 
and , you know , they've committed murders and rapes and everything else , 
and , you know , you just think , you know , where's the justice here . 
i mean , you know , they're not even having to serve out what they should be serving . 
that's true . 
you know , i just recently moved to massachusetts . 
i'm not sure what their policy is on capital punishment 
but , uh , i do know that they are notorious for paroling people . 
oh , really ? 
and then having them reconvicted for 
i guess , if , 
because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment 
i guess violent crimes would be the crimes where i can see it making the most sense . 
you know , violent crimes uh , with just malicious intent . 
well , you know , that's exactly , i mean , or capital punishment is the perfect solution in every case , you know , especially because there are some cases when you just don't know 
and this guy in , in milwaukee . 
i mean , it , 
he pretty much confessed to it . 
i mean , they , you know , 
just everything , i mean , cannibalism and everything else , uh , 
because , i mean , that's just awful . 
and what is he going to do prison to the other people  ? 
well , i have a hunch that , you know , the other prisoners aren't going to be too happy with him anyway . either , 
i mean , you know they , 
i don't know , 
from what i hear about jail life is not any way to live . 
 but , uh , i don't know . it's just , 
well , i saw on a human interest story , or whatever today , there was a woman who was just being paroled and trying to make it back , 
but she said , uh , you know , in prison you can get anything . 
you can any drugs you want . 
it's just like being outside . 
you know , people 
and there's a power structure that you have bow to 
who have been there for over , and over , and over , it really isn't , uh , as bad . 
i mean , there's , 
it's not that bad of a life as it should be 
but the society is turned against punishment and more towards rehabilitation 
well , you know , especially like repeat offenders . 
 you know , they even get a ten year sentence and be out in , in two , or three , or four years . 
you know , that's scary because , you know , i'm not sure , i think we're paroling them without even knowing if they're , you know , going to be committing any more violent acts or not . 
and what they're going to be doing when they 
and , it's really scary .
i me , you know , 
i don't know what the perfect solution to that is 
but i know that especially with violent crimes where , you know , you're nearly a hundred percent convinced that they're guilty and without much repentance or anything else , you know , then , i don't know , i just really don't see much use for this guy in milwaukee , you know . 
for instance , i mean , that's just , 
i could see capital punishment in a case like that . and , you know , for other people , too , that do things , like that . 
but , uh , when , 
and she picked up the phone 
so she was , uh , 
handed it to you ? 
oh , oh , i see . 
but , uh , you know , i don't know , 
i struggle with it , 
but i don't know that anybody would feel good , you know , like if you let someone like that loose in your community . 
you know , i'm su , 
you'd have to be scared to death .
well , maybe if they could , uh , 
if they had more money or more resources to work more on rehabilitation , 
i mean , deep down i think every human  , 
do you subscribe to magazines yourself ? 
i don't , uh , subscribe to any magazines at home , because we get so many at work that , uh , i need to read that , uh , i just don't take any at home . 
oh , i see . 
i get , uh , mccall's . 
of course , anything that appeals to the homemaker since that's my main line of interest . 
and then once in a while i'll pick up a working woman or something and 
and , uh , i read magazines mainly because they're fast 
and if i want to relax while i watch t v , 
of course , i'm one of those that does two things at once , 
and , uh , i read good housekeeping and better homes and mccall's . 
and i like them because they're kind of short and to the subject . 
at home . 
and then you stopped them all . 
but , yeah , 
the subscriptions ran out 
and i never renewed them . 
and i found that i really didn't have time at home since i work , to read them . 
i find that , uh , about two years is probably my max 
and then i kind of get turned off by it .
good housekeeping is the one that kind of sets around for uh , when i'm really have time and i really want to read something , you know . 
i don't get into books too often because i have so many things that i stay occupied with 
and we travel a lot 
so i enjoy reading parts on travel in the various 
and i get into , uh , newspapers , 
so i guess that kind of tells you what kind of person i am . 
i'm , read it fast and put it down .
when i had my magazines at home , i would find that i kind of skimmed through them and looked at the pictures , you know , 
but otherwise than that , you know , they were , uh , you know , not too useful to me . you know 
i got some good recipes from them sometimes , 
you clip recipes 
and you save them forever 
and you never really 
that's right , 
that's right . 
and then every so often you weed through them 
and you think , where did i ever put that recipe . 
but , uh , that's mainly my , uh , whole idea on 
i subscribe , like i said , to a few 
and once in a while i buy that new magazine called first on the newsstands 
but i kind of stay with my own subject matter what , uh , pertains to my daily life 
 well , since i work with computers during my work , i have to keep up on all the new computer equipment and software and everything . 
and i have to read the magazines , you know , such as byte , and computer world and mac world and all of these ,  , uh , magazines such as that , 
so i really , 
i can see that it will be a very long time , probably , before i subscribe to any magazines at home . 
well , sometimes , in public transportation 
but i think , 
and the idea good , 
i can just dump them at the other end  , 
and i don't have to carry them back with me . 
that's right . 
i do that when we travel . 
i always have my head with a magazine somewhere as we 
no matter what it is , air travel or anything and i , 
you know , a cosmopolitan or something 
although now , 
but , uh , you know , that's basically just about  , 
i'll buy a crossword puzzle magazine every now and then .
that's when you really have time . 
now see your computer ones , 
i got into computer work somewhat , uh , 
we have our own computer system at home 
 and i tried , uh , reading the magazines hoping i would get more from it 
and it was just above my head without having someone there to give me the advice as i went along . 
it was , you know , kind of a little bit more than what i needed , 
so i never did get into them . 
 , when i bought the computer , all of a sudden i was receiving them , for some unknown reason , through the mail . 
i think they all thought , well , we have a live one .
but they were wrong . 
i never got into them . 
all right , i guess we might as well end our conversation at this point . 
it was nice talking with you . 
thank you . 
bye , now . 
do you have any hobbies ? 
what are yours ? 
china painting and ceramics . 
ooh , how great . 
i enjoy it . 
i enjoy the china more . 
the china more . 
and now that i have my eyes , the delicate part of china painting , i do enjoy it . 
how did you ever get into that ? 
that sounds so interesting . 
my husband kept begging me , 
and he's been dead now for twenty years , 
so you understand that this was a long time ago . 
but he finally brought me the china , the book , the brushes and he said i have made arrangements for your lessons . 
how marvel , 
and i said i'll do it for three months 
and if i don't like it , that's it . 
well , i painted an awful lot until his death , which was several years . 
and it has just been the most relaxing , enjoyable  , selfsatisfying thing i've had . 
now , do you do it just for yourself , 
or do you do it to give as gifts , 
or do you actually sell it ? 
i have sold quite a bit . 
i give a lot to our two daughters that are grown and have their home  , 
and then i just have the rest of my house with lot of hand painting in it . 
oh , that sounds mar , 
now , do you work outside of the home ? 
i have just retired . 
you've just retired . 
oh , oh , what a great 
it's not , 
it's a great hobby , 
but don't retire .
don't retire . 
well , see , i don't , 
i never , uh , returned to work for the p , 
i have stayed home for about the last nine years . 
oh , have , well , 
we've transferred around , 
and our last area was in a rural section right on the lake , uh , on lake erie . 
so the lake life appealed to me , 
and my husband's working 
and he left it up to me if i worked or not . 
so , in my spare time , i love to sew . 
there aren't too many people around anymore that really enjoy sewing , 
but i do make all my own clothes 
and we recently purchased a new home , 
so i enjoy doing my , uh , toppers for my window applications 
oh , uhhuh . 
but , uh , just when i thought i really enjoyed my hobby , yours sounds great .
 well , my sister is the seamstress of the two of us . 
but she doesn't china paint 
so we both have our expertise side . 
that is excellent . 
what part of ohio are you in ? 
i'm in the suburb of cleveland 
and i'm about , uh , fifteen miles , probably , from downtown cleveland , something like that . 
and cleveland is located right on lake erie 
and prior to this , we were fifty miles west from here . 
so we were right on the lake . 
and cleveland isn't all as bad as what you've heard .
oh , what's that , 
and you do find people , uh , into the crafts and uh , various things for spare time , 
but , i have never heard and i have actually never run into anyone into the china painting 
and i'm just intrigued with it . 
if you ever start , be sure and start with i mean a large flat plate . 
um , that way you can get the feel of , 
you're not cramped on these smaller objects . 
where you're getting into the delicate work . 
that's right . 
now , where did you first get your lessons from ? 
in abilene , texas . 
through uh , an adult ed , or strictly a china type , 
she just taught china painting . 
oh , how marvelous . 
then we had so much fun there , 
i had a friend from albany , which is about thirtysix miles away , 
and we would meet every thursday morning at our instructor's home , because she did our firing for us , 
and she would help us 
and we bought lots of equipment from her , supplies 
and it was just such a delightful time . 
and then after i , 
oh , and it's so nice , 
beg pardon ? 
it must be so nice for you , now that you're retired . 
i have been a little bit negligent about it because i was so tired when i had to go to work after my husband's death . 
so i have put it aside for a little while , 
but i have just found me an instructor to get started again , 
oh , isn't that great . 
and you'll probably really , uh , regain your enthusiasm for it 
of course , i just have one beautiful with peonies , uh , umbrella stand , 
and i have two daughters 
and they're both , 
uh , what is your practice as far as budgeting ? 
do you manage the money ? 
well , we talk about it , 
but i'm usually the one that sits down and puts the pencil to the paper and tries to somehow make the ends meet , which , uh , 
oh , i see . 
that's how kind of i am , too . 
are you married ? 
um , yes . 
you are . 
i think the women for the most part end up managing the money . 
my husband always says he earns it , and i have to spend only what he earns .
i don't mind the spending , 
it's just that out of what you have . 
that seems to be our challenge . 
well , i don't work outside of the home , 
and he always threatens that when i spend more than ,
i see . 
 so i manage it .
well , i'm at home also , 
so , it does get rather interesting trying to survive on one salary , uh , 
now , do you actually follow a budget ? 
well , we pretty well do . 
um , several years we didn't , 
and we found that we just weren't making the most of what we had , 
and so we , um , set aside a certain amount each week that goes for things that have to be paid for , you know , 
just our bills . 
and then what's left we divvy up . 
we try to save a little bit , although we're not always successful , 
and then the rest of it just goes for normal weekly needs . 
well , that's pretty much the way um , or we did in the past , 
i would say . uh , 
at this point our children are grown , 
and so i really don't have the obligations there any more 
and i really just keep very good records , 
and most of our expenses are fairly the same every month with the exception of utilities and things like that , 
 uh , i don't always succeed at that . 
i usually keep one with a low interest rate , 
and i put things on there that i think i'm not going to get to 
 and then i have another one , 
but for the most part , our mortgage and our utilities at this point , we're in a new home , and , uh , they take a pretty big chunk compared to what they used to 
 so i'm still getting used to that , 
but we make sure that we just do not buy unless we really can see how we're going to pay for it ahead 
 and we do not buy us , new cars . 
uh , do you get into car , 
my husband , um , owned his own company and it went under , 
and so we could no longer afford that monthly payment , 
and now it just seems just such a large amount of money to spend that we do have a used car , 
well , he has a company car also , 
but for our personal car we have a used car . 
um , do you think that it's wiser to buy used ? 
in fact , we are in a position that most of our friends wonder why we just don't go to a new car , you know , whatever , 
and i said 
we haven't had car payments for so many years , 
i love it this way , 
and recently we just created the laugh among everyone because we had a car that we really liked 
and it has eightytwo thousand miles on it 
believe it or not , we did , we found one , one newer 
oh , no , 
the worst part is , it's the same color 
and i said , you know how when you have a bad one , you say , never again 
that's right .
i said , well , we had one , and we found one with just seventeen thousand miles on it 
 and it's an eightyfive , 
we paid for the car , 
and we still know now that we have this car to put all the miles on . 
this is for all the long running back and forth on , you know interstate driving and things , 
and we intend to replace our other one with a much newer car in the next couple of years , or next year probably . 
generally from dealers , 
and uh , it depends , because i don't like to sell what we're trading in to an individual 
 you know , we were going up to a larger one , 
but we have found that by trading in and going through a dealer , we always make a deal . 
you're going to get one shot at us 
we will , you know , 
i s , 
this is the price we're going to give you out the door . 
we don't want to hear about taxes , 
do you have children of your own ? 
oh , no , 
but i'm still going to college . 
oh , are you ? 
what school are you going to ? 
n c state . 
oh . are you enjoying it ? 
um , well , it's a lot of work .
 are you working on your , um 
my bachelor's . 
and what field of study are you in ? 
um , it's actually in computer science 
 and i have a special interest in voice i o . 
oh , well , that's neat . 
are you from north carolina ? 
oh , are you really ? 
oh . well , what took you to north carolina ? 
oh , um , the service . 
oh , i see . 
well , that was one of the things i was thinking about in school , um , 
i went to texas tech out in lubbock 
but she was from new mexico 
 and she had to pay out of state tuition 
 and i think that would have , uh , played a real big part of my decision 
 it would have played a major part in mine . 
 yeah , because , um , she was pay , 
of course back then it was so much cheaper than it is now . 
it was like four dollars a semester hour 
 and so i was going to school for , you know , just a few hundred dollars a semester , 
and she was paying forty dollars an hour 
 so she paid ten times as much because she was out of state . 
luckily i've paid in state tuition the whole time . 
oh , that's good . 
so i think that would be one thing i would definitely consider 
uhhuh , um , 
the second thing is some colleges only offer the , uh , liberal arts 
 so depending on what your major is , or medical , you might want to um , attend somewhere like tech 
 and , um , aside from the , uh , 
well some schools may even give you financial aid , where another one won't . 
that's true , 
that was something else i had , was , i had government aid , of course , 
but , uh , it was wonderful , because i got one of those grants that you don't have to repay 
oh , really . 
 and , yeah , 
it was so nice 
it paid most of my tuition , and , um , a lot of the book costs and that kind of thing 
wow , that's great . 
i really , 
was it a pell grant ? 
i'm sorry , what did you say ? 
what kind of grant was it ? 
well , it was called a b e o g , a basic equal opportunity grant 
 and it was from the government , 
and at first it was based on my parents' income . 
my parents had five children and really didn't make enough money to send any of us to school . 
and so , uh , because based on the number of children and the amount of money , uh , my father brought in , i got a small grant 
 but then after that , i was on my own , working and , you know , trying to go to school on my own . 
so then i got a real big grant , because the 
so , it was kind of nice . 
i don't know if those are still available or not , 
uh , i'm not quite , 
uh , who do give grants , 
but , uh , i'm not exactly sure which ones they are and how much , you know , they generally run . 
this was great , 
it was just based on , you know , how much your tuition costs and everything , 
and generally it paid everything , 
so that was , 
golly , that's great . 
it was really nice . 
i've got a degree from another college 
 and , uh , something that might play a part is the size of the college . 
uh ,   the smaller schools can give you uh , a lot more specialized instruction 
in the larger schools you get caught up in the bureaucracy , 
instead of a scholar you get a t a 
that's right . 
 and , uh , you don't get near the , uh , quality of education  , 
and as well , the , uh , smaller schools often times don't cost as much . 
um , i didn't know that . 
oh , yeah . 
um . well , i guess the only comparison i had ever heard was between a christian college , because i thought about attending abilene christian 
 and of course the price was just astronomical compared to tech 
the christian college was so much more expensive . 
but i guess some of the other smaller colleges might be a lot different . 
it's really a shame because of , you know , the instruction 
 um , i'd rather go to any other college , you know , in the state , 
and i would definitely get my money's worth , uh , much better than state . 
yeah , huh . 
it's kind of unfortunate , because they've just grown so big that they just don't care about the students any more . 
you're just a number . 
uh , how much of the campus they can build up 
 and , uh 
it's really a bad situation here . 
oh , that's a shame . 
well , i felt a little cheated at tech , also . 
once i got into my , 
i , um , majored in , 
the major change that's been going on ? 
that's a tough question . 
we are now able to work full eight hours a day and still do our housework . right .
don't ask me . 
 i think that has been the major change , is that , women feel they need to go out and do this , 
to stay home and raise your family 
i know it , 
and i think that's really sad , because i think there's going to be a generation of kids that are going to grow up raised by somebody else . 
well , i'm a school teacher , 
and i'm in charge of raising them , 
so i can appreciate it . 
you don't , well  , 
with my last one , 
and i wouldn't change a minute of it for anything .
oh , good for you , 
but , i can't help but think that eventually the pendulum's going to swing back the other way again . 
well , you know , it's interesting , because when i heard the topic , i was thinking , uh , 
this summer oprah had a t v show 
and one woman had four children , 
and her husband said she wasn't pulling her own weight in the family 
oh , yeah , 
that's frightening 
it's sad , 
 and , you know , it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a social issue , you know 
and nobody would give her credit for being 
i think too many people feel they need to live a more extravagant lifestyle than necessary 
that's true . 
 uh , you know , to , 
and this type of thing . 
i think that they would from the , you know , attention or whatever 
that's true . 
 uh , but , it , 
i don't know , 
i see it as a major problem 
and i think it's going to have to swing back the other way , because i think we're going to have an awful lot of kids who are going to have major problems from all this . 
well , you know , as i said , i teach school 
 and , gosh , i'm trying to think , 
i don't know , 
i have one mother that i know is home , 
but she also has ten children . 
what grade do you teach ? 
six , seven and eight . 
six , seven and eight . 
i've got a chi , uh , 
where do you live ? 
are you out , 
in richardson . 
in richardson , 
we're in plano here . 
oh , okay . 
i have a daughter in middle school , 
and , uh , i know there aren't very many , 
she has a few friends that have moms who are still at home , 
but do you ever see problems , you know , that you feel 
oh , yeah . 
i've got one child , um , that stays with me every day until five , because his mother doesn't come home until seven , 
and he doesn't want to be home from three thirty until seven by himself . 
he stays at school ? 
and the school allows that ? 
 and i have a tendency to work late . 
i work until six 
 so he stays with me until five thirty and then goes home 
oh , my , 
 and , you know , i have lots of kids , because they know i'm there late 
i'm a slow mover to say the least , 
and that's frightening , because , you know , the , 
when i said i'm raising them , i am , 
because we're talking about boy friends 
and we're talking about what the girl said in class , 
and , you know , what's right 
no mother to talk to . 
 and , um , it makes a difference , 
and just the social values , 
well , i've just , 
do you feel it will swing back the other way , 
or do you feel there's just going to be a big push uh 
i don't know . 
i have a feeling we're going to go more and more , 
i've got a twentyone year old female , 
and i've got twentytwo year old male children , 
and i listen to my daughter , 
and she's going to work , 
and she's going to buy her house , 
and she's going to get her car , 
and then she's going to have her children , 
and then when , you know , they go on one salary , will they be able to sustain what 
and they're back to work , 
and , you know , i agree with you , 
i was raised in a generation we didn't need all those things 
 and we lived without them , 
we did fine , 
i've got a , you know , 
i have a real good method of starting to get the budget balancing 
and then that's get rid of the half of the government payroll . 
i think that would probably , uh , be very possible , 
and we really wouldn't feel it in our services .
not all , 
you know , i don't know if you've ever been to washington d c . 
uh , you've seen that which was on there and the offices 
and in light of these , uh , hearings we've all been sitting through the last two weeks , we have very definitely decided that every department there is just overstaffed . 
they really don't have enough to keep them busy to keep their noses in their own business of what they're doing . 
and the other thing is , uh , besides that i think , uh , two things that very definitely need looking at , one is foreign aid . 
i have a real problem with all the foreign aid that is going to the countries that really have no use for us . 
i find that a total waste and part of the defense budget . 
uh , again being just a voter and a taxpayer , you know , working through our congressman , i don't think there's too much that i'm going to be able to do about it , 
but i believe in taking an active part in politics , 
well , i , 
beyond cutting what they spend is that just really aggravates me when the big businesses do not end up paying taxes 
and the , um , regular normal taxpayers are , you know 
and then the , uh , corporate , you know , industries just don't seem to not pay proportionally . 
i think that that would help a lot . 
i guess in a way it would trickle down to us in the prices of things , 
but hard to take and , you know , see so much of our paycheck go out and then realize that they have all the loopholes that they can use . 
and , uh , seems like some rather large chunks of money could come from that direction . 
they don't seem to , well , 
i really think the biggest problem 
and then the  taftrudman  act is supposed to help that . 
the biggest part is they have no accountability for what they're doing . 
i mean this nonsense that's coming through now about , uh , uh , lowering payments on social security and a few other things that bush has in mind in order it's ridiculous . 
if they don't have that money now , bringing in less is not going to help the problem 
not going to help . 
it's my personal situation .
and thank god we don't operate our budget ,
 amen  .
but that's , uh , 
i don't know what we're going to be able to do about it 
but i guess it's sitting around so long that it's sort of like our mortgages . 
i don't ever expect to pay mine off before i die 
so i guess why .
that's the way they're thinking these days anyway . 
it seems to be . 
you know , i , 
it really does bother me when i think about , you know , leaving our children an answer to it , uh , 
i don't know . 
i don't think it ever will really . 
maybe if they ever get to the point you know , the biggest  outlaid  expense has always been either wars or defense . 
if they were to take half of what they spend on that and put it on some economic , you know , intergovernmental or inter united states like programs that one really might . 
i believe in paying my share , 
and i don't mind , uh , paying for some of these fringe benefits that people are entitled to . 
but i just sometimes feel like i'm being used . 
but , uh , again i don't think we'll be able to do anything about it , 
well , that's quite possible . 
i guess we have to keep plugging away a little bit 
or it will just totally get even more out of control 
but i don't know . 
bite the bullet . 
it sounds like you have a baby there . 
she's a , 
we're not feeling too well over here 
so that , 
oh , really ? 
oh , that's a shame . 
i don't think i could part with her . 
so it was nice talking to you . 
well , thanks . 
what's your favorite t v show ? 
oh . you know , i used to like st . elsewhere . 
that's one of my old favorites . 
um , and that's , 
i'm being beeped , 
so i'll just ignore it . 
um , and now , i did like thirty something 
 oh , yes , 
my daughter says nine oh two one oh . 
we like that one . 
that's one of my favorites . 
and how old are you ? 
i'm twentyeight . 
oh , so you're little bit younger than i am , 
but yeah , 
i think if my seventeen year old , my fourteen year old , my other two children like it , 
i'm over forty , 
and i like it . 
i think it's wonderful . 
it's a good show . 
i like murphy brown and designing women , too . 
 oh , yeah , 
now see , we are so busy with , all of our kids are in sports , 
and i hardly ever watch t v , 
but that's one that we watch . 
and then sunday nights we watch , uh , life goes on . 
i like that , 
that's a good show , too . 
very good . 
did you see the one on sunday ? 
it was a , uh , uh 
i did miss that sunday , 
that one kid that becca likes 
it's a good episode . 
the new character on there did . 
all the way to north carolina . 
what time is it there ? 
uh , it is twenty minutes to nine . 
oh , my gosh . 
see , i'm twenty minutes to six here .
three hours difference . 
what else do you like ? 
uh , let's see , i like a lot of different shows . 
let's see , um , i like murder , she wrote . 
oh , i never watched that ever in my entire life . 
and matlock is another good one i watch . 
um , then during daytimes i like all my children . 
a small bowl will be plenty . 
oh , that's mine . 
that's the only one i watch whenever i , oh , 
a small bowl will be better because it's pretty fattening . 
talk to my daughter . 
um , um , 
all my children , 
i've watched that for about twelve years . 
i'm sure i watched it for more than that probably . 
twenty something . 
i used to watch general hospital when i was a teenager because i , 
i quit watching general hospital when leslie got killed . 
so that was a long time ago . 
i used to watch it , in high school and college 
she was my favorite character on there . 
i just , 
i read the reason they killed her off was because they couldn't settle a contract , 
and i said , well , if they're going to do that to her , i won't watch it . 
 oh , that's great . 
well , i do like all my children , 
and i like it , you know , i don't know . 
i just , 
i like the people on it , i guess , you know . 
i like it . 
i just wish they'd bring some of the old characters back . 
he'll come back , show up at just the right moment . 
i kind of wish that , uh , nina would come back because she 
just for a brief visit or whatever , because it never has been resolved with palmer remarrying , and everything , 
like daisy , pops in once in a while , 
and , i forgot about nina and cliff , right . 
cliff's on the young and the restless now . 
oh , he is . 
so he's out for good . 
did they marry ? 
nina and cliff ? 
that's how they left the show , but not in real life . 
now she's married to some guy in new york , 
and she's happily married 
and that's the reason she left the show . 
i guess she wanted a private life . 
oh , okay , 
oh , see i watch it maybe twice a month , 
so , i don't watch it everyday like i did when i had babies . 
oh , well , i watch . 
because i play lots of tennis 
and i'm gone a lot , 
so , i don't get to watch , 
i watch it everyday , religiously . 
i videotape it when i have to miss it . 
oh , no kidding . 
i used to be like that .
i'm that way about a lot of different shows . 
i'm that way about murphy brown , designing women . 
now instead of what's her name ? 
uh , yeah , 
there's two new characters on there . 
there's , um , uh , jan hooks from saturday night life . 
i don't know if you know her or not . 
and then , uh ,  , uh , the blond headed girl that used to be on newhart . 
oh , yeah , oh . 
i don't like her on it , 
i never have liked her , 
well , i just know which one she is . 
i don't , you know . 
she's taken the suzanne's part , 
and then jan hooks has taken charlene's part . 
charlene was delta burke ? 
oh , okay , 
well , see , i never watch that one either . 
i really don't watch a whole lot of t v , just , you know , on sunday nights , 
life goes on comes on about the time that we eat dinner , 
and my whole family's home , because i don't allow the kids out on sunday night 
and so we sit around and eat popcorn 
and , oh , then we watch america's funniest home videos . 
those are always pretty cute . 
well , murder , she wrote comes on opposite of that , 
and so , 
oh , so you don't watch that one 
we like that real well . 
be sure to watch it tomorrow night 
i know . 
the kids already know who it is , 
i don't know who it is , though , 
who is it ? 
ask them .
uh , you hit , uh , 
it doesn't matter . 
i suppose i should have , 
uh , which 
i am pro capital punishment except that i don't like the way it's done . 
uh , yeah , 
uh , i hate to see anyone die , uh 
 but , uh , i guess these people that go around to live and be supported by us the rest of their lives . 
i agree . 
capital punishment is necessary in many cases 
but , uh , the , 
it's not a deterrent , um , or our jails would not be so full . 
there wouldn't be so many people in death row . 
i think it needs to be something , uh , uh , a throwback to where they did a , uh , public execution where it's visible . 
uh , something , you know , not gruesome 
it was a deterrent and it was equal for all people . 
if you committed a certain crime , you were going to receive a death penalty 
and it was going to happen to you . 
no stays of execution . 
no loopholes , 
well , and even that i don't really know if that would help . 
i think a lot of these people do it , uh , mainly because of , of t v 
and , a , 
the double reason of notoriety . 
i mean , they become well known . 
they are almost like a big star . 
they know that their chances of actually receiving the death penalty are minimal . 
they know that they will probably be out in ten to twelve years . 
that they are going to write a book . 
they are going to go on talk shows 
they're goin , 
that's a reward 
in complete , uh , 
  of any notoriety . 
uh , you take a life you give yours . 
uh , uh , that's for sure . 
uh , there's exceptions to the rule 
i mean if it's an accidental taking then , uh , you look at that 
but , you know , most of these people that down right go right and do it out of pure pleasure 
i guess also the fact that they say it's not a deterrent , 
it is a deterrent in the sense that that person will never do it again .
well , yes , 
they will . 
oh ,    , 
well , that's correct , 
if he indeed receives 
the death penalty . 
the chances are not great that that will happen . 
but there's a greater chance that he'll be back out on the streets in twelve years . 
well , i guess i'm also looking at beyond even that . 
i guess i been thinking about it 
and i don't have a definite opinion 
but , uh , repeat , uh , crimes 
that's right . 
just for pleasure too 
do they deserve to , uh , remain on this earth too ? 
why , you know , uh , if they are a repeat offender 
 and you know that as soon as you let them out on the streets they are going to do this . 
unfortunately the way our system of jurisprudence is set up , um , you only receive the death penalty for capital crimes , 
 and of course  uh , of battery or assault or , that is not a capital crime see . 
you wouldn't be able to under our system . 
now china and a few other countries have a little different view of that . 
um , you get caught with dope there and you die , period . 
no appeals . 
there is no , 
well , i don't know what to do about the federal budget . 
um , there certainly have been ideas surfaced , uh , recently , uh , matter of fact repeatedly by many people 
and i sort of wondered what thoughts you had on that area . 
when we're talking in trillions of dollars .
and the people that are talking this numbers have no concept of what that number means . 
now are you talking about the elected people 
or are you talking about others ? 
the elected people . 
and what's going to be done with those monies 
uh , we need to elect people that are more , uh , 
or  . . . 
i'm not sure how you would ach , 
how would you achieve that ? 
i mean if , 
well , uh , or economics . 
so you would trust the decision making economists ? 
sometimes called the dismal science . 
that understand the value of a dollar , 
um , and wh , 
the , uh , lobbyists ,
they don't make pragmatic decisions . 
they make a decision based on constituency 
um , you know , that is not good for the country . 
 so you would favor a law which said there could not be lobbyists . 
i mean right now lobbyists require to register you'd just say ,
get rid of them . 
totally . uh , 
no causes that you think the lobbyists would be good for ? 
i think that any company or anything that wants to contribute to a fund 
but they should not have a oneonone relationship with the people making the decisions that affect them . 
that's a conflict of interest as far as i'm concerned . 
when you are talking again , uh , billions and trillions of dollars 
so , uh , you talk about jeopardizing the future . 
would you be against any deficit spending ? 
you can't ease into it . 
it took years and years to build up the momentum that's there now . 
uh , i forget the figures on the interest rate 
but it's something like , uh , hundreds of thousands of dollars a second 
part of the problem is we don't loan from ourselves . 
we buy from intimate international banking . 
that's why we have interest . 
that we don't want to put the brakes on them . 
but could one take ? um , 
that is reasonable . 
well , but everybody will say that he is for that . uh , 
 oh , of course . 
 sure  .
 and then add on to it . 
you take the gross national income 
one thing we could do is give a ten percent income tax .
everyone no matter what ,
sounds like a good idea . 
no , 
just ten percent . 
you pay a ten percent income tax . 
that's what you pay 
if you make forty million dollars , uh , then you're going to pay four million . 
if you make forty dollars , you're going to pay four dollars . 
and that's it . 
so that's it . 
that's i mean 
i agree with that 
that's a good idea 
well , what's your favorite baseball team , rita ? 
is that what i , 
is the million dollar question here ? 
well , that isn't a true false or right or wrong test here . 
uh , uh , you know , i would like to say the rangers , 
but unfortunately they're not . 
i was from illinois , 
and my favorite team was the white sox . 
but i turned out to be a white sox fan . 
well , that's all right . 
i lived in chicago . 
how do you expect them to do this year ? 
they did pretty well . 
what did you think of the world series ? 
well , i'll tell you . 
i just , uh , moved down from south dakota in july , 
and , uh , in south dakota , the minnesota twins are the closest professional sports team to where i was living 
 and so everybody was a twins fan , 
and i uh , didn't have much interest in the twins , you know , 
it was kind of pathetic , i mean , 
we only had two radio stations , 
and one of them broadcast every twins game live , you know , 
 and the other one was country . 
there's was twins there , or , you know 
or country . 
oh , uh , and i was routing for the twins myself because , uh , a couple of ranger players that i had watched when we first moved here , uh , went to minnesota , 
and we used to tease my son 
and i used to have a bet going about some of the players that had moved from here to minnesota , 
but it certainly was an exciting series , anyway . 
it sure was , 
what do you think going to happen to the rangers ? 
well , i 
or can we predict ? 
i was sure hopeful anyway . 
when we moved down , uh , i was able to go to my first , you know baseball game , and 
so i became a rangers fan . 
i didn't really have one in south dakota . 
so i adopted the rangers , 
or rather they adopted me , i guess 
 and , uh , it was just exciting , you know , 
you can watch baseball on t v 
and they hit the long ball , 
and it looks like wow , they really hit that ball . 
but when you go to the ball park , it's really not all that far 
and it's so much more exciting watching a ball come at you , 
you know , but , oh , i think going to the ball park just really makes it . because then you watch it on t v you feel like you're more a part of it too . 
that's right , 
well , i'm a great sports enthusiast , 
so i love , you know , baseball teams , 
and they , 
in fact , on the news tonight , nolan ryan was on there . 
which i never knew existed , the restaurant hall of fame .
the restaurant ha , 
the restaurant hall of fame inducted him tonight , 
he doesn't know how many years 
he'll be at least one more , 
and he said he's been saying one more , and it's been two and three , might be two and three more . 
he likes it . 
that's right 
 and he's still doing great 
that's right . 
you know , and he said , i get a kick out of it , you know , 
he's such a nice man . 
well , didn't he just sign a twelve year contract with the rangers ? 
and he , 
you know when he quits at being active , he will go into , you know 
but , uh , he certainly is a good example , uh , for the kids . 
that's right . 
you know , you like to have someone like that you could point to say , see what a fine man , that , he is . 
you know , some of the , 
like , uh , ivan rodriguez wasn't even born when , uh , nolan ryan started pitching . 
that's right . 
and it's just incredible to think that uh , there are players who are the sons of ball players that used to play against nolan 
and now their sons are . 
oh , he's been a legend for so many years , you know , 
and i don't know , 
had you moved here yet when he did the exhibition at u t with his son . 
his son pitched for u t 
and he pitched for an exhibition game for the rangers . 
it was a , 
i think it was a little early part of the summer , 
and uh , 
was it nolan against , uh 
well that is neat . 
 and , uh , only , uh , ryan didn't want too much publicity on it because he didn't want his son getting too nervous about this whole thing . 
a game is a game , you know . 
well , the rangers really , uh , knocked the socks off of them , which you would expect 
but nolan i think took himself out after a couple of innings or something , you know , of the game 
well , how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
 well , i just last friday got off a capital murder case . 
oh , you did ? 
oh , really  ? 
uh , how do i feel about it ? 
i don't know . 
well , i guess it is right in certain cases . uh , 
well , the one i was just on , i don't , 
i was an alternate on the case , 
so i don't know what was decided . 
they are probably still in deliberations on it . 
but , uh , what i found out , 
once i was declared an alternate and i was dismissed , we met with the judge , the two alternates did . 
and , uh , he went on to tell us how they happened to catch this guy 
and i remember hearing about it . 
it was about a year ago . 
uh , another capital murder the very next month 
and he was caught just , 
they drove up , 
the police drove up just as he fired the gun and killed the guy . 
oh , wow . 
so he was caught 
and , uh , it's interesting because the county i live in , 
i'm not in dallas county , 
i'm pretty far north of dallas . 
uh , county i live two capital murders . 
and last year there were six 
and this guy is indicted on three of them . 
well , the cases like that , they 
i mean , if he's going to be drastic , somebody has to be drastic back . 
although , you know , it's not really revenge because it doesn't mean anything to him . 
you know , he has no concept of what he has done . 
he just , well , 
from what i can tell . i mean , i didn't talk to the guy or anything , 
so , it's kind of strange that , you know , 
well , i guess in cases like you know , where the guy would , obviously , go out and do it again 
well , it's funny because when , you know , they interview you before you go on the jury 
and i , 
i was the , i think the ninety eighth person they'd interviewed . 
you're kidding . 
but , you know at the time when the guy kept saying could you ever convict someone 
and do you think you'd ever know beyond a doubt 
and i said i can't imagine , 
i said if i knew beyond a doubt or if i felt beyond a doubt that he had done it , yeah , 
i guess i could convict him , 
but i can't imagine you ever making me that sure of something . 
but they really did . 
it was 
well , i guess if the police came out and saw him fire the gun , 
well , that was a subsequent case that we didn't know about .
oh , really ? 
but this particular case , i mean , they had a complete confession from the guy 
so no one else would have known . 
it was really pretty interesting . 
i guess cases like that , i don't see why they wouldn't bring in the new evidence from the other case . 
well , they can , i think in the punishment phase 
of that crime 
 but he was found guilty of anoth , 
that works . 
well , they pushing the death penalty ? 
uh , yeah , 
uh , and in texas there is a couple of questions you have to ask , uh , in the punishment phase . 
uh , for example , was the guy provoked and was the response reasonable given the provocation .
and there is a number of questions 
and just depending on whether you say yes or no , uh , you can give him capital punishment 
and if you're up to the point where if he still qualifies for capital punishment , then you can look at mitigating circumstances . 
so there is a lot of outs , 
but the only result is , otherwise he gets life in prison . 
and i'm really kind of against life in prison anyway 
 and to me , i mean , you take away a person's freedom , you've taken away most of their life . 
that's true . 
i mean , if you're going to put him in prison for life 
but then you have to look at reality . 
i mean , i think , you know , normally they may get out 
that's true . 
but what is it worth ? 
i don't know . 
personally i don't know which i would pick if i had a choice for myself . 
that's true . 
i mean , i don't know whether i'd stay in prison or not 
so , you said you're from mississippi ? 
yes , ma'am . 
and do they have the death penalty there ? 
they've had a number of cases here . 
i mean , not a whole lot , 
well , jackson , i heard just the other day had their sixtyfirst murder this year . 
it was like last like year they had fortynine 
so that's going up . 
they have a death penalty . 
i hear of one every now and then . 
and i visited the prison up here 
and i've been , 
i haven't , 
they won't let you on death row , 
but they'll let you look down the hall . 
you can't see any prisoners 
 and it's kind of a weird feeling . 
i've been 
they took us around on a tour , you know , 
 and i got to walk in the gas chamber 
 and it is kind of a weird feeling knowing you're sitting there saying , like , people have died here . 
that's right . 
but i guess , just going up there and seeing the surroundings and stuff , the people up there , 
well , uh , let's see , 
what type of car do i want ? 
well , i'd like to have a corvette . 
oh , wow . 
apply for me to have that kind of car , 
 uh , i'm engaged to get married 
so , i'll more likely get a car for economic reasons . 
uh , so , uh , to drive back and forth to work is all i'll need a car for pretty much . 
and we have a truck , 
so probably a economic size car or , uh , 
what kind of a car do you have now ? 
right now i have a eightyseven cavalier . 
it's a piece of  , 
my car is really old , too , 
because , uh , i drive out of town a lot of the weekends 
 and , uh , i would like my next car to have good gas mileage . 
and , uh , same here , uh , 
you know , a nice car , american made 
and , uh , you know , a nice car , but not too expensive , 
because , uh , i couldn't afford like a brand new like lamborghini .
i hardly drive , 
but while we're talking , 
while we're talking , my next car , i'd like to be sporty and , you know 
but , you know , it's expensive 
and then insurance is really high for that , too 
oh , i know . 
that insurance does come into play . 
i forgot about that . 
what kind of insurance do you have up there 
or is it real high up there ? 
uh , no 
and , uh , i'm not sure really how much i pay . 
i just , 
my mom's helping me out , you know , because i'm in college 
uh , so i just give her the money 
i mean that insurance is high dollars . 
it is , 
and the more expensive the car , the higher it is 
i don't plan on buying a car for many , many years 
i have to make this one last as long as i can . 
what's everybody drive up there ? 
uh , in kenosha ? .
oh , it just is , 
or , do you all need four wheel drives up there because of snow and everything ? 
it never snows down here , 
 well , we don't have any snow here now . 
it all melted . 
there is no snow at all . 
we haven't had snow yet . 
we usually only get like once a year or so . 
because , how , 
it's like seventy degrees here right now . 
oh , don't tell me that .
how cold is it there ? 
well , actually , it's been warm , 
it's in the forties . 
and that's really warm . 
uh , and it's supposed to rain tomorrow 
so we , 
i've only seen snow once this year . 
and it was really bad 
and then it all melted like within the week . 
and now there is no snow , 
but , um , so what is your dream car ? 
uh , i haven't really thought about it . 
i'm not too big on cars . 
i mean , i don't know the names and stuff , 
but if i were to go to a car lot and like look at them 
what's your favorite color ? 
uh , for a car ? 
probably blue .
but if i were to get a sports car , maybe white or red .
right  , 
so , what kind of car do you drive right now ? 
uh , it's a sky hawk buick . 
i think . 
i'm afraid it's not going to last me that long 
and i hope it does , though . 
it's a two door . 
i like smaller cars . 
i find them more comfortable to drive . 
does everybody have their windows tinted up there ? 
uh , no , 
everybody has tinted down here . 
oh , i'm sure , 
i could see why . 
so , you been down here before ? 
did you like it ? 
it was busy .
it's different 
it was nice . 
i remember , uh , swimming on easter day 
and it was like really cold up here , 
so that was nice .
it's like , you know , 
everybody freaks out when it sn , 
well , i guess , 
which one have you got right now ? 
well , i , uh , 
couple of them , 
i , at the moment , use an a s t two eightysix 
and i got a leading edge 
and i got a american one and had a i b m one , 
just a couple . 
what do you have  ? 
uh , i've got an omega 
and i've got a , uh , generic three eighty , or four eightysix machine . 
oh , yeah ? 
what did you do , put it together ? 
well , that's , 
that's all i got to say for it . 
what do you use it for ? 
what do you use it for ? 
uh , work , 
uh , i'm a contract programmer . 
oh , yeah ? 
what kind of programs do you , 
uh , anything .
i mean like business programs 
uh , i've done business programming , you know , scientific applications like , you know , petroleum science stuff and ,
and touch screen for a company that sells , uh , touch screens . 
it was kind of fun . 
put a little bitty portable computer in there and a plasma display .
well , that's , 
 well , that sounds interesting . 
matter of fact , uh , i guess uh , you get a lot of graphics in there , i imagine , huh . 
oh , yeah , 
that's where the speed helps out . 
uh , yeah , 
unfortunately the little portable p c that was plugged on the back was only a seven and a half megahertz , eightysix . 
it's like slow .
that will , 
well , i do , uh , uh , programming for c n c turret presses and 
and , uh , really need a faster system . 
uh , i got a new line that i sell metal fabricating equipment , and cat cam systems , and tooling , et cetera . 
i know a guy that upgrades , uh , for a reasonable cost . 
who is that ? 
 uh , his name is t q or something like that . 
and my notebook is somewhere around here .
see if i can make my telephone cord stretch far enough . 
i've tried to do is get this outfit to 
uh , he's , uh , up in , 
that's how i got my other ones by selling their product for them . 
they not only give me a demonstrator , but the hardware as well as the software . 
and as they , 
oh , that works . 
that's why i have so many different levels of p c s around at the moment . 
uh , here it is . 
a t s computers . 
a t s ? 
and where are they at ? 
uh , do you know where , uh , custer is ? 
oh , yeah . 
he's , uh , uh , south of renner on custer . 
and there is a little bitty mall that looks kind of like , strip kind of center . 
in richardson there . 
in richardson ? 
i know where you mean . 
there is a mobil and all that kind of s , uh , on that one corner , 
it's just south of there . 
it's a little place , looks like a castle . 
kind of , uh , little guy in there . 
he , uh , gives reasonable prices . 
like i traded my , uh , three eightysix for the four eightysix for about six hundred . 
well , that's a good deal . 
it was pretty reasonable . 
but , uh , uh , he , 
and he does a good job 
and he , uh , guarantees everything he sells . 
uh , there is a lot , 
you ever go by lucky computer there ? 
i used to , 
when i was putting shop floor computers together for guys , i'd go and get their units and put them together and go and interface the stuff with our systems . 
haven't been doing much of that for the last year or so . 
so i don't know where those guys are at these days . 
but i ,    , 
uh , they're up there in that mall . uh , just below campbell .
they're still doing business . big business , apparently . 
i tell you , those prices have just , unbelievably come down . 
oh , yeah , 
i was amazed i was able to get this four eightysix for six hundred even with a trade in , 
you know , it's like , wow .
that works , 
i'll go do that .
and boy that thing screams now . 
i was kind of surprised how rapidly they bypassed ,
that wasn't alive for but maybe two years . 
well , i thought was funny that they kept pushing the three eightysix s x even though the price difference is about ten dollars . 
is that right ? 
that's it ? 
i'll be darned . 
huh , well , 
our most recent series of projects i guess , inside was , uh , we remodeled a bathroom recently . 
well , how did it go ? 
well , it went pretty well , uh , other than the fact that we encountered some , uh , problems that you run across in older homes with plumbing , which one thing led to another , 
and eventually we ended up replacing all the pipes from the sink clear back to the main drain .
gee , like starting over , i guess . 
it wasn't one of those , 
it started out as a sunday project 
 and by the next sunday it was done . 
it wasn't a one dayer . 
believe me . 
boy , that sounds like , uh , 
course , uh , i don't know , 
once you get it done , then you probably won't have that problem again . 
it's good for another thirty years . 
um , you've got an older house ? 
they are built a little bit more sturdy than  , 
well , that's the thing that surprised me , because once i got into the plumbing 
and it was all soldered . 
oh , is that right . 
and nothing wanted to go , 
so it was like i had to go all the way back to the main drain and start all over . 
and just start at square one . 
that was an all day job , just to get it plumbed . 
well , and then if you do it wrong .
i was very fortunate , uh , in the fact that , uh , when i made the installation of the sink and everything bolted up and we turned the water on 
everything went all right . 
everything worked . 
i appreciate it . 
that's the type of thing you cross your fingers and are glad when that happens . 
well , i expected something to leak , you know 
but it all came together , 
so i felt pretty fortunate about that . 
all worked out all right , huh . 
how about you ? 
um , well probably the last thing i did was , uh , paint and wallpaper kids room 
 and , uh , i learned to , 
i used the wrong kind of paint . 
this must have not been a very good quality , because it just hasn't stood up very well . 
what kind of paint ? 
it was a latex paint , 
it was flat 
 and i wonder if maybe i should have used a gloss . 
uh , but they say you ought to use your gloss mainly in your 
that , and semigloss for trim work , and usually flat for walls . 
but i think maybe , uh , 
i don't know if it was just the . 
was it not washable paint ? 
well , it is a latex paint , 
but it just kind of is , 
you're supposed to be able to wash it 
 but it , um , just looks dingy . 
i don't know how else to explain it . 
what color is it ? 
it's pink . 
pink , 
it's kind of got , uh , oh , just kind of a worn look to it . 
i don't know even how to say , 
just didn't turn out quite as nice as i would have liked 
did you , uh , require more than one can of paint ? 
we put two coats on it , 
and it's a small room , 
but i think it only took one , uh , can . 
we did , uh , oh , 
you do mix the color as far as you start with , uh , white 
you know what i'm saying 
but you only had one can of paint that you 
and then i wall papered a couple of walls , 
and , uh . 
how'd that go ? 
well , that was the first time i've ever wallpapered , 
 and , uh , 
that's an education in itself . 
but , uh , the dye lots , uh , must have been a little bit different from , 
first of all it takes quite a few rolls , even a small room , if you're trying to match a design . 
repeating patterns is what you have to check for 
that's what i needed , 
and i didn't think about that . 
i got a mickey mouse print is what i got . 
and so a lot is wasted . 
normally it will tell you on the roll how often a pattern repeats . 
so you know how . 
see , i didn't even think to look for that . 
and then the , 
one of them was just a different color pink , is what it ended up being . 
and   .
when you did your papering did you start in the middle of the wall ? 
or did you start at the edge ? 
is that how you're supposed to do ? 
i started at one edge and went over , 
then you had to cut around the closet 
 but , uh , 
i've had my best luck in papering when i start in the middle of a wall , 
and i'll start with a plumb line .
and start right there . 
do you seem to get it straighter , 
is that the advantage , 
or what's the , 
well , you , 
do you have any children ? 
twelve and sixteen . 
how about you ? 
well , i have three , 
and , uh , they're five and three and nineteen months . 
so we kind of got different ball game 
but , uh . 
what , uh , 
do you feel like you have any time ,
they're probably at an age where they don't want to spend any time with their parents . 
that's true .
you actually , of course , spend less time with them when they get older , 
but it's , of course , still really important . 
i have a kind of a fortunate situation , i think , right now with my sixteen year old . 
um , i work two nights a week at a , 
i'm a librarian 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and i work two nights a week at the senior high school library . 
they keep it open , you know , for kids to do their work 
the school district hires an aide , you know , to work 
well , my son is my aide . 
oh , well , that's nice . 
 so , two nights a week for four hours we're stuck together 
 and there's usually not very much business . 
i mean , some nights it's just real quiet . 
i would suspect your nights would be pretty quiet for the most part . 
so i have sort of a captive audience , 
so i really do spend probably more time with him than most , you know . 
but , uh , of course i'm away from my other son those hours , too . 
but his dad's at home 
and so that 
that's true , 
gives him a little bit of that individual time . 
but it is hard , once they get that age , 
i mean , their friends are the most important thing there is . 
and they want to be able to spend , uh . 
that's right . 
well , i've even noticed that with my five year old . she started kindergarten this year , 
 and that kind of 
it's kind of hard . 
it's hard , 
i think , uh , i find myself getting my little projects going and not taking the time that i should .
i'm more worried about , oh , 
i didn't this done , 
i didn't get , 
the kitchen needs to be cleaned 
this needs to be done , 
that's true . 
but that's kind of hard to do , you know . 
it is hard to do , 
you don't see yourself getting . 
well , if you're kind of a person that likes things , you know , organized or neat 
 or , you know 
then i think it is hard . 
it's , um , 
i think one of the nice things about holidays is that , you know , it does give you the opportunity to spend more time 
slow down a little bit . 
we often go to illinois 
oh , uhhuh . 
and we're not this year , 
and it's just really nice because we can do , you know , the things you want to do . 
you can do , uh , more than 
this is the first year we're staying home , too , 
and , uh , i think it's going to be real quiet 
but , uh , that's an opportunity to get out the games 
see , we usually do that , 
my kids even have already gotten out , um , 
my twelve year old got out the legos 
of course . 
those hard kind , 
you know , and he wants to be an engineer , 
so he still likes 
oh , yeah . 
and , um , we have the train , 
and we haven't had that lego train together for years , 
um , so he sat down , 
and i told him i really wanted him to build the train , 
and we would put it under the tree , and that i would keep it together , 
i wouldn't take it apart 
wouldn't take it apart after that . 
and every year i'd have the lego train under the tree . 
that'd be kind of fun . 
um , so he worked on that for the longest time , ever since school was out on friday , 
and , um , then his sixteen year old brother started helping , too , you know . 
you know , these are kind of things like during the normal rat race 
right . 
those kinds of things never happen 
in fact in , i think if people would learn to turn off the t v s 
i think that's a lot of the breakdown of the communication 
which is , 
usually people are not sitting in front of that . 
and there's always a few people in the family that , when they stare at it , you know , they're totally turned off to everything else . 
the rest of . 
and you can't communicate while you're doing that , right ? 
that's right . 
whereas , uh , i'm the type of person , i could not sit , well , 
i shouldn't say i could not , 
but be very hard for me to sit down and watch a program all the way through without 
me too . 
because they talk so much , 
isn't that the , 
they talk about t v shows , 
and i , huh , 
and , uh , 
 it's the best show on , 
i don't know . 
they need to have a highlight in the newspaper or something tell us what's , 
uh , what do you think about it ? 
uh , i think it's a real good concept . 
uh , drug testing procedures would have to be refined . 
from what i've seen on the news  , there's a pretty good size problem with poor accuracy , poor procedure in , uh , drug testing . 
oh , i didn't realize that . 
uh , there have been people who have been turned down for jobs because there was a drug showed up in their , uh , test , 
but they didn't know for sure what it was , 
but it was a drug , 
so they got turned down 
and , uh , turns out it was a prescription . or people getting somebody else's blood test . 
same sort of problem that happens 
that's right , 
i have heard , 
uh , i don't remember what they call it , sort of like a positive , negatives or uh , a positive indication of drugs , 
but there weren't really any there . 
uh , every now and then there's an error 
and people are really upset about that when it comes to their rights and their rights being violated . 
oh , yeah . 
i work here at texas instruments 
so , uh , let me think , do we , yeah , everyone coming in . 
i guess i did three years ago . 
everyone coming in , uh , goes through the drug testing procedure 
i can't even remember if we do random sampling anymore . 
i know we did in the military , 
but i guess you're always on call for it . 
i not very long ago worked for walmart 
 and about a year and a half ago they instituted uh , well drug and alcohol testing program . 
it's not a random 
through the s , 
as each employee comes in 
 and then they have thousands and thousands of samples that , uh , going through it in a day and bottles get mixed up , things like that . 
so your big beef with it is the , uh , 
it's   .
it's a good idea , 
but like you said the drug testing procedures need to be defined a little better . 
make sure it's a lot safer because a couple of people are going to be discriminated against unfairly or whatever . 
my uh , brother used to work for walmart 
and then , i don't know if he still does or what because i don't know if sam's is actually part of it , 
 but he , you know 
then he's been working for the company for a while , too . 
he , uh , 
good company , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
you all , uh , have some , 
company's , that was a great place to work . 
it's good news .
they got to had two or three years in with them you can start buying stock 
and you each payday to 
but , uh , you can build a pretty fair amount of stock after a while . 
that's what my brother was telling me . 
that's good deal . 
uh , think what else i can say about that . uh , 
uh , do you have any idea , uh , 
let's see , 
as you got into t i ? 
uh , now , uh , were you asked to wait before starting to work until the drug test came through 
uh , no , 
well , let me think about that . 
it was after , i had already been hired . uh , 
you get hired , then you come in the first , 
seems to me i remember that , uh , i was hired , came in and went through some orientation 
and i thought i , 
boy , i can't remember . 
that would seem strange to already be working here in the first week of the drug test . 
maybe it was during the interview . 
i came up a couple times for an interview , 
so it's hard for me to remember where i was when all that happened . 
but , uh , i guess , just like other companies , other friends i've been hearing about that have been moving around , 
it's before . 
they have to wait for the drug test to come in before you actually get employment , 
so i'm 
what about , oh , 
they just instituted it there at walmart 
they , it was after i was already working there 
and they weren't testing any of those who were already working . 
now then you heard the question , 
well , i'll tell you , i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on , than i do now . 
uh , i do the easy stuff now . 
i change oil , 
uh , and then what some people would consider a little more difficult , i'll change spark plugs 
but , uh , i can't do as much as i used to , 
um , i used to do a whole lot more , but not any more , 
they're just too weird to work on now . 
is that the reason you're not doing it , 
or are you so busy you don't have time to do it ? 
well , that's part of it 
part of it is , like you said , i don't have time . 
well being a female and being alone , i don't do anything but put gasoline ,
but , uh , have you had any major repairs recently ? 
but i had a van before , 
and it was only two years old , 
and it had transmission go out on it . 
but fortunately that was covered under the warranty . 
well , you should feel very fortunate . 
i had to have a transmission replaced in an eightysix automobile 
 and i'll declare , that's an expensive . 
oh , yeah . 
maybe i should have just traded the car in . 
sometimes it makes you wonder . 
oh , it just , 
well , i have a very comfortable car 
so , um , anyway , i have a new transmission , 
and i'm sure that any of them would have or charged me almost the same amount . 
it hurts , 
did you take it to a dealership ? 
oh , i see . 
i had , um , 
these people were recommended by a neighbor 
 and , you know , that's the only thing , 
i am not a native of dallas . 
oh , i see . 
so that means i have to depend on trustworthy friends 
 and that's . 
anyway , it's fixed , 
it's running , 
and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it . 
oh , gosh . 
it's going to run for a while yet . 
oh , i know it . 
it certainly is frightening . 
what work are you in ? 
uh , i work for t i . 
i work in the networking area . 
do you work for t i ? 
no , 
yeah , where there are a lot of people down there that could help me with my car , 
but they're all too busy . 
i have to do it the other way , 
and that's find someone and pay them to do it . 
i'm planning on it . 
oh , it can't be any worse than last year , 
that's for sure . 
oh , it could be , 
but i don't much think so .
that's true , 
well , we're starting out a new one , 
so let's make it a good one . 
i'm going to try and plan on it . 
all right , well , i enjoyed the conversation . 
thank you . 
all right , thank you . 
what , um , 
do you watch much t v 
or , you know . 
um , no , 
um , usually the reason i will turn it on is to hear the news . 
the news , 
but i don't think of that every day , even . 
um , i think i get most of my current events , 
well , i get them from everywhere . 
i sometimes watch t v if i , 
i guess i watch t v if i haven't read the paper that day . 
we don't get a paper 
but i work , um , at a , 
i teach a college class 
and , uh 
oh , uhhuh . 
there's a , 
the library has a paper . 
and so i often drop in on a break and 
and i keep the radio on quite a bit when i'm home . 
and then big news , i'll hear it from my husband when he gets home or ,
now i also , 
i get it from all over . 
i watch the news every day , 
and we have a news , 
you know , we get the newspaper , and , uh 
you know , i'm , 
i read a lot , 
so i get , 
um , you know , i'm really up on , uh , current affairs . 
i get , you know 
what's your favorite news , 
do you get a news magazine 
 but , um , you know , as i said , i do , 
uh , it's easy to keep up on current event , you know 
we've got . 
and , uh . 
are you satisfied with the quality of coverage ? 
uh , i don't know .
is there anything missing ? 
i , you know , .
it's kind of hard to know . 
and i don't know , you know , i mean , what are we supposed to , uh , compare it to 
whatever they tell you , 
you know , you know , i'm satisfied . 
i mean , i , 
uh , you know , they're supposedly covering everything that happens , 
 you know . 
well , i do feel a little bit like , 
being from california and wanting to hear like 
i've heard through the grapevine sometimes that there's been an earthquake or sliding or something , 
oh , really ? 
i don't ever hear it in the news here . 
well , uh , sometimes it's such a , 
you know , you know like 
but most of you know , they do have like tremors out there , you know , there'll be a small article in the paper about it . 
but , uh . 
i sometimes feel like , um , the dallas paper and the dallas news , um , the top headlines are always a murder , you know . 
oh , well . 
 the first newspaper , you know .
i'm sure . 
you know , but , um , i don't know . 
i guess i'm satisfied , 
i don't , uh . 
i mean , what basis , you know , of comparison do we have really ? 
we don't get a , you know . 
that's true . 
we certainly get enough coverage . 
i mean , we can get news , 
you know , i mean , there's even the c n n channel 
oh , yeah , 
i was going to . 
sometimes you don't even want to be bothered with the news because it's all so bad .
it's all so negative , you know . 
often times . 
so . yeah . 
well , no , 
oh , is it really ? 
well , yeah , 
i don't , uh , .
i don't know , 
becau , i , 
you know , like one , uh , well , 
oh , really . 
and it was really . 
we were laughing , 
i mean . but , you know , we don't really do any gardening , 
you know , i mean , some topics , 
really you know , now , this topic , this is , i mean , 
so , um . 
well , i guess i can just say um , you know , on the news that , 
well , it seems like , i don't know , some things are sensationalized or some things are , um , 
you know , you'll hear one report 
and then you'll hear that you know , they didn't , um . 
so , what are your favorite shows ? 
um , i like watching colombo and , um , matlock and 
oh , really ? 
quantum leap ? 
did you see it the other night ? 
um , uhhuh . 
that was pretty good . 
that one was . 
what about , 
what do you , 
with the psychic and everything ? 
uh , i like northern exposure and , uh , home improvement . 
oh , well i haven't seen either of those .
you've never seen northern exposure ? 
 oh , it's a great show . 
um , i also like to watch star trek , 
but it's on so late here , that i don't always get to see it .
we like it , too . 
have you seen the movie ? 
and they're , you know , already out with number six by now , 
so i haven't seen any of the movies , yet , 
but i . 
oh , you haven't seen any of them . 
oh , well , they're good , 
they're real good . 
uh , they're getting rid of the old cast for the movies , though . 
which ones are you watching , the new ones ? 
i haven't seen really the new generation that much . 
oh , okay . 
well , they're a lot different . 
but , i like the older ones because at that time , you know , they were really futuristic , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
and i guess the newer ones are real futuristic , too , 
but i like both of them . 
i do too . 
i have a brotherinlaw who really likes the old ones a lot , 
i mean , he almost hates the new ones .
not really . 
it's not really like 
 oh , i think , 
 but it's , 
but that's true , 
i mean , you learn more about the characters and stuff , 
but that's the way all shows are now . 
well , let's see . 
um , i like to watch colombo because it's like a mystery thing . 
that's sort of how matlock is , 
but colombo is way tricky 
 i mean he doesn't even try to let the person know he's getting onto them . 
 well , it seems like they always 
 well , did you see the one . 
or is there a series on . 
um , yeah , 
well we see it thursdays at seven , 
this last time it was about this , um , movie director , 
did you hap , 
 did you see that ? 
see , that was a rerun . 
 oh , i guess i nev , 
i wondered if that's 
 see i don't know if that's or what , 
but it seems like there's only about four or five different ones , 
and then they keep showing them over and over . 
oh , i guess i haven't seen it before . 
he was a movie director , 
and he had that gal killed . 
on the set or something . 
that was pretty good though .
it was . 
but , yeah , 
i like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things . 
but , um , there's never anything good on saturdays , though .
no kidding . 
i don't think so . 
well , star trek's on at five , 
but i'm never home 
what is it that , 
there's something i watch on saturdays , 
and i can't remember what it is . 
now i used to watch twin peaks . 
you never saw that ? 
i've heard of , 
a lot of people somehow or something .
they'll say , so and so from twin peaks , or something , you know . 
that was a different soap opera . 
but , it was a different type of show . 
i didn't like the way it ended , though . 
oh , did they end the whole series ? 
they only did it for , i think , two years . 
but it's all over now . 
oh , another show i like to watch is mash . 
so . how's your products been ? 
um , i really haven't had , uh , too many problems . 
uh , seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out . 
 i hear that one . 
have you had any lately go out ? 
and they , 
unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time , when i bought my new house , 
and , uh , i really don't have any recourse , 
so i had to call and have them all repaired and that . 
oh , wow . 
it was a hassle . 
so you didn't get anything , 
even , all the warranties were out ? 
the i , 
the refrigerator warranty's still good , 
but the ice maker itself , passed its three years , 
and it was three years and two months . 
you're kidding . 
we just moved into a new house , too , 
so we had to buy all those , too . 
uh , watch out . 
the only thing i've had problems with is , um , 
i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail 
 and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such , 
and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings . 
i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than , 
i just ended up using it . 
but , that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong . 
i usually have pretty good luck with appliances , 
but i just , uh , 
it was within two days that all three of these stopped working , 
that's incredible . 
and the , uh , microwave had to have , uh , some kind of something i can't even pronounce , 
and they , uh , 
the dryer had to have a new heating element , 
so it was almost three hundred dollars for all three of them . 
and they all went out at the same time ? 
 or two days . 
i was , 
it wasn't a good week . 
i was pretty mad . 
plus the place that i'd bought them all had gone out of business , 
so that manufactured , 
but still they were through that retailer , 
so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not . 
it's frustrating . 
but i didn't have to worry about all that , because they weren't under warranty . 
so . it was a call to the local appliance dealer 
but , i , 
the only other things that i've ever had trouble with , uh , 
i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers , blow dryers . 
they go out a lot ? 
one was under warranty , 
and the other two weren't , 
but , i just , 
other than that , you know , t v s and things like that , i haven't ever had any trouble with . 
i don't think products are getting much better though . 
see i'm in the manufacturing   
home from work 
and make , um , automotive air bags , the safety air bags . 
oh , really ? 
that's interesting . 
at morton international , 
and , i thin , 
well , it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment . 
we test everything after each assembly process , 
and so our testing is pretty thorough , 
do you test each individual one 
 or do you just test , 
like if you've got ten , you test one , 
and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay ? 
um , the tests that , 
we don't , 
i think they test four or five a day , actually exploding the air bags 
 product , um , after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag , we check to make sure it's there after we install it , 
so , each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done , 
and then we do electrical tests on them during the process , 
well , that's something i've never had to use , 
i've never been involved in an automobile accident , 
so , luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test . 
but i think it's a great idea . 
seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about 
but that . 
well , they do all the testing that we have to do through the government , 
it's incredible how much testing they have to do . 
oh , i'm sure they want to be thorough before they . 
but , uh , even , 
you know , i don't mind spending the extra money on the car 
i'm not a real big seat belt , 
my , uh , 
well jackie , uh , on taxes , that my opinion is that i do think americans are paying too much in taxes . 
uh , what's your feeling about that ? 
i agree . 
i think taxes are high . 
uh , where you live do you have a state income tax and a sales tax both ? 
oh , yes . 
uh , uhhuh . 
in new hampshire we have , uh , uh , no , what we call broad base taxes . 
no income tax and no sales tax . 
uh , we tax business , uh , eight percent , 
businesses are taxed eight percent 
and we have what we call the five b s . uh , for our taxes . booze , uh , butts , cigarettes , beds , uh , hotel room tax 
so , uh , we do have a very low tax rate , 
but you know , combined with the federal income tax . i think that americans generally do pay too much in taxes 
and   .
i agree 
and i ,   think it's about the time of the year when you just start getting , 
well if you do get money back from like jobs , 
i'm still a student 
so i get a check back 
 well that's nice . 
from taxes 
 nice to get a refund . 
it is , 
do you think that , uh , for whatever taxes we do pay that , uh , we are getting value for it ? 
uh , my opinion of taxes is that we just send money to washington or to the state 
and they say they are going to send some back , 
it's like one arm giving the other a transfusion . 
you know what i mean ? 
uh , it really , uh , 
i should say one arm giving another arm a transfusion through a leaky tube because , 
there you go .
and that is that money tends to stick where it lands first 
and when you send it to washington or send it to your state capitol , uh , a lot of it stays there and not that much comes back to you . 
i don't know . 
don't seem like they are doing much with it , 
  i mean there's plans there 
and now that they are voting and people , you know , getting into   drug and that stuff . 
they have nice plans 
 uh , but , they don't always work 
and then you know they try to raise taxes more 
and i don't what happens with all the money because if their plans don't work , 
you know , but taxes get raise 
so . i don't know . 
i'm not really into politics , uh 
that it , 
i don't really understand it 
 but it's just you know  , 
well , it does seem that the more taxes that are raised the more the politicians spend . 
uh , it's almost like they will spend as much as they're allowed to collect . you know . 
uh , there is an interesting proposal that's been going around now for a few years of having a flat tax . uh , ten percent or thirteen percent . 
there would be no figuring . 
i mean you would take your income tax , 
you would have a certain amount , 
i mean you would take you total salary 
those who made under a certain amount wouldn't owe any taxes , 
and then there would be a set amount for however many you know , dependent you have , 
and you would just pay a flat tax . no exemptions , no deductions or anything else you know , after you figure up who's in your family . 
and that would eliminate a lot of the bureaucracy in the i r s 
and it would eliminate all these loop holes that the fat cats get away with . 
the could be nice .
i'd like to see something like that . 
i think it would be fairer 
and it would put you know , a lot of the tax attorneys our of business 
and i am sure they will fight it tooth and nail , 
but i really think a flat tax would be a lot fairer for all americans . 
i mean it doesn't seem right that somebody that makes twentyfive or thirty thousand dollars pays four or five thousand dollars in taxes while somebody that makes two hundred and fifty thousand dollars might pay nothing in taxes . 
it doesn't seem fair to me . 
it isn't , 
there is not much out there that is fair , 
that's for sure . 
i will agree to that . 
do you know what your state income tax rate is ? 
um , no 
twenty percent ? 
i have no idea , 
i just . 
my dad does it all for me .
you just pay it , huh .
 i use , 
you're like my daughter who is in college down in massachusetts 
and , uh , she works as a waitress 
and she is attending college full time also 
 and she sends her taxes to me 
and i figure them up . 
she really has no idea . 
she gets a refund check 
how do you keep up with current events ? 
um , well actually , usually , uh , in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work , uh , 
usually catch the news in the morning . 
what what channel do you watch or what station ? 
uh , n b c . 
that's the one i watch . 
i usually keep up with t v . 
i don't , 
i am a student 
so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff 
 so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which really isn't 
i usually tend to just , you know , rely on , you know , t v , uh , again , you know , just through the grapevine just to know like , you know like what today's stories are 
and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one . 
the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes . 
the stations i listen to are just mainly music . 
i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all . 
do you think that t v is , uh , pretty accurate . 
i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized 
well , what i really don't like about t v , especially local news as compared to like national news is just , uh , it seems like everything is very spoon feed 
and you know is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom 
they mainly go with like popular topics 
any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press , you know , which only happened like ten times in my life 
it's something wrong . 
looks like they're going more for ratings than for 
i think , you know probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers 
they typically have a better . 
i am from a small town too here in texas 
the farm report . 
farm report and oil reports . 
that's pretty sad 
or who killed who . 
also i have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television   .
read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down 
well , uh , in dallas , i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's 
and the story was , uh , 
was that like he started shooting people in this cafeteria or something ? 
and the news covered it 
and they were taping people who were crying who 
and then like three days later this , uh , local news station was using as as their promo 
i just thought that's kind of cold , 
 oh yeah , 
i have seen that happen lots of times . 
and it was just , 
they were showing like these dead people 
 and they were showing people crying 
 i mean just taking advantage of you know . 
they are trying to get the , you know , most emotional response for , 
it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story , 
but just the play on people's emotions .
it's just gotten so , 
i mean , somewhere it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite that if you know 
 and everything . 
you know , i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know 
 uh , you know even the national news i just find it to be you know 
what did you think of the coverage of the war ? 
uh , i found it very one sided . 
did you ? 
uh , you know , it just seemed to lack any sort of debate . 
uh , you know , not saying that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there , 
but it just seemed like , you know . 
they kept just showing , you know , how great we were doing 
and it never really showed what actually 
a lot of times like the news coverage showed all you know , the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties 
 and they kind of you know , 
if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who 
and i really think that you know in the involvement that the press states , you know the military basically sets the press , 
think about , uh , taxes . 
well , i think they're a necessary evil . 
uh , i wish the government would operate on the same premise that , uh , businesses operate on 
and that is , uh 
you spend what you have 
i think that , the general idea is to you know , for the deficit spending to help pick up the economy , 
but they're running under the assump , 
you know , the way they're running it now , they're you know , running  it under  a deficit spending , you know , while we're not under a recession , 
so there's never any surplus coming in to counter the deficit that we're running , 
so that's kind of a basic thing of economics , i guess , keep spending , keep going into debt , 
you're not going to payoff what you owe , 
well , i , 
it just depends . 
uh , uh , roads are very expensive , uh , commodity and so is , uh , utilities they supply and police and fire department , uh , 
you know , they need to make a living . 
so  , i think for many years , uh , we've paid teachers and police officers and firemen who are , uh , to a great extent , public servants 
i agree with that . 
but , uh , then again , uh , it's of , uh , government , including municipalities as well as state and federal governments . 
i guess , 
i'm a student right now 
and i don't make a whole lot of money 
and , so , my education is state sponsored . 
i go to a state sponsored school 
and , uh , my education all up through high school and stuff , 
so i guess i'm kind of in debt , all that long . 
my parents , i guess , however , have contributed to that , you know , for the education side of it and everything , 
but , uh , i usually end up getting money back . 
i will this year anyway from a , 
uh , you're very fortunate . 
i am .
i need it , too , 
we just try not to pay any more in than we have to , 
uh , we pay in a substantial amount . uh , 
we don't regret paying taxes . 
we do think that , uh , sometimes , uh , we have a reverse of a regressive tax , a progressive tax . 
and progressive tax , i think , uh , does not give people incentive to make more money , 
and what i mean by that , the more income you make , the more tax you pay . 
more taxes you pay . 
it should be , i think , a flat percentage 
and , uh , that percentage ought to be an equitable amount . 
uh , last year when they passed the tax laws for the , uh , nineteen ninety , ninetyone , whatever , nineteen ninetyone 
and i totaled them all up 
and basically , uh , we were going to be paying seventy or eighty percent tax . 
now , that was the assumption that you spent that same dollar for every item on there 
well isn't , 
but , you know , there's a lot of taxes you pay that you're not even aware of that you're paying , uh , 
like when you buy a tire , you pay a federal excise tax . 
there's a yeah , lot of hidden taxes . 
you pay gasoline taxes every time you pump something into your 
the taxes that people don't think about that , 
the income tax is a lot more visible portion of the taxes you pay , i guess . 
but you probably pay more percentage wise in other taxes . 
there was that , 
which can , 
was it jerry brown , 
one of the democratic candidates had a proposal for doing away with all i think a flat percentage , something like that . 
yeah  , 
if you implemented a flat percentage , it would encourage people , uh , to make more money 
and what people need to understand in my opinion , now this is just my opinion , okay , uh , is that businesses create jobs and jobs create income and income pays taxes . 
that's , because 
and so , 
based on that , who do you think you're talking to , 
you're talking to an employer . 
up until , like , eightyfive or something was the , 
in texas 
i don't think i agree with , 
 oh really . 
you don't believe in it ? 
uh , i wouldn't say that . 
i think i would have said that a few years ago . 
when i was younger i thought it was , uh , a sign of a civilized society if you didn't have , uh , capital punishment 
but , um , uh , maybe slowly changing my opinion . 
i'm not thoroughly opposed to it . 
i still think it's sort of true that a more civilized society wouldn't have to use capital punishment 
but i'm beginning to believe this is less civilized society than i thought .
you sound a lot like a friend of mine . a 
she has very black and white opinions , you know . 
there's no gray in her opinions , you know . 
she probably would agree more with you 
 but i don't know . 
i think i would rather a person go ahead and be put down than give them the opportunity to get out and do it again . 
i've never had a crime like a murder touch my immediate family 
 but i still feel very strongly that capital punishment is a good way to punish , especially criminals who seem to have absolutely no remorse for what they've done . 
and we see that more and more . 
like in our state right now , there's a fourteen year old boy who raped and then killed a seven year old girl 
 you know , that's fourteen years old . 
what's he going to be doing when he turns into an adult . 
i certainly don't , uh , advocate turning people like that loose . 
i'm not sure executing them , uh , does anymore than keeping them in jail , 
but , uh , 
it doesn't 
that's a factor . 
 and , yeah , 
to me it is . 
i mean , i work and i pay my taxes 
and i lived out in texas for a little while 
and they're 
and that's a pretty heavy state compared to georgia .
i mean you guys are a lot more , uh , for to each his own even than we are in georgia . 
but even in georgia that's the attitude for the most part . 
if i work and pay my dues 
but when i've got to work to pay my dues and your dues 
well , i , 
the cost is something 
but but i think it's relatively unimportant compared to what's the most effective way of ,
and i guess i would like , 
i don't know , 
the european countries certainly , uh , none of them have capital punishment 
 oh , really . 
you can't , 
they don't execute anybody in britain or france 
and i don't believe they do in germany or italy either 
and they don't have the crime problems we do . 
i don't really think that there is too much of a relationship between the two . 
i guess what worries me about capital punishment is , uh , when i see people enthusiastic about it and , uh , uh , sort of bloodthirsty . i think it brings out the worst in the people who do the punishing 
and that bothers me . 
you might be right . 
but it , 
but , uh , 
i mean i'd hate to be the person to pull the switch , you know , 
i would never in a million years want that job 
 but i do believe it's necessary 
and i , 
on the one hand i guess i admire the person who has the guts to do it because i couldn't 
and i couldn't pull the switch 
but , uh , 
 well actually i , wha , 
the other thing that bothers me is when it becomes a political issue because uh , i don't really think it's a very important aspect of fighting crime or law and order or anything else . 
i think it just becomes a , uh , symbolic i'm tougher than you are type of emotional issue for politicians 
i would like for it to be settled once for all and , uh , get in the background while the more important issues get discussed , uh , uh , 
 like i said ,  some years ago , i think i would have said there's no place for capital punishment in the ,
now i'm not so sure of that . 
i wouldn't vote against somebody just because it was for capital punishment and 
 uh , i guess i'm , 
my view of  , uh , 
i'm beginning to believe that some people are simply not rehabilitatable and , uh , that , uh , uh , 
maybe it's more a symbolic gesture uh , uh , than anything else 
and , uh , i've also never been a victim although i have two friends whose wives were murdered 
 and , uh 
 oh , gosh .
 oh yes , 
if it ever touched my fam , 
i don't know what you drive now . 
i mean , what do you drive now ? 
uh , i have a ford pickup 
and , uh , the family car is uh , a dodge caravan .
oh , okay . 
so , uh 
throw them in the back . 
they sort of fit our requirement . 
i have one of those , uh , pickups with the , uh , seat 
oh , yeah ? 
and so they just fit in there . 
when they get to be teenagers with long legs , it may not work . 
right now , i can throw them all in the back when we have room 
there you go . 
and i kind of like having a pickup truck . 
 actually , i think of it .
i know . 
i like the way trucks are built 
and i don't care about comfort . 
so , i'm pretty happy . 
you're looking at , 
i got a toyota four runner . 
i wanted a truck that i wanted something that i could throw people in the back too , 
so i got a four runner . 
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another one . 
i never buy new 
so i wouldn't hesitate to get another used truck . 
you're just like me . 
i've never bought a new vehicle in my life . 
 and , uh , yeah , 
i don't need to pay for the glitz . 
  and i'll pay for the rest of it . 
 let somebody else break it in , 
and , uh , the van we're sor , 
we might go again on a van . 
something just a little bit larger than a compact in a sedan next time . 
i'm not sure . 
we'll have to face it in a couple of years 
but , uh , 
 and we were real happy with that because , uh , my second requirement after price is , uh , low maintenance . 
and , uh , it certainly had that . 
we didn't do much to it at all . 
pretty much the same . 
 say  i got one of those toyota four runners 
 and , uh , it pretty much does everything i need it to . 
i mean , it'll tow three thousand pounds 
so i can tow everything 
and it , 
i can throw , 
i've had eleven people in it before .
and , uh , it's real reliable , 
i mean i've had it for almost four years now 
and up until , oh , say two weeks ago , it had never had anything wrong with it . 
and then , of course , two weeks ago ,
i don't know , 
it's the strangest , weirdest thing in the world , 
but it blew a head gasket . 
didn't do any damage to it . 
 uh , i caught 
at how 
uh , oh ninetyseven 
so it's not real early .
you didn't overheat it ? 
uh , i smelled the coolant .
went out and looked . 
saw where it was coming from . 
drove it right to the shop and left it off . 
 well that was ,    , 
 and that was it 
because i have that 
and then i have a kawasaki motorcycle .
 i mean that's sort of my ,
it's a  , 
i don't know , 
people who buy motorcycles for transportation i think are kidding themselves .
i have one colleague that , uh , commutes to work on one when it's not raining 
and , uh , uh , he's a , 
he's pretty conservative guy . 
i don't think it's much of a sport for him . i guess , uh , 
i know 
but i bet you he really enjoys riding it . 
i'm sure he does , 
so , you know , yo , 
when was the last time you just to go driving ? 
and i go out twice a week on the bike , so . 
  uh  .
but , yeah , 
another car , 
uh , i would consider going just an open bed to throw stuff in . 
i'm sure that that's very , 
i mean you got one . 
that's really convenient to be able to throw that sort of stuff in the back 
if i only had some place that i could store the , uh , camper top , i would have it off most of the time . 
i really leave it on there just just to have it out of the way because you put it on the ground it gets dirty . 
to have it out of the way . 
but , uh , they're solid . 
uh , trucks are built , uh , i mean , 
i think they last a lot longer than anything else . 
 they're the only things americans still know how to build 
and , uh .
the trucks do . 
uh , even though , you know , are good there too . 
but so are the , 
though i think the chevies , 
i don't think the che , 
i don't like the chevies as much as i like the fords . 
i think the fords tend to last a little longer .
so , mine's a ford .
a friend of mine just it's a really nice truck . 
i mean , i don't like dodges at all 
but one of the dodges they have out now has uh , the cummins turbo diesel on it . 
oh , i heard about that , 
 oh , it's beautiful . 
that thing will last forever  i mean   , 
 that's a serious truck . 
oh , yeah , 
that thing's , uh , 
it's got a boat engine in it .
this , uh , 
i know a contractor who just got one of those . 
he's pleased with it . 
 well i haven't had an awful lot of , uh , incidents regarding child care . 
when my two year old was in new orleans , she got bit on the cheek 
uh , the extent of it . 
but when , 
i really for , uh , you know , child molestation . 
your little turnip off to , uh , you know , this child care place 
and they don't pay very much 
and in your little turnip unless , you know , one of the motivations in the hidden agenda is well that's somebody to molest , you know . 
and , uh , that's a terrible kind of thing 
and i don't think my children have ever been subject to that 
but my wife didn't work 
and so we really didn't have that much exposure to it . 
well i am a working mother .
i have three children 
and my children , uh , since they were very young , 
i've had various , um , different alternatives , child care arrangements 
and like most working mothers i'm really not defensive about it . 
i personally feel , uh , in our particular situation , i'm a much better mother when i work out of the home 
and my kids , i think , are very secure , well raised children . 
my comment on this is that we paid an absolute fortune 
so i , e , 
you know , it is a problem . 
i think the real problem is the low pay child facilities 
and that is sometimes what some women who have to work , that is all they can afford . 
when our children were very young , we had a live in paid babysitter that 
and then as they got older , they went to , uh , i preferred to call them schools 
and they were really all day preschools 
and they were wonderful . 
and i think they got exposed to a lot of neat things . 
oh , well that's interesting . 
but we really truly did pay a fortune . 
i mean we were paying at one point , well close , about five hundred dollars a week for two children . 
oh , my god . 
 well you must have just one hero ace professional job to support something like that . 
 well , i mus , 
i'm a physician . uh 
 oh , well , yeah .
 and i felt , uh , very good about working . 
i'm a pediatrician actually . 
uh , but i think there are some wonderful child care opportunities out there for children 
and we all know the kind of things that you're supposed to look for . i think , 
 well , not all of us . 
you know what the kind of things you're supposed to look for . 
i'm an engineer . 
oh . well 
i think it's real important that you have a place that , first of all parents have a lot of input into and that they're always welcome and that they have a lot of activities where parents come in during the day and that at any time you can drop in . 
and we had a really wonderful arrangement , uh , 
i'm with the university actually 
 and they had a wonderful , uh , program that started at age three 
and it was about a block away from the hospital where i work . 
and so , many times , at lunchtime , i would go over and visit the children and eat with them and see what they were doing . 
and they had wonderful , 
they had things like gardens and lots of pets 
and they had a four to one 
so that sort of an , 
most of the teachers had degrees . uh , 
five hundred dollars a week .
that's incredible . 
it was incredible actually .
 oh , oh . 
but it was good . 
i mean it , 
at that time there were two children 
and they were in special programs 
and each one was a little over two hundred a week 
and then , in addition , i paid a little bit extra . 
i mean they really had some great opportunities . 
but , tha , 
what you were alluding to earlier is , you know , women who work for minimal wage 
sometimes they do put them in , uh , fairly low 
 you know , 
 they could , 
somebody will have a job at three hundred a week to get off welfare 
even that really , i think , i don't , 
it's been awhile since i've looked at , 
my youngest child is eight . 
so it's been a little while since i've looked into , actually daycare centers . 
but they are 
 you know , the good ones do cost maybe sixty dollars a week since   .
 i mean we used to pay fifty cents an hour to babysit . 
but mine are twentytwo , twentythree and twentyseven 
i guess babysitters now are up at , what , five dollars an hour ? 
oh my . 
well , you know , but you made the comment earlier , why would someone be interested in children . 
i mean it has been a real , uh , 
there have been some good entrepreneurial type experiences . 
and i think they have captured a certain market . 
again the , 
but then there are babysitting groups . 
as a pediatrician , one of the things we've been real concerned about is the infections . 
as you start putting lots of little kids together , the infection rates that go around .
oh , yeah . 
hi , cynthia . 
what did you wear to work today ? 
um , let's see . 
what did i wear to work today ? 
um , actually i wore corduroy shorts with a white blouse , um , and flat shoes . 
so , can you dress pretty casually ? 
um , i do vary . 
um , you know , i wear suits , 
i wear skirts and sweaters . 
on occasion i can wear jeans . 
um , how about you ? 
well , i , um , run a business out of my home . 
so i tend to get up in the morning , put on ,
um , you know , there's no real dress code where i work . 
um , you see people wearing , you know , all different attire . 
i , um , don't like to wear heels , that really tires me out . 
i work in a big building . 
so , i predominantly wear flat shoes . 
um , you know , in the winter i wear sweaters , 
in summer you know , i like one piece dresses , short sleeves , things like that . 
i've recently , um , tried to update my wardrobe , trying to put suits together that i can interchange , the ,
that's helped me a lot with having , 
i can only have a limited wardrobe , since i'm only ,
um , but still , it gives it some variety .
what about your casual wear ? 
do you like to wear jeans most of the time ? 
um , yeah 
i mean , at home i predominantly wear sweatpants and things like that ,
it's nice you can wear shorts , especially on a day like today when it's so hot . 
well , um , you know , they're like ber , 
dress shorts . 
they're like black corduroy bermuda shorts . 
and sometimes i wear a blazer with them , 
and i get really a lot of compliments on them . 
um , where i work is predominantly male . 
so , you know , they , 
their attire is always the same , you know . suits or slacks ,
but   , 
 um , but i'm really the only woman , i guess , at work that does that , 
but seems to work for me .
but  .
in fact , i just got a new outfit as a gift that , um , 
it's one of those skorts , 
you know , th , 
it's shorts but it looks like a skirt . 
so , i think that'll be good for work , too . 
oh , yeah . 
it'll be comfortable . 
i guess down here , uh , 
we just recently moved to texas , 
so my wardrobe has changed quite a bit . 
um , we moved from colorado where , 
and i have a closet full of sweaters . 
well , see , i live in virginia . 
you live in virginia , now ? 
oh , that's interesting . 
so , i'm , 
you know , like right now , today was in about , you know , the fifties . 
but , um , you know , i do wear a lot of sweaters and things like sweater dresses . 
i'd like to be able to wear those here . 
today it's eightyeight degrees . 
oh , my .
so  , 
needless to say , my sweaters have been hung in the closet for quite a while now .
today was , uh , definitely a shorts day around here . 
we're still pretty much , you know , in winter , as far as that goes here . 
this is pretty unseasonal , 
but , uh , at least , we , 
you know , it feels good , 
it gets , uh , 
everybody doesn't have cabin fever today . 
it's nice to get ,
sounds good . 
it was nice talking to you . 
it was nice talking to you , also . 
um , okay 
particularly what kind of music do you like ? 
well , i mostly listen to popular music . 
i , uh , listen to it all the time in my car , 
so , i tend to be one of those people who switches stations a lot because i don't like commercials . 
and , uh , quite honestly , i , i have some little children 
and i , unfortunately , found myself listening to a lot of nursery rhyme music here lately , 
but that's not by my choice . 
oh , really . 
how about you ? 
well , um , .
lucky you . 
i do listen to a lot of , 
you know , i switch the stations a lot because i don't have a cassette player in my car . 
um , um . uhhuh . 
uh , uh , however , i do like a lot of different forms of music 
so i switch quite often . 
um , i think i like , 
i'm really particular about the type of music that i listen to . 
but , the , uh , 
there's such a wide selection , 
i like a little bit of a lot of different types of music . 
you know , that i feel 
if it is performed correctly or if it's done right , or if the version is done right , i like it  , 
but , if it's not , then i won't . 
i really don't , 
how do you feel about rap music ? 
rap . 
it seems to be so popular these days . 
well , i don't really have anything against rap music . 
the one thing i do object to about rap music is when it becomes militant ,
i have strong objections to that . 
um , actually i listen to , 
one time i remember , this was back when , even , uh , 
i would say about ten or fifteen years ago i , 
when it was really just starting . 
and , uh , it was about , 
i think about forty or fifty years old . 
and , it was incredible , i mean , the parallel , you know , between it and rap . 
and , um , you listen a lot , 
if you hear a lot of old gospel , uh , uh , especially well , the black gospel . 
you know , you know , you can really pick it up . i mean , 
you really . 
it seemed to be influenced by a lot of different music . 
a lot of times you'll hear songs that you know , they're not original ,
and , uh , it sounds so much different 
and yet , i have a much younger sister who listens to a lot of rap music 
and , uh , she thinks its pretty funny how often i know all of the words to songs that she's listening to , 
and yet ,
of , you know , like standards , i guess you could call it . 
that's right . 
i think it's kind of absurd , you know , the fact that , you know , they don't really give , you know , the original artist , or the original composer ,
i guess there was even a bit of ruckus caused by the m c hammer , who's really , you know , 
seems to be the hot one of today . 
he used , um , wild thing . 
do you remember that song . 
he used , um , 
i can't remember who the artist was on that . 
jimi hendrix was the original . 
he wrote  , 
was it , 
well , maybe it wasn't that one . 
and , uh , i guess that they hadn't originally gotten , um , permission ,
and , the song goes on 
i don't know 
i think that even jimi hendrix did it , 
i think that was a cov , 
you know , come to think of it , i think that was a cover version of , like a john lee hooker song , or something , 
maybe so . 
i mean it was just like , 
it was really old . 
i mean i , 
there are so many different songs , 
i mean like the whole thing about cover versions a lot of times . i mean i've heard some songs that i just thought were horrendous cover versions of , 
you know , oh , that was really great . 
that was you know , a really good piece of work , 
they destroyed it . 
i think a good one was , um , 
there was a peter frampton song , 
oh , yeah! 
and , then the cover version , it was pitiful . 
i remember seeing the video of it on m t v , 
and i thought it was hideous . 
i did too . 
it was , 
ugh , i didn't like that either . 
but you know , whatever became of peter frampton . 
i mean , there was nothing , 
he was a phenomenon , 
i me , there was no reason for him to really come into , you know , great stardom or anything . 
i remember , i saw him in a concert , when i was , 
i think it , 
i think it was in high school . 
i think that probably what did it for him was the fact that he was a good stage performer . 
he was very good . 
i remember i saw him in a huge stadium in , uh , philadelphia . 
it was in j f k stadium , if i can remember . 
oh man . 
hundreds of thousands of people is what it seemed like . 
i graduated back in seventynine , 
um , um . uhhuh . 
but i've really , 
i loved , 
i mean , i was really into the album oriented music , even then , 
so i was really familiar of the a o r type music . 
um , the album oriented like uh , james taylor ,
oh , yeah . 
i mean , the comparison made between new kids on the block with the beatles . t was just , 
you can only laugh .
you just sort of , 
you know , well i guess i can just humor them , you know . t this point . 
 well , they , 
i guess our age is showing when , we think that . 
but well , you know , i've liked a lot of the new music . 
i think , um , 
i saw some promise , you know , when it came out , uh , 
and then , um , i don't know 
music it's in a very weird position right now . 
i think that , 
i mean , i like , you know , like to hear , you know , what they call world music . which is , you know , using all these natural forms of music 
like paul simon . 
well , you know , really that's not world music . 
but , using , i guess what they call it is eclectic , you know . 
what do you mean by world music ? 
well , world music is , um , 
to another type of listener . 
uh , for example , let's say you're taking like an original brazilian form of music with a certain style , 
and then you try to make it a little bit more listenable for , let's say another audience , let's say a north american . 
and , then when they hear it , it's another form of music , and ,
the best of every type of music . 
because , i mean , there are some , i mean , 
i li , 
there are some , you know , types of heavy metal that i really like , 
i completely like heavy metal . 
i think , 
you know , and it's the same way with , 
you know , world music takes the forms that have really been , um , 
i guess , i 
you know , or , you know , the cream of the crop , i guess you could say , 
um , that are extremely enjoyable , and then taking , 
so then it becomes a kind of music of its own , so to speak , 
or , uh , 
i mean , when you listen to it , it's um , uh , 
i think that they don't use , elec , 
some of it , 
they use electronic and acoustic interchangeably , 
so , you know , well a lot of the stuff you hear coming from south africa now , and from west africa , that's considered world music , because it's not particularly using certain types of folk styles . 
but , they're trying to make it somewhat more modern . 
another good example was i heard miles davis , 
and miles davis worked with robbie shoncar ,
 you know , he's a jazz performer , 
and then he's playing with robbie shoncar , 
he's a very good arranger . 
uh , arrangement to , uh , 
are they trying to    , 
i don't know . 
but , uh , 
but , i mean , when i heard his album , i heard it and it was just incredible . 
i've been listening to that a lot lately . 
i listened 
and , i heard , 
you know , you hear this guitar , 
and then you hear the muted trumpet . 
and you never would think that they can actually play together 
oh yeah . 
i don't know , 
which end do we push 
but okay , 
well , um , let's see , 
their , uh , opinion is going to be heard 
and , you know , there's such a small voice and such a huge number of people in the united states 
and that , you know , 
their , vote's not going to make that much difference 
and whether you vote for one person or the other person , the issues is you know , what you believe in , 
and that person is going to have a lot of , uh , 
since there's so many issues , this one person can believe a lot of different ways on ,
so , it would be really difficult to have that one perfect person that believed exactly what you believed . 
that's true , 
you know , a lot of people , uh , uh , 
i think uh , the party type followers , the guys that , uh , you know , follow the party lines , you know , 
and if they're republican they vote republican every year , you know , 
and , uh , the people that are independent , you know , are the ones that to decide which are the good aspects and which are the bad aspects of a candidate . 
that's good . 
i always thought 
back when anderson was running , i was hoping that things would change and he'd actually get elected and party politics would start going down the tubes , 
but , um  ,
there's , uh , a lot of extremes on the parties , too , with you know , the real , uh , far side of the democrats 
they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago , um , the democrat party being liberal like they are now , you know , would never be thought of , 
it would be the other way that the republicans were real liberal minded as far as like , uh , moral standings and those kinds of things . 
that's , uh , 
the politicians are the ones that are usually pushing for more people to vote , 
i'm always amazed that each candidate thinks it's going to be the people that come out that will vote for him , you know . 
that's true . 
i think in , uh , the texas governor elections , i think more people turned out to vote against somebody than for somebody , this time . 
well , that , uh , 
  i know that there's certain issues that can really motivate people because we live in a predominately catholic type area , 
oh , really ? 
and when things start , uh , 
inspired , you know , 
and , uh , still on the other hand we're also , uh , 
this particular community is a catholic community 
but , uh , uh , down in d c and that sort of movement , 
and so it's , uh , quite the opposite , 
so elections start getting very , uh , 
the elections where they have that topic seem to be a little bit better attended than some of the other ones . 
that's true . 
but , uh , 
that's true that the different places in america that , uh , you know , different issues would be a lot more important than  say in  another place . 
i can understand the midwest , 
and , uh , it doesn't matter who they put in office , they're going to fall subject to , uh , the pressure that the lobbyists can put , 
and it's , uh , real true that , uh , you know , they'll say one thing ,
and then once they do get elected , they don't have the power or the authority or the willingness to do those things that they promised , you know , beforehand . 
you know , maybe it just wasn't possible at all in the first place , you know , like the no new taxes thing . 
you know , that's , uh , 
with the economy going the way it is and everything , that was nearly ridiculous 
well , i don't think he's going to have to worry about that next year . 
i think he can probably raise taxes and still get elected . 
after the war . 
that really , uh , 
unfortunately that will probably even drop lower , the voters turndown ,   even more because more democrats will think that they don't have a shot 
so they won't even bother turning out . 
uh , that's true , 
we'll see you in four years . 
  hope some of the local , 
well that's what at the booths , 
the country 
so they don't come out , turn out to vote 
and they're the ones that , uh , you know , really know what's going on , have the experience and seen , you know , how politicians can , you know , screwup or what ever . 
but , i know , my grandmother hasn't voted in years . 
you know , neither has mine as a matter of fact . 
and , uh ,  , that's true , 
i think they look at it as , well everybody , the majority of the people think this way , when that's not necessarily true ,
well , the majority believes this way 
so , uh , they don't even bother turning out to vote to express their , uh , opinions . 
so that's true . 
do you hear the dogs in the background here ? 
the children next door just opened the fence 
and they went off . 
oh , yeah ? 
but anyway , that's , 
and , uh , 
what part of the country are you from ? 
uh , washington , d c , 
are you really ? 
this is , 
i'm from , 
this is dallas where i'm at . 
oh , okay . 
the outskirts of dallas . 
do you work for t i in any way ? 
how did they get you ? 
um ,    , they went through engineering companies , 
and , uh , we're communications . 
i work in a communications company . 
oh , okay , 
i work for t i 
so , we saw it on the , uh , t news one day 
and i thought , wow , that might be interesting . 
  sort of different . 
that was very strange . 
i was like , 
but , anyway , it was nice to talk to you and , uh , sort of meet you , 
well , if your ever in , uh , d c , come look up wayne  sherman   , you'll say oh , yeah , talked to that guy . 
i'm kyle hunt ,
we live right by the airport . 
so do we . 
oh , okay . 
right next to dulles . 
all right , i'll talk to you later .
the , uh , uh , 
you know there are so many ramifications to this entire thing of woman , 
uh , look at them , 
in england ,
so many , uh , women are heads of state 
and we keep saying oh yes , we feel some day a woman will be president . 
but , uh , i have some question , whether or not they will ever really get around to that . 
i think we'll have a black president before we have a women president . 
and , uh , i don't know whether that's bad or good , 
it's just a point that i have observed that we , 
racial issues in the united states ,
um , because you know , it's , 
uh , oh . 
uh , oh , i think , we're supposed to hang up . 
well it wasn't the matter of wealth , 
it was the matter that they were not wealthy ,
well , i'll talk to you later , 
all right . 
thank you . 
bye , bye . 
uh , what do you think about , uh , the idea of having volunteer service for everyone ? 
 uh , i think that , uh , really it wouldn't hurt most of the young people of the country to have to go and do voluntary service . 
uh , and , you know , i mean , 
and i've talked with several 
and i think they've gotten a lot out of it . 
well , are you doing any kind of volunteer work now ? 
but i have done , uh , red cross work 
and , uh , i've taught c p r training 
what about , when would people do it , when they finished high school ? 
i think probably as soon as they finished high school it would be ideal , because a lot of times , if they go straight into college i think they're going in too quick 
i think particular boys that the maturity , 
in fact i wasn't very mature when i left high school 
and i think there's a real challenge there . 
there's also of , uh , you know , whether you're really ready , 
and i think it gives a different perspective . 
uh , y , 
year and a half , before you start to college , you appreciate college more ,
the only complication is how do you fund something like this ? 
 well , a lot of parents fund their children . 
there are , uh , some groups that have their children , you know , go away for a year . 
even the religious organizations . 
i think the mormon church sends out missionaries that , 
and the parents fund them for the whole year and a half that they're gone . 
uh , it's interesting . 
it gets them away from home and gets them to do something useful , 
although the kids today , though , almost that their concern for money , 
be curious 
as to if , 
if there was mandatory , you could choose the option of either a mandatory military service or voluntary , 
do you think that would be reasonable ? 
to be in the military for a certain period of time . 
uh , i was in the military , 
and i personally feel the draft , that they should draft women as quickly as they do the men . 
well , but , of , which , 
what would you have them do ? 
you know there are a lot of people around with , 
there's a lot of unemployment right now . 
what would you have these people do if they were brought in ? 
what , into the service ? 
well , yeah . 
or say the volunteer , 
say that , 
well i , 
i don't know if you remember about the w p a , 
my father was in the c c c   .
he was in that ? 
i mean , you know , uh , it's not the best thing in the world , 
but , uh , it gave them something to do . 
well , it seems that there's some things like and pick up trash and even aluminum cans and some of these kinds of things . 
or go into the more depressed areas and help repair the houses . 
in fact , we helped with , uh , oh , help to help humanities , 
and that was a good experience , 
but you take the kids out 
that either need demolishing , or need fixing up , 
it would be a good idea . 
i think that , uh , 
do you have any other further comments ? 
well , it was good talking to you , betty . 
i'll talk to you later . 
have a good night . 
mainly i read the bible these days . 
that's very good . 
i do , too . 
good , that's great to hear . 
uh , and christian literature . 
uh , i've kind of , 
i used to read a lot of , uh , novels , 
but it seems as though if you really want to set side time to read the bible and you work and 
it does . 
and i been praying that god would put a desire to read the bible in my heart 
and he really has . 
it's getting ,
that's good . 
that's good . 
uh , it's hard for me to find time , also , to read . 
uh , a lot of times i do just read magazines and stuff like that you know , because i don't have a lot of time , 
but when i do get to sit down and read , i like to read the bible 
and i like to read , 
i read to my daughter a lot , too . 
do you ? 
and , uh , i like to read , you know , bi , 
i have bible storybooks 
 so i like reading those to her 
and she really enjoys those . 
so that's good . 
don't have a lot of time ,
so , it's real enjoyable .
have you ever read any of frank e peretti's ? 
frank e 
 , no 
uh , this present darkness and , uh , uh , i forget the the other , 
well uh , he's also written a lot of children , 
how old is your daughter . 
five , 
he's written some children's books as well 
and they're all spiritually ,
oh , really ? 
what's his name again ? 
peretti  , 
frank e peretti , 
frank e peretti .
p e r e t t i . 
because , uh , i love to read his , uh , children's books just  , 
just to read them . 
well , that's good . 
oh , they're good , 
they're great . 
that's good . 
and it's like , uh , uh , usually about a family of , uh , archaeologists 
oh , that sounds pretty neat . 
it is . 
it's real exciting . 
and it also teaches them spiritual warfare 
well , that's neat . 
well ,  , i have a , 
my daughter has precious moments collection 
 and i like that because it's real easy to , uh , follow for her , 
you know , uh , gosh , if i read straight out of the bible to her she'd never understand any of it . 
well , it's hard for me . 
that's right .
to follow and understand , 
and , uh , i've got a bible that , uh , has a little bit of uh , a glossary in the back 
and it helps explain who people are . 
that's about the hardest thing is , who's related to who .
i know it , 
and especially it's hard to keep your interest 
it sure is , 
 but it is good reading 
and it's good for us ,
that's right . 
i really do enjoy it . 
but , uh , i also , 
but then on the other extreme i like to read , uh , uh , i don't know , horror , steven king type books . 
i've read a lot of his , too . 
and i like that , 
that's good fun reading . 
can't put them down . 
you can't , 
you really can't . 
they are good 
and ooh they're just so suspenseful . 
i really do enjoy his . 
uh , there's another guy . 
oh , what can , 
what is his name .
you would , well 
you know when you're recording you can't remem , 
i know .
uh , oh , dean , uh , kratz , or kranz 
judith krantz ? 
judith krantz . 
i know her . 
uh , no , 
oh , okay . 
and he writes the same thing , though . 
it's that real ,
that's good . 
uh , his last name ends in a z , i know that . 
oh , i think i know who you're talking about . 
uh , i've seen , 
i don't think i can pronounce it either , 
yeah , uh , 
i'm in a book club 
and i think i've seen his books 
i've never read any of his . 
but they're real , 
i kind of got burnt out on steven king , though . 
it seems like it's all the  , 
did you ever read the , uh , uh , oh , 
it's one of his first books , the stand . 
i know it . 
and that seems like all of his books have kind of come from that , i mean . 
they do kind of follow or ,
you know , that , 
i love that book , though . 
i thought it was great . 
it really was , 
and i loved the shining . 
ooh , yes .
that was my favorite . 
oh , those hedges when they started moving . 
whenever  , they made that into a movie , i was thinking oh , my gosh if they show that ,
for some reason that scared me more than anything . 
that is , 
he just brings stuff alive , you know . 
you could just visualize everything . 
and that was a pretty scary movie , too . 
i think they did a pretty good job , 
but  ,
but they did you know , do it justice . 
that's right . 
but , uh , most of the time they don't follow books very well .
that's true . 
i liked it as well . 
yeah , uh , 
i did , too . 
that was good . 
uh , i also liked , uh , cujo . 
did you read that one ? 
except it broke my heart . 
i'm a dog lover . 
me , too .
and then , uh , night stand , 
is that night , 
dead zone . 
that's one i liked . 
oh , yeah . 
that was a , 
i've read that one , too . 
that was a real good one . 
he's written a lot of books . 
boy , he just sits down eight hours a day .
i know it . 
and then he has some under , uh , another name .
that's right . 
that one about the gypsies , or that ,
or , s , uh , 
uh , i think his name was bachman . 
he wrote under the name of bachman . 
richard bachman . 
he is really interesting . 
he's so prolific . 
ooh , i wish i could do that .
oh , i know it . 
and i have gone back 
and , after i graduated , i read some of the old classics that i just bluffed my way through 
i do , too . 
i love good old , 
once you can get into the language , 
you know , the l , 
like , it's english , 
but it's not the same english they speak today . 
so it's kind of hard to keep , you know , at it , 
that's true , 
but i , 
that was one of my favorite subjects in school was , uh 
me , too . 
i used to love those good old books . 
nathaniel hawthorne is pretty scary himself . 
i liked , uh , oh , 
gosh why can't i think of their names , 
uh ,  , shoot , 
the one that wrote , uh , wuthering heights . 
uh , well , you know who i'm talking about .
those are good old 
that's right . 
sure is neat .
that's why i like to watch that masterpiece theatre on channel thirteen ,
a lot of people just don't have time to read nowadays . 
i know it's really hard for me . 
i work two jobs and 
do you ? 
so it's hard for me to 
well , i can imagine . 
but when i do i just love it . 
me , too . 
thank you very much . 
it's good talking to you . 
you , too . 
well , what is your view , do you consider the soviet union a threat ? 
 , well , you know , of a threat it is , i guess , 
to get used to something , 
you know , if they have completely chain , 
you know , not what they used to be , 
much in the past that whatever the top said the rest fell , you know , rank and file in behind it . 
and now that with gorbachev is introducing more , i guess , or expressions of freedom , it doesn't look as though , you know , everybody's following the same pattern . 
and , those , 
the people who are , you know , the staunch military conservative people , 
you never know , well , gorbachev's future is like whereas , 
i thi , 
the thing that keeps happening is happening so fast and so , uh , dramatic that you almost think , now wait a minute , you know , we're getting stuck into something here , you know , 
and , uh ,  , um , you know , i'd like to think that that isn't true 
but i , 
you know , the evidence is that , uh , you know , some stuff go , you know , the east german situation . 
it's just the whole thing is so incomprehensible , 
you know , if i'd have been asleep for five years ,
well , it's amazing just because of the drain that's been on , you know , both economies that our economy of course , been able to , uh , withstand that a little better , 
but , uh , the russian economy 
you know , they , 
i don't know what the percentages are , 
but i heard it one time , 
it's just some ungodly number just to support the military machine . 
and finally , you know , who knows 
uh , the u s isn't the threat that we've always made them out to be ,
but it's hard to thing that just one person can bring that much of a radical change in that short of period . 
even if it is , you know , the best thing in the long run , it just steps on too many people's toes ,
i think , you know , what i'd have to , 
a little bit , you know , leery of the whole thing . 
what i haven't seen is uh , you know , a great stepping back in the military ,
you know , it's one thing , you know , to let us go ahead and sort of disarm 
and , you know , i even had a thought once that the whole iraqi thing might have been just a deal to go ahead and let us , uh , you know , 
of course , it didn't turn out that way . 
and , uh , uh , a kind of far out way of thinking about it i don't know . 
well , it's interesting , anymore the world's getting so small that it doesn't seem to tolerate anymore any kind of the expansionism ,
uh , but , of course , the people who have challenged that or tried to do , have not been world powers . 
so , it's easier for us to say , you know , to an iraq , you know , 
 or we can do something about it . 
whereas , you know , if the soviet union would have , who knows what taking over mongolia will we have been more just rhetoric ,
well , was turning around 
and all of a sudden it was like somebody in the red square or wherever said , okay , 
and that's enough . 
and the tanks came in and ,
uh , that , 
  personally i don't see as gorbachev as being maybe a threat , 
and i think he's actually , honestly trying to do some change . 
but i don't believe that he , in this first pass around , you know , being the first one to really turn things around or attempt to is going to be allowed to get away with it either . 
well , this would be like if somebody was elected president of the united states and suddenly took off toward , you know , just some pretty hard by the socialism , 
and , uh , you know , the reaction , uh , 
you know , the economic , 
well , it's coming apart at the seams . 
well , no , 
it's not the same sort of a thing at all because that , the whole soviet system was put together under total force , 
you know , there was no , 
as we are seeing now with a lot of those ,
you know , they , uh , nobody vo , 
you know , a lot 
 man   , those people didn't vote to become part of the soviet union , 
they had no choice . 
that was always kind of interesting , 
you know , a lot of my friends have taken us down , the stance of , you know , these people are just trying to be free and trying to get away 
and i'm thinking more of it from a nationalistic , 
you know , if i'm a soviet and if part of , you know , south , let's say south dakota wanted to you know , succeed , am i going to stand for that . 
now i realize that the origins are different and that we all joined under a common direction and a common bond to begin with ,
but you know , i , 
it's easy to believe that they were probably more forced into a pact than , uh , a volunteer or willingness to join . 
there was the whole thing was put together , you know , by force . 
no real question about that . 
and some of the countries that were forced in at in the forties , 
and , uh , well , it's not that they came in , it's they were conquered by the germans , 
and then , 
and then the russians even ,
so . that's a ,
well , that whole a , 
the whole idea if you look at the russian history and i guess all countries the way it used to be is , the only way to truly protect your borders was to have a buffer . 
and that was the whole idea why they had so many buffers 
and maybe , you know , more and more people are seeing , oh , countries hopefully are seeing that that buffer isn't going to help you , 
you can , 
well , i guess like , 
the reason they have the  angolan heights  and and lebanon was just as a buffer 
but , you know , as you can see with the scuds go right over there . 
they don't really pay a whole lot of attention to buffers . 
that binds you anymore in today's technology . 
i knew a lot of guys in the service when they were sent to germany they said that's the safest place in the world because if a war starts , all the bombs are going to go right over germany 
and they're going to land in other places , 
you know , that's going to be the safest place to be . 
that's probably very true . 
that's very interesting , never thought of that . 
well , uh , i guess , what they'd have to do to , 
i really don't know , 
you know , you know , i hope that what's happening is exactly the way it appears . 
nobody knows what to do . 
you know . uh , 
is it real ? 
but you wonder how , well , this thing , 
evidently was elected president of the soviet ,
i get confused between the russian provinces ,
well , in the center 
but you got was traditionally known as russia 
and then all these little nationality groups ,
you know , and these were all the soviet economists ,   you know , they had some real fancy names for them . 
matter of fact when the , 
uh , yeah , 
what i read when the , uh , uh , of these , you know , republics ,
oh , as a , 
you know , 
as a vote . 
and , uh , that sort of , 
you know , they backed down on that . 
died down on that . 
i thought it was interesting that recently here the warsaw pact no longer exists as a military force , 
but it's merely an economic now . 
well , wonder if that  , 
 well , i mean at   , 
wh , uh , w ,
you know , it's all , 
you can change the name of something 
but i wonder if it's still , exists . 
although , i've seen some evidence that , you know , the , uh , the russian soldiers are , 
well , you , 
the funny thing there is they're not particularly welcome back home because they're having housing shortages now . 
what do you do with all these troops that have been taken care of by , uh , bulgaria and , 
 and all the , 
and now all of a sudden they're going home 
and somebody's got to pay for their , 
well , that's what they're saying the whole problem , you know , with , if we were to demilitarize europe , 
 , what are we going to do with all the soldiers over there ? 
well , that's not , 
what's going to happen to the economies that are no longer have you know , 
well , since you live close , i don't know if you know , um , about what louisville is doing with recycling , 
or are you familiar with any of that ? 
well , i know that we have some relatives that live around , like the   area in there , 
i know they're doing some curbside recycling as a kind of a test there . 
you know , i read , you know , 
when they first started doing that in the paper , i read about that , 
i was just praying that , that would be in our area , because we've been recycling for quite some time . 
and , you know , we separate everything out , and then have to haul it up to a  metco   ,
so if they would come up ,
they'll help you ,
well , now have they moved them behind walmart ? 
oh , god . 
because i finally asked because , you know , we had all of those milk cartons 
and there was nowhere else to take them 
and they had it in front of walmart 
and i ask in walmart 
and they said they moved it just behind . 
that's really nice to know , because we were doing the same thing . 
because to take it to a  metco   , you have to take it when they're open , you know , 
and so when that thing came up in walmart parking lot , we thought , oh , this is great . 
and we started taking them up there . 
and then , all the sudden , it disappeared , you know .
i didn't know . 
and we're going , oh , no , there goes our recycling place . 
that's really nice to find out that it's behind there .
well , we pretty much do , um , plastic milk cartons and , um , um , um , newspapers . 
i couldn't even think of what you call them . 
plastic milk cartons , newspapers and cans , and glass , i guess , is really the four things that we do . 
like aluminum cans ? 
that's about what we do too . 
and really , that's really about it . 
is there any place else that really takes anything other than that , that you know of ? 
oh , really . 
uh , we just don't have the room to store all that much , you know , 
i know . 
i don't want to be running down there every week ,
i know . 
we're kind of the same way . 
you know , at first , you know , you , 
at first it was a real hassle , 
and i'm wondering are we really going to do this , 
but you kind of get , i guess , into a little routine , you know , where it is automatic , now , to throw ,
you know . so i just go , you know , 
we have a pretty good size pantry in our kitchen 
and i've just got three trash cans sitting in there , 
you know , we just kind of dump things in each one , you know , 
those milk cartons take up so much room . 
oh , they do , too . 
and they're impossible to crush . 
i mean , you can't get the down to any size , you know . 
if you get four milk cartons and that fills up trash bag , you know pretty easily , 
so . you know , 
i guess we kind of started recycling after i moved here about a year and a half ago . 
oh , really . 
we were using baby food 
and there was so many baby food jars ,
some of our neighbors were doing it 
and so , you know , when i found out some places to take it , 
and , um , like , um , they also take some things at the flower mound dump behind the fire station there , 
and i know that they're going to use , you know , the money for that to build some kind of multipurpose field and that type of thing .
oh , that will be good . 
so , you know , if i'm not going to get the money for aluminum , i would just assume give it to the city of flower mound .
let somebody get something out of it . 
that's true . 
and they won't raise our taxes . 
 yeah  .
well , i was kind of hoping with , 
you know , do you work for t i ? 
i have a friend ,
no . 
there was a , 
t i has got this organization called t a d which is t i'ers against drugs . 
and , you know , we're recycling aluminum cans up here uh , just what you would buy out of the machines and drink here 
and there was crushers out in all of the hallways you know , 
and that's , 
they use the money from that to fund this t i'ers against drugs program . 
you know , t i doesn't give them any money , everything is made from that . 
and they had talked about having a thing like , one saturday a month , you could come and drop your aluminum cans off from home , you know , 
i shall , 
they would do that because at least somebody was getting the money out of it , you know . that was going to use it for good , 
sounds like you have a little one just like i do .
she'll be two in july . 
mine was two in december .
well , it was good to talk to you . 
well , it was nice to talk to you . 
i know they've started over in richardson where my dad lives . 
they pick up newspapers , i think . 
oh , do they really . 
curbside pick up ? 
i really hope they do that in louisville . 
it would make it a lot easier on all of us . 
talk to you later . 
so what do you think about it ? 
how are we doing in recycling ? 
are we , 
well , i think we need to do more . 
i mean , i know i need to do more . 
they have programs around where you can reach the , uh , 
they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up . 
but i have a hard time separating my trash , 
and get all the 
and , you know , i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet .
i do a lot of work with the boy scouts , 
and we try to do a lot 
 but there's still a lot more we can do . 
you know , i don't recycle my newspapers myself , 
but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a clothes hamper kind of thing that , you know , you lay your string in , then you put your papers in there 
so i figured i might get me one of those 
sometimes it just sits around for a while , 
and then we just chuck it . 
well , i don't get the paper every day , 
but , you know , i get it on , 
i try to buy , you know , the early edition for the coupons , you know , the sunday edition . 
but , then i just , you know , bundle it up and put it on you know , the front walk ev , 
but that's the extent of what i've done . 
i'd like to be able to do more . 
the problem is , with a lot of it is , you know , it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it , you know 
see , and , 
it's not always convenient to do it . 
see , and here in lubbock everything's so close . 
i can imagine what it's like up there . 
i'm not exactly sure where you know , the can thing is , 
but , you know , sometimes it's just so , 
seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash , and have 
see , i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago , as a matter of fact , and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall 
 and then i put me a little five gallon bucket , 
and it's just outside the garage door 
 so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket . 
do those can crushers work good ? 
and it's actually metal 
it's not plastic . 
i didn't want to buy a plastic one . 
because those things i think would just snap 
but payless cashways has them 
and they're metal , 
and i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there , 
but it was only like seven dollars , not too bad . 
i'd have to check into something like that , because , i mean , we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here , you know , 
but , um 
i don't , 
it's pretty tough . 
so . i don't know , 
i don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that , 
you could probably just , you know , 
you know , you know , it , 
sometimes , even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper , you know , 
they won't take 
 yeah , they won't take any lint free paper 
or , see , i work at t i . 
so does my husband , 
we do a lot of recycling out there . 
now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard , 
but that's just now come on board . 
you know , we've been throwing paper out there away for years , 
and we're just now getting on board to recycling 
i don't know what , 
you know , i haven't , 
i'm sure they're probably doing that here some . 
i'm sure they are . 
t i is doing it pretty well nationwide , i'm sure . 
i think it's necessary , 
i like it , 
you know , it makes , 
i think it's good that you see these , you know , like boxes , cereal , 
they're now starting to make you know , the packages out of recycled paper , 
oh , yeah . 
and i think they're just fine . 
i bought a , 
i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work , 
it's his birthday , 
we're pretty good friends , 
and what it is is a recycled paper bag 
 and it's just got happy birthday printing on it , and a cute little phrase inside , 
and it's just a paper bag 
 you know , and it's really cute . 
but , i think we're doing better and better all the time , 
  still don't , 
i think we're becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more . 
there's not going to be any room , shortly . 
the office , 
i don't know what new york does about theirs . 
i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere . 
it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere .
 but i think we're getting better at it 
i think there's quite a bit more we could do . 
 girls , put that away . 
but , you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth . 
i just wish it was a little more convenient 
you know , seems like you're so busy anyway , 
and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about . 
it sure is . 
i think if , you know , the cities , locally , you know , they'd get more programs going so that you could do that , it'd make it a lot easier . 
well , they'll get at it sooner . 
i guess the schools will get into it , too , sooner or later . 
get the kids 
you know they have , 
we tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have , 
and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans . 
you know , if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people , sure they'll save them for us , there's no problem there . 
but what do you do with them in the meantime ? 
that's right . 
now i don't want a garage full of cans .
that's right , 
who does . 
you know 
you know . 
they're not prepared for it . 
and in texas , they're just get , things like that , 
they just get bugs in them . 
they do . 
so , you don't , 
you know , the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get , 
that's for sure . 
that's right , 
i'm pretty lazy about it right now . 
everything goes into one thing and goes out to the .
you know , pick it up . 
about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans . 
well , i need to get better at it . 
well , if we all try a little bit , a little bit goes a long way . 
that's right , 
if everybody tries to do just a little bit , and a little bit more then 
that's true . 
that's right . 
well , thank you for calling . 
no problem , 
take care . 
all right , 
i , assume you have kids .
she's only nine months old . 
oh , well she doesn't have to worry about public schools yet . 
well , my degree is in teaching , 
i was a substitute teacher for about a year . 
oh , really . 
i , uh , thought i wanted to be a teacher 
but before i went through all of that i wanted to see how i was going to like it . 
and they , uh , 
in alabama , where i came from they allow you to substitute if you got a four year degree . 
so i went out and played substitute for a while and decided , nope , not for me . 
did you teach in all subjects or in all grade levels 
it was , 
i just took grades one through six . 
i thought i was going to be smart and get the good kids , wrong . 
 well , my degree was in fourth through seventh grade 
but i taught junior high . 
and i expected it to be a lot of trouble 
but it wasn't that bad , 
i taught remedial reading kids . 
and , well , they don't call it remedial reading these days ,
but , anyway , at the time that's what i taught . 
and , um , you kind of group your behavioral problems together that way ,
but it wasn't too bad . 
we got long real well . 
well , i sometimes wonder if i didn't mess up . 
i maybe should have taken the higher grades because at least you can , if you have to you can get mean with them . 
those little kids don't understand it . 
especially with the real young ones . 
i started out wanting to teach lower , like primary and then top primary and thought , well , no , i don't like this as much and ended up moving up and got up until about the sixth 
and so that's what i got my certification in . 
but i had decided long before i was even married that i wanted to , if possible , teach my kids at home and not put them in the public schools . 
um , and my reason for that was i don't like uh , what's the right word . the varied inappropriate influences that you find so much in the public schools . 
well , that's a nice way of putting it . 
you can find a lot of good public schools if you look real hard 
but i don't think they could cover everything that you could teach ,
and too , most people don't have that option . 
you know . and plus it also depends on the district your in as , i mean , on the , 
i've seen some districts where all the schools are lousy it doesn't matter what you do .
i don't know .
back when i was going to school uh , you just didn't get away with the things these kids get away with now . 
i mean you pulled stunts like that and you were down at the principal's office and , uh , usually bending over to get five of the best , 
um , but they can barely scold the children for something , you know , without getting sued . 
and um , the crime is just escalated and the drugs and ,
oh , yeah . 
well , the thing that really did it for me , i was subbing in a fifth grade class 
and , uh , this kid comes to school with his lunch box 
and inside this lunch box i'd say two hundred to two hundred and fifty dollars in one dollar bills . 
and i didn't believe it for a minute . 
um , uh , but , uh , you know , the , 
not a lot i could do about it . 
can't stop the kid from bringing money to school if he wants . 
crazy for him to 
well , i have , 
i've full , 
i think i understood what the kid was doing he was a , uh , 
well let's just say he was one of those types that you wouldn't doubt that he was selling something . 
but not a lot i could do about it . 
well , we had the problem when i was in , 
with teaching , um , 
i was eighth and ninth graders that i worked with 
and if we did have a student come in and they were drunk or they were on something you had the option of calling the police and have them taken out of the schools or trying to teach them something while they were there . 
and you don't know if you were reaching them or not 
but we felt like , you know , maybe just going ahead and trying to teach them was better than have them taken out . 
because , uh , uh , that just , 
that doesn't do a lot for them . 
i mean it ,
but it doesn't do anything for them . 
uh , most the time if they were , 
some of them were even better behaved . 
i've only had two instances where it was really noticeable 
but they were better behaved when they were , um , 
i don't know if was alcohol or something else that they were on 
but it ended up better 
uh , i don't know , 
guns and , 
i don't know 
it's something . 
i think there's a problem too with teachers trying um , to be so versatile that they do loose sight of the basics , you know , 
they've been a big drive especially in the seventies to return back to the basics . 
you know , just teach the basics in schools 
but i think there does need to be a reemphasis of those because ,
oh , yeah . 
oh , sure . 
i mean , we've done something wrong . 
and when you see , uh , koreans and chinese and japanese who are taking all the , uh , science jobs , all the engineering jobs , all the mathematical jobs 
and , you know , here we are 
we can't balance a checkbook without a calculator . 
um , i don't know . 
well , i spent a year and a half in japan also 
and i've seen how their school system works 
and i , 
they go by a complete rote system , 
you just memorize everything . 
and then at the end of a certain time period you spitted everything back out 
and the better the memorizer you are the better your grades are going to be . 
so i don't completely agree with that either . 
but there , 
that's a great deal what law school's like .
oh , is it ? 
is that what you ended up going into ? 
and , uh , i did the same sort of thing , 
they just , 
you sit there and read hundreds and hundreds of cases 
and then you get one examine for the whole semester 
 and it's how well you can remember it all . 
how much can you stuff in your brain . 
and i found that a particularly useless way of studying . 
i never did . 
i always tried to understand things , not tried to memorize . 
and consequently some of the very best students had excellent memories 
but they couldn't put two and two together as far as the law was concerned . 
it didn't show me anything . 
a year and a half , i gave it up . 
i wasn't really wa , 
i didn't want to be a lawyer anyway ,
i don't know . 
what can we do about it ? 
good question .
there's plenty of money in the system , 
it's just , 
i mean , they're throwing more money at it now than ever before 
and things are getting worse . 
i think it's like a lot of things in the united states . 
we've got so much built up in the , uh , bureaucracy and in the politics of it , 
and in the power plays that it needs to be pulled down and started over again 
and there's no way that , that can be done . 
not without wiping out a whole generation of kids in the school system , 
maybe on smaller scales . 
well , i don't know 
i , uh , 
as much as i didn't like school when i was going through it ,
and i think part of it is that they've got to give authority back to the local school . 
you know , i mean , that these people are handcuffed when it comes to discipline . 
right into the classroom it needs to be 
i mean teachers are so afraid now of even saying something ,
it's like doctors in lawsuits , 
oh yeah . 
 you know , they're kind of fearful  of ,
well , lawyers help create that .
well , at least i've heard that 
i haven't fortunately been in a situation where it's ,
well , i mean what we've turned the school schools into now are just daycare centers 
 you know , somebody , 
we're going to send our kid here for seven or eight hours a day 
and he's out of our hair . 
and the other part of it is parents have quit becoming parents . 
you know , they're just , 
oh , yeah 
it has to be reinforced in the home . 
oh , sure . 
so , i don't know , 
i don't know what the answer is . 
it's an interesting thing you want to do . 
how is texas about keeping your children out of public schools , 
do they allow it ? 
you have to prove that you're teaching them something . 
you have to follow ,
um , they try to encourage you to follow a specific curriculum , although you don't have to . 
and then if you have particular religious beliefs they're kind of monitored . 
you know , they will allow you to , 
i can't think of any examples 
but certain religious groups don't want their children in public schools because the influence . 
and maybe they were a group of mennonites or something like that . 
i don't think they're were in this area 
but , um , um , by the state school board . 
that's interesting . 
i remembering reading a few cases about when some people first tried that and they got sued .
i'm glad the parents won . 
i mean , it seems silly that , um , we started 
that's the way you got your education in this country . 
and then , um , 
i grew up , uh , in the sixties , 
and at that time , uh , it was a changing time for the whole music scene , i guess 
and i grew up with the beatles and the rolling stones and the whole pot culture during that time and went through that phase and kind of stayed with it i guess for several years after i graduated from college and thereafter 
but have since , uh , 
i grew up in a small town in southern oklahoma 
i have kind of gone back to , uh , more of a county , uh , flavor in music . 
um , i'm not quite sure why that is 
and it seems like almost a opposite , 
but i guess i got away from what i consider to be the pot , uh , sounding music . 
it didn't have a story . 
it kind of reminds me of my roots of growing up 
and i've become i guess more of a country fan over the years . 
when you say that you grew up , uh , in the sixties i take it that was the , uh , teenage type years 
or , uh , 
i was born in fifty 
 and , uh , 
we're very similarly aged , 
so we probably have an interesting perspective on the music on the times , 
so i'm just a couple years older than you , 
um , essentially i was one of the nerdy types in high school really which meant that for one reason or another i didn't pay much attention to music , 
but as i look back now i realize it was very formative for me , 
uh , my early popular music interests were in simon and garfunkel , whom i saw perform when i was in college 
and i became attached to that style of , uh , urban country if there is such a thing , 
i think in a way one could talk about simon and garfunkel that way because they do tend , uh , to have a dramatic or story approach to their music , uh , usually tend to have some good or bad moral to it . 
uh , over time i became very interested in baroque classical 
and i think that was just through experiencing contacting college and the fact that i found it very relaxing for me . 
my tastes now run i guess to a upbeat , uh , simon , 
it's something that interests me , uh , combined with the classical tastes i had mentioned . 
and my classical music tends to be confined to the seventeen hundreds , early eighteen hundred music . 
i'm not a music , um , 
   , i'm not particularly schooled in it . 
i know what i like to listen to as far as classical music . 
and i , 
that's kind of the way i am . 
i listen to some country and western 
but i'm not schooled in it 
and i've enjoyed the times when i have listened to it . 
i played a little bit of piano . 
i continue to do that . 
i want to do it 
and i never have the discipline to stay with it , 
but when i do play , uh , and begin to reacquire skills i inevitably fall in love with country western music which tends to be in some ways easy to play for a new piano player . 
and tone . 
and uh , uh , something to fall into . 
i'm kind of the say way , 
i've gone through different periods of life , uh , in music from pop to classical . 
i guess one of the things i've worked in radio stations as a d j for all my college years trying to support my way through there , 
and suppor , 
was support , 
i was influenced by all different kinds of music 
but basically because that's where i worked . 
and i've developed a real love for , uh , classical music in , probably junior high and high school because my band instructor was , uh , heavy into classical type music . 
he said he used to sit on saturday mornings and watch cartoons just to hear the music , uh , that they were using behind them because they used , especially disney used a lot of classical music , uh , behind the cartoons 
and so consequently we wound up playing a lot of classical music there 
and i think that , uh , got deep seated into me . 
one of things i especially like now in music regardless of what kind it is , uh , are those that call on those classical , uh , roots , i guess , uh , barry manilow comes to mind for some reason there's not a whole lot of his stuff that i'm real crazy about , 
but he does have some things . 
chicago had some things , 
uh , and i think even electric light orchestra had some real , um , influences by classical music 
and i'm still , 
my favorite , 
in fact most of my c d s are classical music . 
i find it very interesting that some television shows that i enjoy i particularly like the music . 
i don't know which is chicken and egg in that situation . 
uh , a good example would be , uh , 
i have connections but not particularly deep ones to the vietnamese war type situations , 
uh , and i found that i really like china beach 
and i particularly like tour of duty 
and both of them , i had as much fascination of the background music , i think going on as i did to the theme of the shows , 
uh , and i , i've , uh , thirty something i'm particularly interested , 
but it's the music ,
i'm kind of thinking that's maybe , 
our generation was , uh , so in tuned to music of that time that we identify goodness or badness with , uh , things now with the music that's behinds them . 
that could well be . 
in college when i , 
a song by the , uh , uh , 
i think the title of it was just downtown , 
uh , and if you recall how it goes downtown ,
uh , all i have to do is hear that song and i get strongly evoked memories of difficult times in school being behind on work , 
uh , and my family now knows if they come into my study and , uh , i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done , uh , at school , uh , and i'm humming or whistling in a sort of mad crazy way the tune to downtown they know to just stay away , 
that's their signal . 
they can hear the unconscious music signal behind it , 
that's right . 
when did you first take your , uh , first piano lesson ? 
uh , probably about first grade , 
and i have , uh , returned about every four or five years to thinking that i would like to do something about it . 
i usually get to the point where i can play some of my favorite themes 
and then inevitably i am swept away by the pressure of other types of things , 
it is a time consumer . 
it is . 
in order to continue to grow and 
i always think that i'll be able to do it 
and then i inevitably discover that i have no innate music talent relative to composition and that i struggle and really can't quite understand what is that other people take for granted ,
and i , 
keys and things are something to me that remain a mystery no matter how many times i bang on them . 
i have a pretty good mathematical concept for what's involved , 
uh , but in a innate music sense there just seems to be something missing there which is always frustrating for me since i have pretty high math aptitude 
 and i keep thinking , gee , i thought that all the math and music people are supposed to go hand in hand 
it's making that connection especially with the mechanical parts of it . 
i was never able to master all that . 
in fact my brother and sister both , they were , oh , thirteen , sixteen years older than i , they went through the , uh , parent thing where you've got to practice or you're not going out to play thing , 
they sold the piano , 
and turns out i was the only one who really had an interest in it and never got to , 
so i , 
that's one of things i felt like i missed in life 
and i really , 
in fact , uh , one of my favorite things to do now is sit down and listen to chopin , that is played on , uh , piano . 
you know , i can just drift off into some other world just listening to that for hours if i ever have the time to do that , 
oh ,    , 
maybe one of these days , i'll , 
you know , i'm kind of like you , maybe one of these days i'll get around to it , 
i'll do something with the piano , 
but probably not . 
so we both have a secret background that says somehow or another we just knew we were piano players and never got a chance , uh , 
just never got a chance to come out . 
that's the most fascinating thing .
well , it's a pleasure talking with you . 
and you , sir , 
take care . 
why don't you go first . 
um , i like to do , uh , weight training and cycling . and just walking , uh , swimming . 
i used to do a lot of basketball and running and volleyball until i had some knee surgery last fall . 
and the doctor said that running and jumping isn't real good for my knee anymore , 
so i had to kind of change my lifestyle a little bit .
how old are you ? 
oh , well then you should 
 see  over thirtyfive everything goes downhill  flop  .
well , the rest of me is in pretty good shape 
it's just that left knee that just doesn't want to do everything it used to . 
oh , you're lucky then 
because i've battled arthritis all my life , 
i mean even since i was like about two or three . 
then they diagnosed it , 
and usually most people are just absolutely crippled , 
and , uh , i do water aerobics .
oh , i bet that helps . 
i used to do it about six times a week 
and now i'm down to about four 
but it's about the only thing that keeps my mobility in there , 
uh , i tried weight training 
 and i'm telling you , i just can't lift the things . 
and the shock on the system is just too much , 
so i have stuck to water aerobics basically , you know , the weightless thing and ,
but , you know , it's hard to find . 
i mean it's really hard to find a place that's going to offer water aerobics because what i'm finding is that if they do offer it , you get the crowd of women that are ,  , 
i think they feel this is going to be an effortless  sweatless  way ,
that's right . 
that's right . 
or it's the geriatric crowd . 
that's right . 
so , i've considered even becoming licensed to teach it . 
well , i mean , if you know what your routine is , you can do that by yourself , 
and you probably do . 
but you have to have an indoor pool . 
this is true . 
so , to find an indoor pool where either you can do this by yourself without , you know , drawing a lot of looks , means you're really going to do a strenuous workout activity   
you look very odd in the water , 
well , that , 
that was the one place where i was also able to do weight training , 
and that does look very odd in the water . 
i can believe that . 
have you tried uh , the pool at the spring creek fitness center ? 
and people have told me . 
now that's the texins facility ? 
i have been told that thing is just lovely . 
it is . 
they keep it at eightyone degrees yearround . 
do you use that facility a lot ? 
uh , i try to beat the traffic in the mornings when i workout in the mornings , i try to come down to the dallas fitness center . 
do you know if they have child care there ? 
 um , have you done your attitude survey for this year yet ? 
you need to put that on there , seriously . 
they don't , 
i don't work at t i . 
oh , you don't ? 
as matter of fact i was the only woman that they had in the field in a management position 
actually when i was working there i was the only woman that was pretty much in the industry  , 
and i used to fill out those attitude surveys , 
and , uh , uh , me and the insurance adjusters are very familiar with each other 
and my husband still works there , 
and , um , i get my attitude expressed through them , 
but i find it to be very 
sometimes it's kind of shoot yourself in the foot   mentality to save a few bucks . 
this is true . 
 uh , and never having lived in texas before i starting working for t i 
and i came down here 
and , you know , they did an attitude survey like six weeks after i had been working here 
and i asked about , you know , day care for the shift workers , 
and boy i was pulled in by my manager and told that you just don't say that , you know , 
well , it's not , 
it was not applicable to me 
and i was kind of horrified . 
now what year are we talking about ? 
we're talking nineteen seventyeight . 
uh , things have become much more enlightened since then . 
they couldn't have gotten anymore in the dark ages .
you know , we still don't have a day care facility 
but people are more sympathetic to it . 
i understand that they're now covering women's preventative health care , 
and , uh , the reason i'm at home is when i had my kids , and i was scheduled to go back i tell you how much in the dark ages it was . um , i had been rated number one in the field 
and then i took , uh , 
when i became pregnant i also got meningitis ,
my gosh . 
and they put the baby on a heart lung monitor when i took her home , 
and the insurance carrier was not going to cover this because it was considered preventative treatment . 
i'm back . 
and then they used to , uh , 
and then i had a second one eighteen months later , 
they told me to put them back to back 
and , of course , to maintain 
and i was flat on my back for the last five months with the second one ,
and i don't even know it . 
of course it's real easy to take care of the first one when you're on your back . 
oh , yeah , 
very easy , 
and to try to control the labor and see how far it was going , 
and after the baby was born , since it wasn't premature , then they said they wouldn't cover the cost of the monitor . 
i think that's kind of when my husband hit the roof ,
 but after the second baby was born i was going to go back to work , 
and that was when they had , 
god it would have been the eightyfive layoff , 
 and i'll tell you how they handled this 
and i was just outraged , 
i did not know that since i was on personal leave of absence that i had been , uh , terminated until i filed my insurance claims about four months later 
and they didn't have any coverage under my name 
and i went back 
and i said what the hell is going on here , you know . 
and he's got a good salary 
we didn't think that you'd be coming back anyway , 
and , uh , you know , we've got people here that really , you know , need to be working 
and so that we had just , 
you know , it was , this way we didn't have to layoff an active person 
and we'd just let you go . 
and it took me about a year of arguing , 
and i couldn't get my , uh , termination benefits either . 
there you go . 
i was just pissed as hell that they could do that . 
i can believe that . 
 but i guess things have gotten better , 
i've been told that this flex hour and those kind of  things   , 
oh , yeah , 
flex time is great . 
i still don't think that , after my experiences that they could , you know , get me to go back , ever again .
i can understand . 
well , it's been good talking with you . 
how much is it a month ? 
oh , shoot it's only about ten bucks a month . 
now that's for individual . 
it's no big deal . 
that's it ? 
now if you pay your monthly charge , do you then pay separately for classes your taking ? 
god , that's cheap . 
it is . 
that's really cheap . 
do you have to be an active t i employee to join texans or , 
or a depe , 
or a dependent of one . 
god , i am so dependent these days . 
it's  a sense    .
oh ,   seen that my  codependents  have turned on the hose and are getting my neighbor's fence . 
so my position for management to domestic goddess has been an adjustment 
i mean , that beats any offer i've heard in a long time . 
oh , yeah , 
it's great . 
all righty . 
when you're there on weekends is it crowded as hell ? 
uh , well , it would depend on when you go 
it's not excessively crowded on the weekends . 
see i'd want to be there in the mornings like from nine thirty to ten thirty .
oh , i don't think that would be bad at all . 
if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the dallas site . 
 oh , i'm actually right on the plano line . 
oh , well , then you could go either one , 
the spring creek one is a lot more modern , has a lot more niceties , amenities 
and you'd probably like the pool there . 
oh , god it sounds like i would . 
i might do that then . 
i learned something here . 
well , good . 
i'm glad . 
you can go back to work now . 
well , thank you . 
thank you . 
you have a good day . 
uh , mostly i do needlepoint , i guess . 
oh really . 
but , um , 
what kinds of things have you done ? 
um , well , i've made a lot of baby gifts .
it seem like that's , 
like , especially lately there's been so many babies , uh , bibs and blankets , and things like that . wall hangings , um , 
do you ever keep any of your stuff ? 
isn't that funny . 
i do crochet and a lot of , uh , things like that , 
and i have very little of my own stuff , 
and it's kind of embarrassing . 
people say let me see some of your work . 
isn't that funny . 
i guess i do have one thing . 
a friend of mine gave me a clock kit 
 and , i needlepointed the face , 
and i , uh , kept that because she gave me that . 
that would be definitely something you'd want to keep . 
oh , yeah . 
and it's real neat . 
well , no , 
i guess the minute marks , 
but the minute marks are done , they're like hearts . 
and then the , 
at the numbers they're kind of outlined and stuff . 
it was quite bit of work , 
but , you know , it was a lot of fun , too . 
i really like doing stuff like that . 
i did some needlepoint years ago , 
and then i got into the bargello . 
oh , what's that ? 
well , it's an italian , um , needlework , using the uh , 
i started to say the canvas , 
but the , uh , huh , 
what kind of cloth uses that . 
i've just gone blank . 
but it's used with yarn , 
and it usually takes long stitches over two or three openings in the cloth 
 and you weave intricate patterns and use different colors . 
like it could be a flame stitch where rather than drawing a picture you're making a design like a geometric or whatever , 
and it was used quite often in the colonial times uh , uh , to upholster chairs , and so forth , as well as the crewel , um , embroidery work that was done on them . 
wow , that's interesting . 
what kind of things did you do ? 
what i did , when i was doing that was mostly pillows , you know , for sofas and so forth , 
and i can't find one that i've done . 
it's one of those things 
i didn't give them away , 
but i didn't know if it's been my color choice or multiple moves 
and it , 
i was so proud of them when i got them finished , 
but i have no idea where they are . 
what did you call that ? 
it's b , a , r , g , e , double l , o 
i've never heard of that before . 
i've probably seen it , though , 
i suspect you , 
i mean , when you described it . 
i mean , when you described it , it sounded like something , you know , that would be around , i guess . 
but , i've never heard of it before , 
and it's really interesting . 
um , i guess i've decorated baskets and stuff before in the past , 
but i've kind of gotten out of that . 
i use to do a lot more and sell at craft shows . 
me , too . 
that's interesting . 
it is . 
how did you know to choose this subject , tonight . 
that's funny .
how did you , 
what kinds of decorations did you use with the bas , 
how were you decorating the baskets ? 
oh , basically bows and lace 
um . i really wanted to do , 
you know , so many of them now have the ribbons where , i'm not sure how they do it , 
but the ribbons , they make them , they like . 
i don't know how to explain it . 
they make them hard , you know ? 
like fabric that's been stiffened . 
i've never done that , 
and those are so neat . 
i mean , i would really like to do those 
i've seen some , 
and there , they , 
i suspect they're fairly simple , because the one lady i've seen , i know that does it , i've never asked her any questions , 
but she has three kids all under the age of like six . 
and they're all a handful . 
so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily 
oh , definitely , 
when i do , um , crochet , it's usually the lacy victorian type 
and i stiffen those with a glue mixture . 
it's like white glue , 
and it may be something similar to that that the fabric is dipped in and then , um , allowed to dry in i mean , those draping streamers . 
i was just . 
there's bound to be some kind of fabric stiffener like that that's very similar 
do you know what my concern is ? 
how will i dust this thing ? 
you're right . 
that's terrible . 
that's true . 
that's funny . 
so many of my crafts , 
well , right now i'm looking at a little quilted , uh , uh , hanging , 
like , it's a flag , 
and i don't want to wash it , because that would start breaking down the batting and so forth , 
but it's such a dust collector to be out , and so forth . 
and most of my things are dust collectors .
uh , and i hate to dust . 
i know . 
so first thing i think of is how easy would this ,
that's funny .
i do some , 
i have really gotten out of it . 
i don't do it quite as much as i used to . um , i guess because i went back to school , 
so i don't have as much time . 
oh , you don't have time . 
and i have two children also .
you definitely don't have time . 
it keeps me very busy . 
but i really enjoy it when i do do it , when i get the chance , you know . 
it's really , 
it's so relaxing to just sit , 
but once i get started , i can't put it down . 
i just , 
i have a similar problem . 
i've got to have time 
or i don't even want to get into it in the first place . 
and so i end up lots of time not doing anything at all . 
i know , 
i started a project , it's been over a year ago that i swore i was going to finish for somebody for christmas . 
well , i didn't tell you what year .
what was this project ? 
um , well , it's uh , cross stitch , 
and it's a picture , 
and it's a wildlife , 
it has deer and trees 
and , it's really beautiful , 
but it's going to be a lot of work , 
and you know , i have worked on it quite a bit , but not as much as i'd like to . 
you know , it's just so hard . 
now this is done in the needlepoint ? 
well , i should , 
it's counted cross stitch , actually , is what i'm doing , 
and so since it's counted , you know , it's really a lot of work . 
i do know . 
i have done a little bit of that , 
but i decided that that's something that demands my total attention . 
and so i've got to have almost total silence . 
i can't really watch television if the pattern is very intricate . 
it sounds like you'd have lots of shading 
it does not sound like an easy one to finish . 
it really isn't , 
and i tell you , really , i could just kick myself for even starting it , because i have a feeling i'm never going to get it done . 
i'm probably going to hear about it the rest of my life .
oh , i'm sure you'll get it done , 
but it just may not of the original , 
obviously not of the original time schedule . 
that's true . 
i just don't know when i'm ever , 
it just seems like there's just never enough time to pick it up and do it , 
you know , it's just really hard . 
but i really do en , 
like i said i really enjoy it when i do . 
it's just hard . 
just hard finding the time 
and i have done , you know , in the meantime , like i said , so many baby gifts . 
i've made a lot of bibs , and wall hangings , 
and so , you know , those don't take much time at all . 
so it's no big deal for me to pick those up and do them . 
i mean , like a book of patterns , 
or do you go out an buy a kit , like for a bib or something like that . 
i have several pattern books , 
and i just go with those . 
and then i buy the bibs separate . 
usually i think it's a little bit cheaper in the long run , 
and then i just use whatever colors i want to . 
i don't usually use the colors they tell me to . 
and it depends on what it is , you know . 
but some things , especially letters , if they suggest certain colors for letters , i just go with whatever i want to . 
that's what i would do , too . 
or whatever i have . 
yeah , there's a few designs i guess i've done myself , but not very many . 
real simple ones , you know , i do . 
uh , little thumb print and made it a bunny . 
it was really easy . 
i mean , just did a thumb print . you know . 
what . with ink ? 
oh , okay . 
and then , see i didn't cross stitch the actual thumb print , 
you know , that was just the ink , 
and then i made the ears and little eyes and nose and mouth . 
that was so simple .
oh , that sounds really neat . 
it didn't take anything at all . 
did you use , like , uh , a stamp pad 
and then i just , 
so you , 
just like being finger printed  . . . 
so what kind of movies have you seen , lately , i guess ? 
um , a lot , 
well , the last movie i saw , but it wasn't my choice , was the ninja turtle movie .
obviously you have kids . 
but my preference is the one we saw before that was silence of the lambs . 
i haven't seen that one yet . 
that's an excellent movie . 
um , the last movie i saw was , uh , sleeping with the enemy . 
oh , was that good . 
i heard , 
uh , see , i'm not a big julie roberts fan . 
oh , okay . 
but i was a lot more impressed with her than i thought i would be . 
well , that's good . 
it turned out to be a better thriller than i was expecting it to be . 
it was a pretty good movie . 
silence of the lambs kept me on the edge of my seat . 
i'm ready to go . 
it just , 
it's , you know , hasn't worked out that way yet . 
you know , uh , it looks good , you know 
it is . 
and i do . 
in fact , people i've talked to said that they hadn't slept real good for a while afterwards . 
so  , 
oh , i love them like that . 
i'm not , 
i mean , i like all ranges of movies , 
 but i like that where they run tense . 
i really enjoy , 
they keep me guessing the whole time . 
it was really interesting . 
well , what other movies have you seen then lately ? 
other than the , 
i assume you were talking about the new ninja turtles . 
the new one , of course .
is that any good , 
i mean , i'm sure i'm going to be seeing it because in a week to amarillo where my sister lives , and she's got two boys that i took to see the first one . 
so i'm sure i'm going to see the next one here real soon . 
amarillo . 
i didn't see the first one . 
my husband said it was , um , about the same lines . 
oh , well , then it won't be too bad . 
so , yeah . 
you know , it wasn't impressive necessarily , 
but it was better than it could have been . 
and i was impressed with the fact that , um , it wasn't that childish . 
you know what i mean . 
it wasn't , 
my daughter's five , 
i mean she understood everything . 
she goes to almost all movies with us except , you know , r rated . 
and she really enjoyed it , 
but it was on a higher level , you know , where there were some things that kids didn't understand that adults did , 
and i liked that . 
i think that's important if uh , parents are going to have to go 
that's right , 
it's pretty good . 
but we take her to just about every movie , 
and , uh , she does really good . 
we've taken her from real young , 
and she does real good . 
like i said , we don't take her to r s . 
so , if and when we ever get a babysitter , like we did with silence of the lambs , we go see it . 
i's about to say , you're not going to take her to that one , i'm sure . 
oh , no , 
or do you go to a lot of comedy movies 
or to , 
what was the last comedy you saw ? 
 oh gosh what was the last comedy we saw ? 
 huh , huh , huh . good question , 
we don't get to go that often , 
but something on the tip of my tongue , 
and i can't think of which one it was . 
uh . gosh , i can't remember . 
the last , uh , 
in fact i guess this was the last movie i saw 
i said that wrong , 
the last movie i saw was the hard way with michael j . fox . 
but that sounds good . 
well , that really wasn't too bad . 
there were , 
you know , he's supposed , 
you know , he's this actor , right 
 and he's playing a cop . 
or he's hanging around with a cop trying to pick up the stuff . 
i think he did an excellent job in not being too much of a cop . 
oh , okay . 
i mean , like , he'd be running with a gun or whatever . 
he didn't look like a cop when he did it . 
and i was so 
that's neat . 
the part was hard , to do that . 
oh yeah , 
because , i mean , everybody grows up looking at these cop movies and trying you know , to imitate them or whatever . 
and , uh , i thought he did such an excellent job of not 
now , by the end he was looking more like a cop .
but he wasn't there yet . 
and you could tell it , 
and i guess that i thought was a real good acting and writing job both , you know , or directing job . 
i think they did a real good job of that . 
and james woods , i think is who it was , did an excellent job as the cop . 
i mean , you know , he just , 
i like him . 
and there were some definite , um , should i say , tense moments ,
probably the last comedy we saw , now that i think about it , is home alone . 
i had seen it before christmas , 
but i took a date to it , uh , about a month ago . 
so , i've seen it the second time not too long ago . 
it was really cute . 
i really enjoyed it . 
of course , the bad thing about it was , uh , the second time i saw it , i didn't really enjoy it as much , 
and i was kind of surprised at that . 
i thought that would be one of those that i would love to watch over and over . 
but before , 
maybe it's just the idea of my reaction to the first time . i had laughed so hard i was hoarse . 
i was hoarse getting out of there . 
and maybe i just laughed so hard the first time that i didn't have it , 
i mean , it just wasn't as funny the second time 
i don't know 
maybe so , 
i mean , it was a great movie though . 
i loved the movie . 
i did , too . 
i'm looking forward to this summer , uh , naked gun two and a half is coming out . 
i love those movies . 
i do too . 
i mean , they are just slapstick .
oh , yeah . 
you have to see those twice to catch everything . 
well , you have to see them more than that . 
i still catch things in airplane that i didn't catch . 
i mean , it's amazing 
i do too . 
i love those movies 
i do too . 
i really do . 
so i'm looking forward to seeing that 
oh yeah . 
well ,  , we try to go a couple times a month , i guess 
it's just getting so expensive . 
oh , isn't it though . 
you know , but that's at least the good thing about the texas organization letting you buy the tickets cheaper . 
but normally we don't think about it until , 
that's exactly what ,
i keep not doing it until after i'm there 
i know , because we can go spend fifteen dollars 
and then if you want popcorn and stuff 
i don't understand why they charge you out the kazoo for both . 
you know popcorn is not that expensive . 
nowhere near that expensive . 
so they get you at the ticket booth and then try and get you at the popcorn and coke . 
and , uh , these actors , you know , live in such lavish style . 
i mean , it's as simple as that . 
we just keep breeding them . 
and as long as we keep paying the money for it , they are going to keep paying them . 
i guess so . 
now have you seen dances with wolves ? 
oh , that was an excellent movie . 
i haven't seen , 
we're waiting for the video . 
no , 
that needs the big screen . 
it really and truly does , because to get the feeling 
oh really ? 
you really truly do . 
i would , 
i mean , i guess my first instinct was to wait for the video , too . 
but i'm glad i didn't . 
i really and truly am . 
i mean , that was one movie i came out impressed . 
i really and truly did . 
i mean , i have absolutely no problems with them winning seven oscars . 
none at all . 
normally i'm one of these people that i don't like one movie taking all the honors . 
i wanted him to win best actor on top of it , 
he was , 
yeah , oh . 
like i said , i wouldn't given the supporting actresses either one . 
but even though they were okay , the girl in it , 
somebody made an interesting observation , 
now that i think back on it , i'd say yeah , i can't believe that either . 
she was the only indian to have her hair done at all times . 
it was just too perfect at all times . 
that was a mistake that they made . 
they shouldn't have done it . 
now the best , 
the supporting actor , he was good , 
but from what i heard , the guy who got it was better , 
so you know , i can see that . 
but , oh , 
you think my daughter would like it ? 
oh , okay . 
but , um , it's 
she doesn't mind when we cover up her eyes . 
no problems .
the hides . 
so there's , 
see , honest to god the one reason i don't want to see the movie 
but , well , 
 and i know they're fake . 
and , well , yeah , 
that , and plus , i mean part of it is the idea that he goes with them on a buffalo hunt . 
so , i mean , they are killing buffalos in it . 
but they don't stress that very much , 
they really don't . 
and i think it's an excellent movie for , 
if she enjoys movies i think it'll work pretty good . 
oh , that'll be good . 
we really need some , 
my husband keeps wanting to . 
it's a long movie . 
and i heard the video's even going to be longer . 
oh yeah . 
they did a lot of stuff that they cut out . 
i may have to see the video . 
  that's true , 
they said , 
i hadn't even thought of that . 
they said there's a lot that had been edited , because of the length 
so they're going to put it in the video . 
and that way you can watch it at your leisure . 
well , yeah , 
i kind of like it when they do that , because the video , like i said , 
there are certain things you can't do with a video 
 and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea . 
because i mean when you rent a video , 
videos , of course , are not cheap either 
 and so the idea of getting a little extra with it i think is a good idea . because they make bundles of money off those things . 
we have cable which 
oh , i do too . 
but not enough . 
we keep holding out , you know . 
i'm getting to the point where , you know , well i watch nick at night . 
do you have .
had to mess with my phone here . 
um , do you have children ? 
oh , okay . 
how about you ? 
i have three . 
oh , my goodness .
 uh , do you work ? 
i work 
and , uh , brian's in a day care center . 
uh , he was two in december , 
so he's not quite two and a half yet . 
uh , i put him , 
i'm kind of had different ideas from what probably the majority of people have , 
i put him in a day care center from the very beginning . 
he started in day care when he was eight weeks old . 
oh , no kidding . 
and i just , 
i don't know , 
i have kind of the opposite opinion of most people , 
i have had this real problem with a private individual . 
i mean with private individual , when the door shuts ,
 and i always figured at least in a day care center there are other people around , 
 and if you get one bad apple , there's are at least other people that can see it . 
they can watch , 
because there's , 
 you know , how can you help depending on the day care center , you know , 
you got to when you hear about all the horrible things that happen in day care centers , 
have you ever noticed they're always like a family owned center where the mother and the daughter and the son run it , you know , kind of thing . 
it's like a family thing . 
you never hear about it really in the big ones . 
so , that's what i did 
and i have had just excellent luck . 
 oh , good . 
i have been just so happy . 
oh , good . 
i was just going to ask you the , 
but obviously you do or you wouldn't have him there , i know , 
well he was in the same center for two years , 
and , uh , it was wonderful , 
and i loved it , 
and i was so happy there 
and the woman who owned it sold it . 
oh , gosh . 
 but , i thought okay , i'm going to keep an open mind here , 
and the people who came in , it ,
wasn't the same . 
and their , 
and i left him there for about a month and just decided i can't do this anymore , 
and i ,
was it ? 
he's been there ,
and i just feel so lucky . 
oh , good . 
that's great , 
that's good . 
how about you ? 
do you work 
or do you get to stay home with them ? 
well , i got to stay home with my kids for the first ten years . 
my oldest one is ten and a half now ,
was about ten years . 
so i was really happy that i was able to do that . 
but , i , 
that's what i wanted to , because uh , you know i just couldn't wait to have kids 
and so , if i was , 
i was so anxious to have them 
and i couldn't wait to have them it would be kind of silly , you know , to go back to work as soon as i had them , 
so , it was really great . 
by the end of the ten years i was really ready  ,
i bet .
and my youngest was only , uh , two and a half .
i mean she was already two and a half , 
 so you know , she wasn't an infant . 
a baby . 
so , i felt real good about that , 
but , uh , boy , i tell you with summer coming up i'm just pulling my hair out , in terms of what i'm going to do , 
i guess i ,
and , uh , i worked full time all last year 
and now i'm going to school part time and , uh , graduate school , 
and i'm working part time .
 and , so i'm still , 
i know how that goes .
i'm still going full time , 
but i only have half time salary , 
and , uh , when school lets out , i just don't , 
did you have them in a center or something last summer ? 
we had all different things , 
we sent them to camp . 
first month , in june , they went to summer school , then the second month they , 
uh , one , 
my daughter went home to visit my mom for a while and my son , uh , went to camp 
and there we had , uh , i don't know some , 
forget what else we did 
but it was all , uh , really expensive .
that stuff is expensive . 
it really is . 
so , now they're a year older , 
and i , 
my daughter's going to be eleven this summer 
and my son will be ,
 and so , 
i think i can leave them home , 
for a , 
if i can work part of the day , you know , i'm going to leave them home . 
i was going to say they're getting to the age where ,
in fact i'm doing that right now with their afternoons , when they get home before i do . you know , 
that's okay . 
but , the four year old now or before i went back to work really , in a home day care situation , 
and , uh , we've just been really thrilled ,
we were what , 
actually we , 
it took us two or three different people to find , 
to find the right one , 
that's what we have to do though . 
but , i wasn't embarrassed to shop around you know , 
 so , the person we found it through the , 
there's an association here in town of professional home ,
where do you live ? 
in plano . 
plano ? 
and all these people are registered with their association 
and , you know , go like our , uh , 
i don't want to call her a babysitter , 
she's doesn't like ,
care provider . 
care provider . 
she goes to seminars 
and , uh , 
 oh , that's wonderful . 
she gets home visitations by the   i don't know , the state boards , i guess , some of them and then some by the association , 
and they have weekly meetings and everything 
and , so it's just really , really well regulated . 
that's great . 
and , she's just great . 
in fact , uh , she's all upset because galen is going to go to kindergarten next fall 
 you know , i'm not going to have her anymore 
after noon classes she's going to be here because she's going to morning kindergarten . 
we've tried everything 
and one year , i guess last year when i went back to work i had 
my son was eight at the time , just barely eight , 
and , uh , we put him in amrein's day care , after . 
i've heard that ,
well , that's why we picked it , because they were supposed to be real great , 
and , you know , i think they were fine , 
but the thing is he was in school all day ,
in plano , it's open classroom situation where they don't have walls , 
so there is like a hundred and twenty second graders  ,
 uh , and then he'd get on the amrein's bus to go to amrein's 
and then there would be a whole ton of other kids , all in the same room , you know , 
you know what fun they had with these computer games 
and then they'd go outside for awhile , 
they had snacks and story time and everything . 
but , it was just like going to school until five thirty at night instead of being able to get home at two thirty . 
poor kid was in school all day . 
because he was always around with a crowd of kids he just really missed being able to be by himself ,
 or , you know . 
even at that age they need that time , 
we all need that time ,
that's exactly it . 
so , another thing that we tried to do , 
i know your son's too young right now , 
but we tried to sign him up for after school scouts and ,
i think that's really important , 
and we've already started about , 
you know , i mean , how young can they start tball and soccer ? .
you know , i mean , i just , 
you know , we both think of that as just so important ,
it is . 
it is . 
i mean , he's so much fun now , 
 he's really starting to get lots of fun 
and i can't wait until stuff like that starts happening 
i bet , 
 you know , and , you know , we did the easter egg hunts ,
 and to know what he was doing 
and it was so much fun 
and gosh he went a couple of weekends ago and rode an elephant 
and , god 
 oh , my gosh . 
you're kidding . 
and lord , i couldn't believe it . 
you're kidding . 
they had so much fun . .
oh , that's great . 
i bought us tickets and stood there in line 
and i thought , i'm going to end up on this elephant with him  ,
he did it by himself , 
 well , good for him . 
 so stuff like that is starting to come along where it's really ,
day care has just done just incredible stuff with him 
and he like comes home with something new everyday , you know 
and so , 
 well , that's great . 
 that's so good . 
and he's excited to get there in the morning ,
and he goes running , 
he's out of there . 
and he's always having fun when i pick him up 
so , you know . yeah , 
it's bright steps in lewisville . 
 and it's one of those that's very hard to get into . 
and this woman owns three day cares , two in lewisville and one in irving . 
and she had to open the second one up in lewisville because ,
it was ridiculous . 
 oh , my gosh . 
and , she's got two day cares within like three blocks of each other . 
no kidding . 
so its , 
she knows something right , that she   
she knows what she's doing , 
like about half the teachers are degreed teachers . 
that makes such a difference . 
 oh , it makes a huge difference . 
that's the way it is at my daughter's nursery school too . 
and i think that really makes a difference . 
they're in it because it's a profession ,
that's right . 
that's right . 
and , his old day care as much as i loved it , you know , 
and the owner , i really liked her 
and she worked really hard to get good people , 
but the people that she got 
 and i got lucky 
and all of his teachers were ,
sometimes that's fine , 
that's great , you know . 
 but then sometimes , you know , 
sometimes it isn't . 
you just have to . 
well , is it real expensive then ? 
um , it just went up the first of this month . 
i'm paying ,
it's a little high , 
 you know , it's like where he was before i was only paying sixty three , 
so there's quite a little jump there , 
but , i looked all over lewisville , 
i looked in every day care there was 
but is it , 
you know , your peace of mind is worth a little bit of money , 
and i have peace of mind ,
 and some of those other places i wouldn't have . 
that's exactly it . 
see , we do the same thing , 
since galen goes to nursery school ,
but she's gone three mornings . 
galen just doesn't go there three mornings a week . 
when school holidays come around , i used to have such a problem with that . 
they wouldn't have anything to do . 
i'd either have to  , 
well , have you ever , uh , had a family reunion ? 
this is a really neat thing to do too , that they did , 
i didn't do it . 
some of the older people organized it . 
and , what they did , they had , uh , a book made up 
and it was like ,
no kidding . 
and , then what they did was they asked every family to write something about their family .
and , you know , it went through like , 
and it showed uh , well , who my husband's parents were , you know . 
and it went through the whole family and stuff . 
oh , that's so neat . 
and , it was so good . 
oh , great .
but it really did , 
you know , plus it's got a lot more people interested in it because ,
 so did everybody send in their information and they made a book up ,
and then you could get it at the reunion . 
and , everybody got a book ,
 oh , nice . 
and , it told like , uh , you know , where the first connallys came over , 
and , um , it told what happened when they got there and how many kids they had 
and it just kept coming on up through the generations . 
 so , that was really neat . 
that is neat . 
so , do you have a big family ? 
oh , he does ? 
i don't . 
but , uh , he has enough relatives to make up for me not having any .
i are . 
i have a kind of a big family 
and he just has himself and his brother and his parents , 
and that's it . 
so , he had to kind of get used to us when we first started going together . 
when i first , uh , met my husband . 
nobody can have this many relatives , 
because a lot of them lived in like a group , you know , down one highway . 
and , there was a lake , 
and they all lived down there by it . 
oh , how nice . 
and , so , we were going down ,
and he kept saying , this is where my uncle lives 
and this is where my aunt lives and my uncle , 
 oh , my gosh . 
and i kept thinking , this guy is putting me on . 
nobody has this many relatives , you know .
how funny . 
and , another thing that's really good about , uh , family reunions ,
but you had a choice 
and then you got to taste a lot of new dishes and stuff too ,
everybody might not like that . 
not be able to do it . 
so , did people come like from out of town to the reunion 
oh , yeah . 
they did . 
they came from all over . 
did you put them up in other people's houses 
or did you have hotel rooms , 
or , how did you do it ? 
um , they just stayed with different ones of them . 
they did . 
they just came down and like say , okay , this aunt and uncle kip , uh , all their kids and their grand kids and everything , 
and then , 
it had gotten so big that they had it at the church . 
oh , really ? 
and , they had a church service ahead of it , 
you know , and uh , 
how nice . 
and they just brought food with them ? 
did they just have like over a weekend ? 
is that how they did it ? 
uhhuh . 
well , i'm real curious because my family , 
it didn't sound , 
i don't think my family is as big as your husband's . 
i don't think we'd need a whole church , 
but , um , the problem is we are all really scattered ,
there isn't any one place where most of us live , 
so if we ever had a reunion , we'd kind of all have to stay in a hotel . 
i mean , you know , there would be one person who lived there that would have a house , 
but they couldn't put everybody up . 
so i think it would get kind of expensive . 
but , you know what you can do ? 
a lot of these lakes and things , if you could find a centrally located , like , say about the same distance for all of you all to come ? 
they have these places where you can rent them 
and it , you know , like on a lake , 
like , uh , it's a big place , 
i mean , you know , 
and , it's not very expensive that way . 
oh , you mean 
oh , i see , 
so everybody could stay together ? 
it's like a , 
a house or something . 
and , then it has little rooms off of it where ,
but , then it has like a kitchenette and things like that 
but you , 
see , that would be great because then you could spend so much more time together ,
 and another , 
 and then , every time you wanted to go eat with somebody , you'd probably have to go to out , eat or something . 
it would run into a lot of money . 
but , they had , 
that was , 
you know , that , 
that sounds like fun . 
what you can do is , you can write different places , the chamber of commerce ,
ask them what they have ,
because now every time we plan anything , just about , we write to the chamber of commerce of where we're going because ,
you get a , 
calling different places can really run you up a bill . 
but , if you can find a centrally located place where everybody would have to come about the same distance , 
i mean , you can't get it exact , you know , usually , 
 oh , yeah . 
uh , and then everybody goes to that place . 
and that is not bad at all . 
but , lot of times they'll have like , uh , little cabins , 
and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have , you know , just the single bunk beds and stuff . 
and , they can all stay in those cabins . 
and then , you know , you can have cookouts and stuff like that 
that doesn't cost you as much . 
that would be great . 
that would be really nice .
but , uh , you know , that's the best way i found ,
that sounds good . 
now we had one , 
this was before i lost a lot more of my family , 
but it wasn't any of my immediate family anyway . 
but , um  , 
but , i didn't think that was as good . because , 
this was like everybody came into town and went to this restaurant . 
and you have to sit at a table and just , 
and , it just , 
i didn't like that much . 
well , um , did you , 
was it hard to decide who to invite and who not to invite . 
i mean , did you have to draw a line , 
or did the people that had that reunion have to draw a line ? 
like , they just 
whoever  ,
what they did was , 
then those in turn got a hold of these other ones . 
and they had like , 
i think there was four or five different people ,
and , you know , 
and then , uh , you know , to get the information and all ,
and you had to check off what all you would be willing to bring . 
oh , i see . 
and , so , really there wasn't any problem with , 
that's the reason it ended up in a church because ,
but , it turned out so much better like that .
now if there was a sickness or something like that , i mean , you know , you're not going to lose 
no that would just be a few . 
but how about like because of divorce and stuff like that ? 
like my parents are divorced , 
okay well , 
 and they are both remarried 
and , you know , i mean , there's , 
i don't know . 
well , see , then 
if you wanted them both to come ,
and you would have been the one that sent their invitation to them ,
so then , 
to send back to those other people . 
i'm kind of like , in control over who comes . uh , just from my family . 
because once it went to then they knew who they wanted to invite , 
then , they sent their little things to us . 
it was up to me ,
i see . 
that's a pretty good idea to do it that way . 
 and then , you know , it never did , 
like if i didn't want somebody to come , then i just wouldn't send them one of the questionnaires . 
so there really wasn't a problem that way . 
well , that's a real good idea . 
but , i tell you what , that's the neatest book we've got , 
i bet . 
course we've still got it 
and they charged us , i think like , it was like five or six dollars , i can't remember 
and oh , like a , you know , folder type thing . 
but it has the entire , 
you know , it has everybody that you could ever imagine ,
how neat . 
i know , that's really neat . 
and , it will be something my kids will have , you know . 
just like , 
i was just thinking of that . 
because if you stop and think , 
i don't know if you're like me , 
but i know very little about before my grandparents . 
i mean , very little about it . 
i just , 
the thing is i know a lot of stories , 
but i can't remember who it was about . 
my grandparents told us when i was growing up and even when i was an adult 
they still tell all kinds of stories about their parents and their cousins and their best friends , cause they all grew up in new york city , 
but you know , i remember these stories 
but i have no idea who it was that was in those stories . 
so , i mean , i couldn't give an accurate , 
i couldn't tell my kids what , you know , those people were like , 
i just remember they had some funny stories , 
but i don't know who it was . 
maybe what you could do if you couldn't get into a full family reunion ,
but then usually when you find out some information from like your parents ,
uh , what kind of camping is there in texas ? 
well , i guess , state parks , 
and there's a couple of national parks , i guess , that you can camp at . 
um , most of them have pretty good facilities . 
i don't know if the camping that i've done is really roughing it without a whole lot of stuff . 
so , you do , uh , like backpacking and the like ? 
i've been to a couple in texas 
and there's some real nice ones in arkansas . 
um , i think arkansas has one of the best parks departments around . 
is the ozarks in arkansas ? 
so , that's probably a pretty nice place to go .
one of them , uh ,  the gray   , i think that's one of the ones we've been to , it's real nice there , a bunch of lakes around it , 
there's a golf course and , um , just a whole bunch of camping sites . 
what about you , 
where have you , uh , 
oh , i've been camping for years , not on a regular basis 
but , uh , i first started camping out in the desert in california .
and , uh , then i moved to north carolina 
and i didn't camp for a long time , 
and then i started to , uh , go camping again kind of in conjunction with white water rafting , 
so , i'd go up somewhere and camp overnight and then do some rafting . 
and then maybe camp another night and drive home . 
and uh , that was pretty good 
so , i went out and bought a whole bunch of camping gear 
and , uh , you know , i still do it once in a while . 
i think we've collected stuff off and on over the years . 
the more times we did it , the more serious we get about it . 
where is raleigh , in north carolina ? 
uh , well , a little more towards the northern border of the state and pretty much in the eastern half of it . 
so what i , 
 are  you kind of away from the blue ridge mountains , 
well , it , 
an area . 
actually the blue ridge in virginia are closer to raleigh . 
they're about three hours away if you go due north . 
um ,  of  
the blue ridge in north carolina i think are much nicer 
and you can pick those up going west , 
but then you're talking about six to eight hours . 
the way it works . 
but , um , it's a real nice place to go and camp , 
and there's some pretty decent campgrounds  although   , i don't think the state of north carolina takes , 
they probably just don't spend as much money as a lot of other states might . 
my wife's from the western part of virginia , 
we've been down the parkway a lot , 
but i didn't know how much camping areas there were along there . 
i think there's quite a few . 
i can't say i've checked them all out though . 
what's it like camping in the desert and california , 
that seems ,
it's really , really nice . 
um , i like it better than almost anything i've ever done . 
just the sky is so amazing . 
you know , you really can probably count thousands of stars , 
and , uh , it's just kind of nice . 
i like the , uh , 
i think the desert has a rare kind of beauty which , uh , a lot of people don't realize , 
you know , they hear desert 
and they think of scorpions and snakes and sand and being real dry , and lack of water , 
course it , it has all of those qualities 
but it also has a certain quality of beauty that you just don't find anyway else except in a desert . 
so , it's pretty nice . 
some nice desert scenes , 
those guys all go camping out in the desert . 
of course , they drag a lot of drugs with them 
but , um , are pretty nice 
and it's sort of like that , 
i mean , it's just almost surreal , in some places . 
it's very pleasant . 
are the temperatures real extreme there 
or the , 
i mean , you sort of have to choose your season carefully and know what's going to happen . 
 i've been  camping in death valley , 
one doesn't go in july .
but it's beautiful in february . 
i mean , it's just beautiful . 
the days , get up into the high eighties , uh , maybe the nineties 
but it's quite bearable 
and then the nights are reasonably warm , you know , sixties or seventies . 
it's just great . 
it's really very nice . 
we've talked about planning a trip up through , um , 
i have a sisterinlaw that lives up through new mexico and into colorado and the grand canyon area . 
i don't know when i'm going to get a chance to do that 
well , that would be pretty nice . 
i have been camping on the south rim the grand canyon . 
that's okay . 
a lot of people like to go down and camp down inside , 
i was just too lazy that trip to do all that walking ,
 i'll bet  .
 that  one thing you said about the stars is really true 
when you're close to a big city like dallas , the lights kind of wash , 
oh , yeah . 
so it's nice to get away . 
it's just amazing ,
it really is . 
i mean , i don't think i ever see the little dipper , 
you hear people talk about the little dipper . 
huh . hhuh . 
but i don't think i ever see it except when i go get out of the city and go camping in the desert or in the mountains . 
otherwise it's just too faint .
well , thanks for calling , 
nice talking to you . 
it was good talking to you  robert  .
well , stephanie , what's your position on gun control ? 
well , on a scale of one to ten , uh , being ten , no , kind of legislation and zero being , uh , total ban , i probably would lean more towards six or seven . 
um , i feel like a total ban on guns is just going to put the guns in the hands the criminals . 
um , i lived in massachusetts for two years 
and they have a total ban on guns 
and i saw that , it didn't stop crime in that state . 
any kind of firearms . 
uh , it's , 
there's was a mandatory jail sentence if you were caught , um , with a firearm 
and also i think there was a fine . 
and that didn't help at all ? 
i don't , 
the crime is not any better or any worse , 
i mean it's , 
i shouldn't say i don't know if it was any worse , 
but it certainly didn't get any better . 
i usually just , 
i'm trying to think of , 
i guess i would tend myself to be more towards the , like three ,
but you should definitely have the character search and the seven day holding period and things along that nature , uh , 
you know , you shouldn't be able to go out there and just buy one you know , right off the shelf . 
i agree with that . 
are way too lax . 
i think that the , 
 and , so , i think that kind of control would be good , 
but the , uh , 
just to kind of exam it a little bit 
and i know that any statement in absoluteness is not necessarily true , uh , 
only the guns were in the hands of the criminals , 
but how many times , 
i guess i have never heard of a robbery being foiled or spoiled because the person who's being robbed had a gun . 
um , i , 
and maybe they just don't report those 
or i'm not sure 
or , you know , i can't think of ever hearing on the news or whatnot or hearing or knowing anybody who was being robbed 
but good thing they had their gun on them 
and they thwarted the robbery attempt . 
i'm not really sure , 
personally i don't own a gun , 
um , and i don't think i probably ever would , um , although i would like to know how to handle one , 
and i think everybody should learn how to handle one . 
um , you just never know when you might come into contact with one . 
were you brought up in a family that hunted 
uh , nobody in my family hunted , 
uh , my father had guns when i was in high school because he got them from a friend who lived in massachusetts .
we lived in new hampshire at the time . 
how about that . 
and he lived in massachusetts and had to get rid of all his guns , 
so we ended up , uh , with these guns , 
and really my only experience with a gun was shooting a pistol and not knowing how to hold it right 
and the hammer came back and hit me in the thumb and blood squirted everywhere . 
oh , jeez . 
and so that was really the only experience that i've had with guns 
and it , 
but i think that if i learn how to use one , i would feel better . 
i've also always thought about the idea , you know , most sports , you know , which are the n r a and people  have  their thing , you know , 
if you ban guns , you're just banning the recreation , the sport of hunting , things of that nature . 
most of that's done with rifles and such . uh , though there's , you know , probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns . 
but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns , would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous , 
you couldn't be inconspicuous ,
you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately , you know , 
 if they had to have a rifle or was , 
you know , made it more difficult to get uh , a handgun . 
now of course , you know , in this world anytime you've freedom you can be able to get anything you want . 
that's true . 
but i guess to make it more difficult for the person who's just so irate and upset and , you know , temporarily a little bit , uh , offset or off keel , 
i don't know if that's a large percentage of , uh , crime or not 
but i guess it would be some . 
but i think definitely , 
like today they just introduced what's called the brady bill . the seven day mandatory waiting period ,
 and i think that , 
i would definitely support that . 
definitely want some sort of legislation 
and coming from the north east , i'm just not used to seeing , um , these , 
and i know this may sound kind of stereo typical 
but the cowboys with the gun racks in the back of their trucks .
oh , sure . 
that kind of , to me it is more like  vigilantism  .
you know , and it kind of scares me especially with all the shootings that have been going on ,
that's crazy .
 and then you come here in the dallas area , um , 
i don't believe that people should be allowed to carry guns in their vehicles .
that's kind of wild . 
well , that's all very interesting .
well , thanks for talking . 
sure you're welcome . 
well , actually i'm a dodgers fan from way back . 
how way back , i mean 
like , um , late fifties , early sixties . 
so wally moon moon shots and all that . 
what's that ? 
coliseum , wally moon and all that . 
it's a , um , 
just west of baltimore , and frederick , um , which is also just west of baltimore , has a minor league team . 
 uh , and , wally moon is the manager of them . 
is that right ? 
that's interesting . 
uh , going away to college , 
and i used to go watch the toledo mudhens . 
oh , i saw them , 
um , um , i was out there last summer , 
and i saw a game at ned skelton . 
is that the stadium ? 
uh , i couldn't tell you for sure . 
it's been a long time . 
oh , okay . 
so , um , there used to be a , uh , race track . 
it was , 
that was impression i got when i was there 
i think that's right . 
so had a lot of fun 
actually , i mean , i like minor league baseball , a lot . 
it's cheaper for one thing .
well , that's true . 
i think , i've kind of become a rangers fan over the last eleven years since i've been here . 
uh , they've led the american league in batting , fielding and pitching , 
but they've never been able to do more than one of those in any given year . 
i think they're in for a odd year this year , 
actually , um , they , um , 
i don't understand why encovilla got released . 
i don't either . 
i mean , the guy's twenty , twentyfive home rums , maybe thirty , eighty some r b is . 
i mean , you know , he can't field 
and , you know , he strikes out a lot , 
but , i mean , he's done that for five years . 
why get rid of him now ? 
a very decent fielder . 
oh , yes . 
he's not that he used to be . 
oh , okay . 
oh , he fits right in i mean with detroit , bunch of guys that hit home runs and strike out a lot . 
of course , get a guy like cecil fielder , you know , 
if he strikes out a lot , so what . 
well , i mean , with detroit , i mean , they can get away with one guy like that . 
i mean , if i were in detroit , i would start building the team around fielder . 
oh , yeah . 
but that doesn't mean get three other guys who hit , all they can do is hit home runs and strike out 
well , i think the key for l a this year is whether oral herschiser can come back . 
i think the pitching's deep enough that it doesn't matter . 
it may be . 
i like them a lot . 
i think they're going to go all the way . 
um , and , i mean , by saying i like them , i like their chances . 
i actually don't like the dodgers , 
i'm a giants fan 
well , picking up darrell strawberry didn't hurt . 
but butler didn't hurt either . 
uh , and bobby ojeda didn't hurt 
uh , who's the last one . 
bobby ojeda . 
they got him from the mets for hubie brooks . 
oh , okay . 
um , he's a pretty decent pitcher . 
yes he is . 
you know , he   .
and , uh , that guy    , the short stop , is going to be good . 
well it should be an interesting year . 
i'm looking , 
i've already been to one game , 
and i should have been to two 
are you an orioles fan ? 
but , um , i go to the orioles since they're here , 
and you know , i do enjoy them . 
um , i've had an opening day on monday . 
you know , i kind of wish that they had inter league play , like they do in all the other sports so i could see some of the national league teams here once in a while . 
  how far is houston ? 
uh , three hundred miles . 
oh , okay , 
keep forgetting how big states are out there sometimes . 
it's incredible . 
i , um , 
you know , we're pretty lucky because if i want to see a national league team , i can usually go up to philadelphia . 
there you go . 
and , um , saw the cardinals and cubs last year , and a bunch of teams the year before . 
uh , yeah .
um , i try to see whatever i can . 
i mean , i've been to like thirty or forty games each of the last few years . 
hope i'm going to do it this year because , um , uh , having a kid this fall , 
so it's like 
all right . 
so do it while you can . 
well , it's been good talking with you . 
and you'll be happy i think in october when the dodgers win . 
i wouldn't mind it . 
i'll be upset probably even though my prediction will be right .
well , god bless 
and good talking with you . 
take care . 
i'm trying to think what i've seen lately . 
i me , we , 
well we just finished watching , uh , teenage mutant ninja turtles on tape , you know .
did you watch dances with wolves , 
did you see the movie ? 
did you like it ? 
have you seen it ? 
i thought it was very well done . 
i , um , 
how about ghost ? 
we saw , an , we liked it 
but , you know , i didn't think it was as good as all the , uh , hype was about it . 
i feel the same way about that too . 
it was okay . 
i don , 
i couldn't see it worth getting a nomination for , uh , best picture . 
and , uh , wh , 
let's see , uh , 
the most recent ones that i've seen are those two , ghost and , uh , dances with wolves , 
but i rent , uh , uh , videos , 
do you ? 
and so we just , 
you watch many ? 
uh , um , you know , it depends on wh , 
do you like the classics like , uh , gone with the wind and , uh , you know the older movies . 
that are classics , you know . 
because i've never seen citizen kane , 
that was good . 
 and i've never seen casablanca and never seen gone with the wind . 
i think i've seen most of humphrey bogart's movies , but , in , you know a long time ago , 
 and , uh , like the maltese falcon and all those , uh , uh , 
oh , i def , 
we saw part of the african queen on t v a couple of years ago , 
that was good , 
 and i've been wanting to see all of it 
but you know , we walk into the video store 
it's true . 
but , um , i think , 
one of the movies we saw recently , we saw , uh , misery . 
oh , i didn't see that one . 
that was good , um , 
 oh , it was great . 
and it , 
you think , you know , because it was by stephen king it would be really gory 
but there's only one , 
well there's a couple scenes , there is , you know some blood and everything 
and there's one really bad scene where i mean , there's not blood but it's pretty graphic .
but um , it's a really good movie , um . 
is that the one where , uh , the guy gets captured by that women ? 
he's a writer 
and , um , she's his biggest fan 
and she's also  ,
did you see pacific heights ? 
i saw that one , 
that one wasn't that great either . 
oh , it wasn't ? 
i got , 
i heard like mixed reviews , um , of that , 
we s , 
how about silence of the lambs ? 
that's on our list of things to see .
i know , 
i wanted to see , 
i was curious if you had seen it 
and that , uh , 
our big thing is , um , 
you know , movie prices up here 
i think it's like six bucks now in the theaters , 
   you know . so it's like , 
you know , a lot of things we try to catch like at the dollar theater or matinees 
and then a lot of other stuff we just wait until it comes out on tape . 
that's us too , 
i know , it's too bad that they've gotten so expensive . 
well one movie we saw in the last couple of months that we really enjoyed was , uh , edward scissorhands . 
oh , really . 
have you seen that ? 
oh , it was great .
it was , 
i thought it was kind of maybe for kids more , than ad , 
um , it's an odd film 
and it's really interesting that , 
i like the director a lot , um , a guy named tim burton . 
did you ever see the movie beetlejuice ? 
 oh , ok , 
oh , se , 
well if you liked beetlejuice you'll probably like edward scissorhands , 
if you didn't like beetlejuice you'll probably won't like edward scissorhands . 
oh , really . 
it's , um , 
burton's kind of , uh , e , 
he's , a very odd man 
but he's , 
i think he's very interesting 
and , uh , i liked those two movies of his a lot . 
he did batman also , which , you know .
that was pretty good , though , really . 
it was good , 
but i mean , he was , um , 
when you think of what it takes to make some of those kind of movies , you know . 
you see it for , uh , you know a couple of hours or an hour 
and it really , 
there's a lot in it when you look at the scenery and the cars ,
 oh , yeah , oh . 
whose your favorite actress or actor ? 
um , don't really know , 
i like costner a lot 
but , uh , 
so , you know , after bull durham and field of dreams , you know , 
 um , although , you know , 
that was good , 
i saw that movie too . 
that was very good . 
which one ? 
field of dreams . 
field of dreams was good , 
um , and , i think , i liked the other movies he's done . 
no way out was really good 
 oh , yeah , 
did you ever see silverado ? 
silverado , 
uh , who was that with ? 
um , let's see . 
danny glover , scott glen , kevin kline , um , brian  dennehy   , jeff goldblum's in . 
uh , john  kreas  is in it if you don't blink . 
the nam , 
the title sounds familiar , 
i'm trying to thi , 
it was a big western , 
i mean , i think roseanne  arquett  was in it too , another one that if you blink you'd miss her . 
uh , it was , 
and i think it was like a three hour movie or two and a half hours , 
 and it was one of those ones that could have been four hours if they hadn't cut a lot out . 
 oh , really . 
 um , but it was really good . m , 
i would remember , i think in , with him in it . 
how about revenge , 
did you see that with him ? 
is that any good ? 
with , uh , anthony quinn . 
i like everything he's done so far . 
oh , okay . 
you know , it's , uh , one of those movies that it's not a great movie 
but it was okay . 
we were in the video store today 
and somebody was recommending it to somebody . 
you know the people who run the video store was recommending it to somebody else . 
it was not a bad movie . 
you sa , 
you said you seen no way out ? 
that was very good . 
um , he was in the untouchables , too . 
now that's another one i wanted to see . 
in fact , that was advertised not too long ago . 
it was on , um , 
cable ? 
i know i saw , yeah , something about it . 
when , you know , it was originally in the theaters 
and , um , you know , i saw part of it again . 
 i mean you know , i like costner , 
i like sean connery , 
and , uh , there's this one actor , 
it's really silly that i enjoy him a lot 
but i've really enjoyed him in everything i've seen him in , a guy named charles martin smith . 
i don't know him . 
um , you've probably seen him 
and just , an , 
you know , oh , that's who the guy is . 
do you remember , 
did you ever see american graffiti ? 
did you ever see the movie star man . 
in star man , he was the guy chasing after , um , jeff bridges and karen allen , or nancy allen . 
you know , w , 
short nerdy guy with glasses . 
he's just , 
i don't know why but he's always a lot of fun in every movie he's in . 
he was in the untouchables . 
he was the accountant .
oh , oh i know who you mean . 
he looks like rick moranis 
but he's not .
oh , okay , 
all right , 
that's the one i was thinking of . 
but i've seen quite a few movies , 
i enjoy them . 
i think that , uh , it's kind of like , uh , good entertainment .
how about some of the ads , 
do they influence you a lot . 
a review usually won't make me go see a movie i hadn't already wanted to see . 
did you see goodfellas ? 
it's o , uh , 
i want to see it . 
that was pretty good . 
um , and , 
um , we want to see godfather part three also 
but my girlfriend's seen part one and part two although she saw them years ago , 
 but i've never seen either of the godfather movies 
so , we're probably going to like rent those some time and then try to see godfather part three somewhere . 
i was just going to say , uh , first if you can . 
if you read the book it's , uh , even better . 
the book was excellent . 
oh , okay , 
i haven't ,
and , uh , i was a little disappointed in the third on , 
it's godfather three . 
it was not bad 
but , i expected more , i think . 
we just rented , um , a couple weeks ago , a movie called the freshman , 
with , um , 
it's got matthew broderick in it and , um , uh , marlon brando . 
and brando like does a parody of the character he played in the godfather . 
oh , really . 
um , yeah , 
um , but , uh , 
and , uh , in his classes they're running a bunch of scenes from the godfather 
and then he's running into marlon brando who is playing , you know , you know this , uh , organized crime head . 
so , it was a fun movie . 
or , uh , 
i liked rainman , 
i thought it was interesting that he was doing som , 
oh , yeah , 
that was good , 
i liked rainman , too . 
well i'm , 
being from baltimore , of course , i'm a big barry levinson fan since , uh , you know , he's done a bunch of baltimore movies . 
um , n , 
barry levinson did , um , diner and tinman , and avalon which are all set in baltimore . 
they sound familiar . 
i probably saw parts of those . 
you know , a lot of times i'll start watching a movie 
and i'm tired 
and it , 
next thing you know , it's 
especially if there's commercial in it .
 and then the titles might sound familiar 
but i really don't know what they're all about . 
of the three of those , diner's probably the best . 
i mean , they're all pretty good , 
but diner is really worth seeing . 
is that the one set in the fifties , or sixties . 
late fifties , 
i think i saw that one . 
and , uh , 
how about meryl streep , 
uh , i don't know , 
i'm not a real , uh , great football follower , 
i guess , there are two basic teams that i seem to follow every year . 
one is the dallas cowboys 
and the other is the oklahoma sooners . 
oh , okay . 
uh , being a native okie , uh , i like to keep up with what the homeboys are doing . uh . 
i see , 
so you make it , uh , to that longhorns sooners game ? 
every year . 
uh , i got out and got my bachelor's degree in uh , seventythree and , uh , never went to a game there and have never gone to a game since . 
how about that . 
but i always enjoyed watching them , 
i just 
growing up in oklahoma , there it was always the home team , kind of like dallas is around here . 
and there's always been an interest there . 
well , it's kind of same for me , 
i grew up in southern new jersey 
and the local team was philadelphia . 
and they were like thirty miles right up the river 
and i'm still pretty much an eagle fan , i guess . 
i guess you keep those things you grew up with . 
i worked in , uh , missouri for a while 
and , uh , i was probably the only one in the room several times when we were watching football on t v when the cowboys were playing the saint louis cardinals 
and i was rooting for the cowboys . 
but , they were kind of closer to home when i struck up with them . 
i really don't know what's going to take place with the cowboys this year . 
everybody keeps talking about the reconstruction they're going through and new players and how next year is going to be even bigger and better than the previous year . 
in a way that happened this past season , 
and i think that's quite a bit of optimism around here that still there's a chance that maybe , uh , these guys are right , maybe they will come through and do something this year . 
i look for it to be a pretty good year . 
boy uh , they sure did have a big turn around from a couple of years ago . 
they did , 
uh , they got rid of a lot of familiar names and got a lot of names in that we weren't familiar with . 
some of them turned out to be pretty good players , 
uh , some of them didn't 
and you know maybe the stuff that , uh , jerry jones is talking about the construction and redefining the team and maybe the effort might be starting to pay off . 
at least we hope it will . 
i keep waiting for the eagles to get over the hump . 
they make it to the playoffs it seems for the last few years 
but they just have done absolutely nothing when they got there .
and you know , they've got a lot of the tools to do it , 
but doggone if they can't just put it together , uh , you know , 
they have got the quarterback there in randal cunningham , who's just , you know , phenomenal , 
but , he's too streaky it seems . 
but they have always been a really strong team . 
and without a whole lot of big name players . 
they have got a few anchors on offense and defense 
and you know they've managed with those guys 
and i don't know . 
once the pressure gets turned on they seem to loose it . 
i guess , yeah . 
see that's the typical trait of the dallas cowboys .
it's funny , over the years . 
i guess since staubach left , they haven't been able to ,
i don't know why it's so hard to find , uh , a good quarterback these days . 
well , for his ability , though i think .
well , yeah . 
you know , he was one of the few who come through in history that can really perform , 
uh , we hope , 
every team hopes their current quarterback is going to pull them through . 
in a way aikman has done some of that . 
but , uh , the guy winds up getting hurt every other game . 
i tell you , it's difficult in that guy's position coming into that because there , he was just so highly touted by the press and everybody expected so many big things , you know . 
they did . 
they put a lot of pressure on him from the outside and from the inside . 
uh , it's funny watching them play , 
he's probably like a lot of quarterbacks , uh , 
when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best . 
and i haven't quite figured that out , 
if they figure they have got it won or if there's no real hurry because the first three quarters or , uh , uh , if something happens that that adrenalin starts flowing . they say , hey , we got to do something now . and then start playing the game the way the game should be played toward the last few minutes . 
so , i don't know 
i'm looking for a good year . 
i guess we're always looking for a good year . 
so , obviously though , do you think they're going to do anything in the playoffs to make it to the super bowl this year 
or who do you like to do that this year ? 
uh , no 
i think they will probably win one or two more games than they did this year , 
and they'll get close to it . 
they'll probably get everybody's hopes up and blow it toward the end . 
 so who's going to beat them ? 
who are they going to blow it to ? 
uh , that's a good question . 
uh , i'm figuring either the eagles or possibly san francisco 
i'm not real sure . 
boy , they'd some big changes , speaking of them . 
they did . 
so , i don't know how these changes are going to help or hinder the team , sometimes it brings in new motivation 
and all you can do is get out of the way because here they come . 
i'm sure , you know , my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia , 
but i sure am scared of them giants .
well , that's true . 
those guys are tough . 
they are tough 
and they're big , 
they're mean 
and they are going to come right through you if you don't do something . 
that sure was a fun super bowl to watch this year . 
oh , yeah , 
i mean , i wasn't pulling for either team . 
but that was just a good football game . 
and it's funny , 
you know . you like to pull for the underdog 
and for a long time i was pulling for denver . 
uh , marino makes me just crazy mad sometimes , because of some of the stupid stuff he does , 
but he's a good quarterback . 
he's got a good arm , 
sometimes it's too good because he throws too hard . 
l a you mean ? 
boy , speaking of denver , on another subject , i've been up there like five times in the last three , four weeks . 
oh , yeah ? 
we've been trying get this new d n b two thousand printer up and running . 
has it been , uh , snowing up there ? 
oh , boy i was just up there , 
i just got back last night around eleven thirty or so , 
and it snowed all day . 
well , that will make the skiers happy . 
oh , yeah , 
it snowed that much in denver you know 
they got that much up in the mountains , you know , just west of there . 
oh , you bet . 
oh , yeah , 
up around the keystone and copper mountain , those guys will love that . 
well , good to talk to you . 
enjoyed it bob . 
you guys have a good time , keep those printers coming . 
we'll do it . 
all right , 
go ahead . 
and my reasons are based upon not only what i see on the newspapers , but up against some of the , fun and exciting things i ran into during my six years as a soldier in the fifth special forces group . 
um . okay . 
i guess i don't see them as much of a threat as they used to be , 
but i think just the instability of the country right now is , sort of scary . 
 well , that's what makes it a powder keg . 
the , um , 
i'll go back in time a little bit , to about eightyone ,
um , naturally we were at the time , 
the soviet union was considered to be the big military power and the big threat . 
so we got quite a bit of information as well as indoctrination on soviet tactics and weapons . 
i went to lebanon in eightythree , before the marines ever got there , with the u n peace keeping force . with the training i received prior to going there , with captured weapons we kept running up against . 
these weren't chinese made copies . 
these were soviet made , top of the line , fresh out of the box , a k fortysevens .
um , uhhuh . 
in granada , in october , twentyfifth , eightythree , we invaded the place . 
sure there were cuban soldiers there , 
but there was also a bunch of russian advisors that were damn good shots . 
the team i was with , we jumped in on the western tip of the island down on point salinas . 
and for every cuban there was at least five russian advisors . 
and they were all shooting state of the art soviet weapons . 
in eightyfour , i was down in central america , as an advisor to the honduran army . 
again we were running up against cubans quite a bit , plus soviet advisors . 
and the equipment we were capturing and taking from the nicaraguans , was brand new , out of the crate , soviet made material . 
do i consider them a threat ? 
they have a university in moscow called the patrice de lamumba university . 
about like a and m or u t , where they're teachings subjects like that , they're teaching terrorism . 
some of the people we went up against in lebanon were graduates from that place . 
and let me tell you , they are nothing nice to go up against . 
i'm surprised during this iraqi crisis we didn't have more incidents than they did . 
these guys are top of the line . 
when they graduate from there , they can pull terrorist actions anywhere in the free world . 
and they are very , very good at what they do . 
so until i see the entire , quote , old guard of the soviet government completely roll over and disappear , preferably buried , i still consider them a threat . 
their military is different from ours , to where there are extremist generals that actually control tens and thousands of troops . 
irregardless of what soviet policy is , they're going to do what the general tells them . 
i guess that's what concerns me the most . is they're so unstable that somebody like that could make , uh , decisions that would jeopardize a lot of people . 
well , it's interesting watching the different soviet states , albania , lithuania , doing their little revolts down there . 
each one of those sectors has got a soviet general over the troops that are there . 
so far they haven't run into the real psychos yet . 
there's probably five or six , which would be an equivalent of our joint chiefs of staffs , that are in positions over some of these soviet states . 
if uprisings it's going to be a total blood bath . 
it looks like it's come close to that as it is . 
actually , they're showing remarkable restraint . 
they get real nasty , the  hyundee  helicopters come out 
and they , would level entire areas . 
you know , basically the size of , uh , the area around richardson ? 
you put five soviet  hyundee  helicopters in the air , they can level the entire area 
and there won't be anything left alive . 
and they can do that in about four minutes . 
and they've got entire squadrons of those just standing by . 
they used them in afghanistan , did remarkably well considering the terrain they were flying in . 
but on a highly populated area , like some of the soviet cities would be , with the weaponry that's attached on those things , there is no place to hide . 
if the bombs don't get you , if the bullets don't get you , then the nerve gas definitely will get you . 
the only drawback on that little piece of machinery is they only got five minutes of air time . 
they drink that much fuel . 
were you , 
have you , 
i take it you haven't spent any time in the military ? 
as a civilian that's never been attached to any form of the military , 
i know a lot of this stuff that i was involved in , never did make the newspapers . 
 but , during that same time frame , didn't you get some feeling , that , i mean , they're getting all these weapons and stuff ? 
didn't it bug you a little bit why they kept coming up with all this stuff ? 
you mean in the most recent conflict ? 
in any of them since eightyone . 
oh . yeah , 
i'm a little bit shocked to what the u s has done in terms of selling to iraq in the past ten to fifteen years . 
i think we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too . 
it's bad enough that the soviets do it . 
it all boils down to , whether it's our side , their side , 
it's a matter of money ,
the deal the iraqis have with the russians was for oil . 
it's scary to know that they're supplying that many people with weapons . especially when it's to the south of us . 
uh , the ones to the south are more regional conflict . 
they're not really that worried about invading north . 
they're more interested in , 
they've got a screwed up situation , i'll give them that . from mexico all the way down into central and south america . 
the situation down there is weird 
and it's very screwed up . 
inflation is out of this world 
and the governments , which our government has technically supported for years , are corrupt as all get out . 
and generally the people ,
and they're tired of it , 
and they're willing to try anything to get out from under it , even if that means going to communism . 
well , i think russia is getting to the point where they're about to do something to get out of communism . 
i guess i'd would like to see somebody like yeltsin to get more power . 
i think gorbachev has about had his day . 
unfortunately , yeltsin's got too many connections with the old guard . 
that's the only drawback that i see with the entire thing . 
gorbachev has made his attempt 
and he's had his problems with some of the old guard himself . 
yeltsin's in tight with the old guard . 
so it may be trying to choose between the lesser of two evils ,
i don't know , 
i sure wouldn't turn my back on them . 
you mean , 
i understand when uh , or they reduced the number of troops in europe after the berlin wall went down , 
i thought that was great . 
but by no means do i endorse or approve pulling everybody out . 
it may be a much reduced force than what we used to have over there . 
but you still better have the key players in place , if something does go down . even if it's a regional conflict . 
if united states is going to flex its muscle and be the super power that it is , not only does talk the talk , but it's got to be able to walk the walk . 
it's got to have the stuff to back up what it's saying . 
if you've only got a token force there , you can't hold your ground . 
at least they're learning a little bit from history . 
i mean , uh , 
um , well , what do you think is , uh , the main pollutants in the air ? 
i have trouble with the chemical plants and things like that uh , i think they put off so much 
and they're not regulated enough . 
 well   , that's me too . 
after , um , 
on channel thirteen , uh , they had some programs the day before , 
and i'm not sure that about yesterday , we didn't really watch it too much yesterday , 
but the day before they had a lot of programs about the environment and , you know , how we're affecting the earth and things by what we do ,
 and they mentioned sulfur and carbon dioxide a lot , 
and that actually , um , as our population increases and , you know , you know , our number of cars increase per the population , that's the problem . but also like you said the industry pollution 
and , you know , i mean , it's better than it used to be 
but it's incredible that they're not made to regulate the amount of pollutants that they put into the air . 
you know , i just , 
i can't  stand that  
and i know for a fact that they get away with a lot that , 
you know , they're supposed to be regulated because uh , a pillsbury plant , 
and i know people that work there that , 
of course , you wouldn't think pillsbury would put out certain chemicals , 
but they put out toxic chemicals there just in some of to ,
i mean , it's incredible . 
and , um , they said that you know , they have a little creek that runs by them 
and some of the people that work there have told me that when they have inspectors coming they , you know , shut down everything 
and they clean up their act , but on a normal basis that they're dumping things ,
and i'm like , if they're getting away with it ,
that's a pillsbury plant 
i can't imagine plants , 
i wouldn't have thought that pillsbury you know , well , 
those chemicals  would  not , 
they have chemicals that they use to refine their flours with and stuff ,
and then they also do testing there , 
and i don't , 
you know , when you consider , you know , it's probably not radioactive 
but toxic uh , classified that can damage the earth . 
so , there could be a lot of things that they could put , you know , that chemical wise that they use to , uh , that they are testing with ,
you know , like in , 
and , uh , you know , just goodness . 
i don't think they do the packaging at this plant , 
but they do a lot of research 
and do a lot of the refining up there 
i'm not really , 
what's it called when you do flour , 
i'm not , 
uh , only thing i can think is bleaching 
but , i mean , i , 
but , um , we're on the southwest side of houston 
we don't have that much as far as , uh ,  aiming in  the plants over on this , uh , the east side does . 
we've got imperial sugar 
you know , they're right there on the creek also 
and , uh , they've been there for years . 
and , uh , 
i mean , you think about it , you know , 
it's probably a lot easier to detect things that go into the ground than it is maybe to just , 
i'm not really sure 
but i would think it would be easier to detect those things because you could detect them down or stream or such , 
or you can , you know , do , uh , testing on the ground itself at that point , 
but when they pollute into the air you know , and you've got movement through the air , it's going to move a lot of that off . 
so , i don't see , you know , how they can do some of the te , 
unless it just hangs there like in places where it's a lot of pollution , you know , like in los angeles it tends to get stuck there , 
you know , that you have a lot more particles in the air ,
but , um , 
i know that , 
i worry every now and then , 
we're still on a well water , 
we're not on city water , 
and i think , well , what if somebody's dumped something back there in the , and no one knows about it and , you know , it sinked in through the ground and all that , 
well , i know out in some , 
i'm not sure , 
i can't remember the name of the county 
it's where stillwater is or ,
i'm not sure , 
i know it , 
i think it's , uh , 
i know we have a piece property there , 
it's called dublin , 
it's in dublin , texas . 
i'm not really sure what the county , 
it's stephen , 
oh , okay , 
where stephenville's at ,
so , they have a lot of cattle in the area , 
i mean , uh , per lot , 
you know , they've got like a lot of head of cattle because dairies they don't th , 
it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free , 
they've got to have them there to be able to milk them . 
and they , 
and i read in this article , i couldn't believe it , where , you know , like , one cow like , a day , produces like a hundred or so pounds of manure . 
one cow , 
i was like , my god , 
and they , 
and this thing says people think , well , cow manure is good for fertilizer 
but when you get that much manure it says it becomes a real problem because it's not 
when , you know , you buy cow manure at the store they've added stuff to it 
and they've added humus and stuff that ,
and , uh , bacteria in the manure that is , 
what it's doing is it's going through , uh , 
they don't have a very deep , um , o , 
you know , their water , 
i forget what that's called with , you know , 
it's like a spring water , 
but it's below the surface 
it's not very far down , 
and all this stuff is seeping through to the water , 
and they're water in that town will be totally polluted , 
it will . 
and they won't be able to have any drinking water because they will have , um , you know , there's too many toxins and bacterial growth , 
and the gr , 
and i'm like my god , you know , 
and the ground will filter some of it but not all of it . 
not when you figure , 
i didn't realize one cow produces that much manure 
and they were talking like , 
these are  well fed  .
these are , 
good grief , these are well fed cows , uh ,  , 
well , they are evidently . 
but , um , i mean , evidently a normal cow produces that much too , 
but they're just so spread out on ranches and stuff that it's not , you know , a problem , 
but when they get them in these tiny little areas , you know , they've got a real big problem , 
and that what they were doing was scraping it with bulldozers and stuff , and taking it to ,
but the ponds because they've had so much rain in the past few years , they just ,
and they overflow into the creeks and stuff in the area . 
so , that just creates , 
you know , there's , 
and , oh , it was just disgusting 
it said the creeks will foam . 
watch the creeks foam brown and all , 
oh , now that's bad . 
and i'm just like , oh , my gosh , 
and the smell is really bad they sa , 
oh ,  , i was going to say , the air pollution alone there just from a hundred pounds of cow manure was going to be bad . 
but i don't know 
it really frightens me though as far as you know , thinking of just air pollution itself 
and , channel thirteen they're really , um , emphasizing the problem with acid rain , you know , 
you know , what the earth is receiving back , you know , 
and then cutting the trees , you know , that bothers me . 
as far as , you know the 
the rain forest and all . 
uh , we've been wanting to , 
well , not me 
but , uh , it's been or suggested that we cut a few of the trees down here , 
i'm like , no , 
you know ,   for what's cut down here , you know , more will be cut down someplace else 
and it will just take that longer to grow back , 
and trees help so that , uh , 
 , i don't , 
well , they do because , what is it , carbon dioxide ,
and they're synthesizing it for us . 
 believe me  it's just so much better . 
so , uh , yeah , 
i knew , 
i think there's lots to improve how things are done now . 
i think we just have to , 
i don't know personally , you know , 
i suppose , you know , if you just make sure your car is , 
and yo , 
you know , they're suppos , 
nowadays they have the emission controls on them 
but , uh , i think your legislator's back , you know , as far as , 
seems like they've only just really started as far as the environment saying ,
it's really becoming a problem . 
by the year two thousand there will , 
what are we going to have , 
what kind of results are we going to have for the environment . 
and what will we  . . . 
i don't know how much i know about this subject .
well , i don't know if i know anything or not , 
but i've got some opinions on it . 
go ahead . 
see those type of people that have the most opinions , ones that don't know anything .
well , uh , i've had teenagers 
and i now have grandchildren that are teenagers , 
and i don't know that it might do them a little bit of good to see the world from a different perspective . 
uh , i think this "me" generation has gone far too far . 
and the young people are overly impressed . 
and i think it wouldn't hurt them to step back from themselves just slightly and see things from a far more disadvantaged viewpoint . 
that's true . 
uh , i personally know nothing about the peace corps though . 
um , me either . 
i went to college and then started working and then got married 
but they have , 
i read somewhere , 
and i'm out on a limb here , some type of college , uh , volunteer work for teachers , that they are straight out of college 
and they do one year of volunteer work teaching in the , uh , lower income brackets of the united states . 
have you ever heard about that one ? 
i know that , uh , my sister , 
i have a twin sister 
and when they graduated she went to , uh , teach in a small town down in south texas 
and i know , that like if you have college notes , if you teach in a lower income bracket where they don't pay as much and they cancel part of your , you know , your college note or whatever . 
oh , really ? 
if it's like , you know , really you know , to live . 
and this is money that she's borrowed to form her college education ? 
but i , 
but she got credits for it ? 
that's very interesting . 
and , um , i think it would be , 
i know that also one of my cousins who , uh , he is in like the therapy type  thing  
and he was , um , 
some group paid part of his college income 
but then he was required to go back and work for a certain number of years in this town at , uh , uh , 
i mean , it's a nursing home or something like that . 
so , you know , if , 
i think that's a good way you know , maybe get people to come back to these small towns to work by helping people that normally might not be able to go to college and get the type of degree they want . 
i think that is an excellent program , 
i really do . 
i like that . 
and it's beneficial to the small towns too because ,
as far as yeah , getting doctors and all that stuff , yeah . 
you know , if we had some really major health problem that required a specialist , we could find one it wouldn't be convenient , 
but we could find one . 
we wouldn't have to drive and spend the night someplace or something like that . 
so , i can see the advantage to that one . 
i really don't know that much about it , 
you know , i think of the peace corps , you know , more like the sixties and that kind of stuff when , 
it's still in existence . 
and don't they go into other countries and stuff ? 
things that make the , 
make them more selfsupporting ? 
it's not a program to teach them to use the american money , it's a program to teach them to be more selfreliant . 
you're right , 
i think it's a sixties program . 
i think it was one of kennedy's hot points that he , 
that was his big deal . 
but it definitely would give a lot of the kids now that have everything given to them that they want to see what it's like if you don't have all the money and can't have what you want when you want it . 
um ,  , i think i've singled out my grandchildren 
they're pretty good ,
but at the same time i think it would do them a world of good . 
but there's a , 
i don't know that you could require everyone to ,
mandatory just like , 
i don't know that that would work if ,
every time you , 
they could buy their way out . 
i mean , there would be loopholes just like there is in anything else .
you know , they'd figure a way around that one in a heartbeat . 
but ,  , i'm wondering if there's another issue here , 
and maybe this is why this has died out . 
can you go into , 
but it may be the more of the issue versus should young adults , 
can they go in there and can anyone go well , out of 
the  kurdish  community is a little bit extreme at this time , 
but say , i think bangladesh would have been a good example or some really desperate situation 
and teach them to farm and teach them 
and it doesn't do any good . 
i don't know that it does . 
you know , we're losing certain ,
there are people now that are obsolete point and fact just like endangered species of animals , so there are  quote  tribes of people ,
and i'm just wondering if you're fighting a natural process there of being  winnowed  out . 
there's a german word for it that's elegant , 
but i never can remember what it was , 
uh , where they are they're not adapted to their environment essentially . 
um , and one of the quick examples is the aborigines . 
uh , when we were in australia ,  , uh , 
sad little things . uh , i felt sorry for them . because their society isn't there anymore , 
and their  belief  system and all the structures of their society are gone , essentially . 
and they're just kind of more like a side show than anything else 
and that's sad . 
but i don't think there's any way uh , the peace corps could go in and rescue those people , 
and i don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either . 
so , i'm wondering if the peace corps is ,
down here with the peace corps we're talking about all these people that aren't even in our own country when there's enough people here that i think probably need help and ,
good point . 
we've got enough without a passport 
there's plenty . 
i think we ought to worry about our own species . 
and maybe rather than just , require somebody to join like the peace corps for a year maybe like , um , during college , you know , maybe have some kind of course where they'd be required to do some kind of community service type work , and help people in that area or people in the united states . 
i wonder now in , 
and i've been out of school too long to answer this , 
but i wonder if there aren't some sociology courses . 
there probably are , you know , 
but i'm sure , 
that's probably like people that do that are the people that are going to go into social work and stuff 
but i think that it wouldn't really be half bad for everybody not to do something , you know , and realize it's everybody's responsibility to , um , help these people , you know , 
and no , 
i'm not saying just give them money 
but , i mean , because they have to be taught to be , 
that's the last thing you want ,
i mean , i know that's what my fatherinlaw was talking about , you know , when you give these people money 
or ,  , what was it 
they were bringing up points asking as far as whether they need to give , um , more money to these people , 
i mean , and that's not really the answer ,  i mean   , because if they're alcoholics they'll just go out and spend ,
that's exactly it . 
they're not going to take that money you give them and go try to figure out a way to dry out with it . 
now come on , let's be realistic , 
that's just not realistic . 
or , you know , to find a job where they can learn how to support themselves , 
i mean , i guess we're getting kind of off the subject ,  , here , 
we're not i don't think . 
i think ,
i mean it's , 
i think that's a lot more realistic . 
uh , i think that we should be spending more time 
it doesn't fit the circumstance anymore . 
uh , we've got plenty , 
in fact , we've got far too many . 
you're in , uh , what flower mound ? 
so , we're a little you know , farther removed from like dallas and some of the areas where they probably have more of the homeless and that type of thing . 
i was , 
that's exactly what i was going to ask you . 
have you been downtown recent , 
what kind of recycling programs do you have in rowlett ? 
um , th , 
well right now they've got a , kind of a central location off of the main highway , 
and they've got some great big bins there for newspaper , um , plastic , um , i think three bins for glass , white , green , and whatever other combination there is . 
 uh , some kind of container for aluminum . 
plano's doing real good on that . 
uh , they start off putting out great big huge garbage cans .
and of course it doesn't fit right now . 
but now we start in may , breaking it down , 
and they're picking it all up . 
so they're going to by , 
and we have to separate our papers , and our glass , 
and then , uh , they have one day for , like , um , oh , everything you picked up from your yard , 
 and we put that in disposable bags , 
and they pick that up on monday . 
so it's really great . 
you know , completely for it , 
i think it's marvelous . 
well , that's good . 
well , rowlett had a pick up , i guess , on the days they do trash or something like that . 
and apparently a lot of people responded to it favorably , because they're going to do it . 
i don't know how soon they're going to do it , or how organized it's going to be , 
but sometime in the next couple of months . 
well , does your , uh , 
where you work , do they also have aluminum cans pickups and things like that ? 
um , i've never noticed that . 
we don't have a whole lot , because we're in a hospital setting , 
so most of the things we have are through our cafeteria . um , 
well , down in the cafeteria do they have any place where you can put your , you know , pop cans , and things like that ? 
um , no . 
and it's not accessible to the cafeteria now , 
so , uh , mainly what they serve in there is juice and coffee and tea . 
 so you don't have much choice there . 
not really . 
well i work at , uh , j c penny 
and last week they brought , 
they have a sign up that says for one full week 
and they're going to recycle them . 
so it's getting people clean out their closets and such . 
and then like , the week before that , they said go through your cupboards and any food that is still good , bring it in 
and they brought it down to the shelters . 
and , they have , one , two , they have three , i think , that i know of 
and they put them right near where they have the time cards . 
and it works great . 
and they have one in the room where the snack machines are too . 
that's good . 
so they're really going at it , 
and i think it's marvelous because , 
i guess rowlett's done a lot for the size town it is . 
and i think they're trying to make some changes . 
to cut your lawn without a bag . just to kind of mulch it ,
and it's , uh , i guess a lot more ecological to just mow the grass and let it work its way back into the soil . 
well , did you watch the program the other night on , um , was it save america ? 
it was good . 
the only thing i thought , um , that i haven't been trying , is when i , you know , go to take a shower , to save the water ,
but i've already gone to , 
oh i started years ago , i guess , not years ago , 
but , yeah 
i would say five years ago , turning off i mean my water faucet ,
but i didn't realize that was the biggest waste of water . 
that was surprising to me . 
i missed that question , totally , i mean really bad . 
i'm trying to think , 
i didn't miss too many , 
i can't remember what my score was , 
but i did exceeding well . 
i was surprised . 
but i didn't realize that our garbage isn't being decomposed . 
that was a shocker to me . 
well there are a lot of things that aren't , 
 i'm   , 
that's , uh , one of the things i wonder about , 
why they couldn't do more recycling with those . 
well , i was in , uh , bizmart the other day , 
and , what i don't understand is there is recycled paper in there , 
and it cost more than regular paper . 
and it was only , i think , uh , forty cents more , you know , fifty cents more , 
but people aren't buying it , 
so the cost of it is higher . 
i noticed that about things like 
and lawn additives and that type of thing , 
but the cost is like , double or sometimes triple ,
so , in , in terms of that , 
you know , and , for the environment there's a good reason to do it , 
but the cost is kind of prohibitive . 
now , see that's recycling , you know , 
companies that do at least go into it , 
i'd like to see subsidy by the government or something , or taxwise or something , heavily enough to where they could get their prices lower than regular . 
so that people would use this stuff over again . 
it's a good idea . 
it's like when he was saying , uh , which one was recyclable , which was reusable , 
and the recycle ones are better to use , 
 but lots of times you don't even see the signs on the bottles . 
and if we're going to really do something , they ought to put that stuff out bigger for people to see it . 
i had to put my bifocals on to see it .
that's hard when you're in a grocery store and you're short anyway . 
you have to get enough nerve to ask somebody to take something off the top shelf . 
it's not recyclable . 
i'd heard something stranger , 
talk about bottles the other day on the radio station , i think it's k l t y . they were talking about the , 
i think it's in canada they're using , oh , recyclable milk jugs , plastic milk jugs ,
oh , really ? 
and apparently they don't break down very easily , 
and this is kind of an unusual use for that type of thing . 
you know they're , 
along that same line , they said they were using , um , 
what is , oh , i know , 
it was toilets . you know , the old ones ? 
and i thought , well , that's good . 
and then i saw recycling on tires between , uh , 
well , hoses were being used ,
what else , 
something else was made out of old tires , 
i was trying to remember what it was . oh , i can't think of it now . 
but i was trying to get my , uh , kids , you know , to see different things that we could come up with for recycling purposes . 
and just anything , to , you know , recycle rather than keep throwing it away , 
but my biggest problem is , i take the bags out of the store , buy the bags to bring the back , 
and then i forget to bring them in the store . 
i'm forever going back out to my car to pick up my bags to bring them and take my garbage back out . 
i wish they'd really push this recycling bit , because i really didn't realize how much stuff i actually throw away . 
well , i think the more they'll do . 
i think that's just the biggest problem is keeping it in front of the public so they understand how serious the problem is , and how important it is to do that . 
you know what i'd like to see a little more . 
i don't have any little tiny kids , 
but if they get the little tiny kids saving it now ,
because it's , 
we've all got to do it right now . 
i just , 
i really amazed to find out that , in garbage fills . 
in five years we're supposed to be at max . 
i don't think i can keep my own garbage . 
i mean , i might not have that much , 
but i wouldn't , 
i started when i was in college . 
you know , they always offer credit cards for college students . 
so i went ahead , and accepted every one that i was offered .
so , i pack around a lot of them , 
but i only use a few of them . 
you have a lot of discipline . 
they make it really easy for people uh , to get credit cards , especially college students . 
i have , uh , two daughters who both are in college 
or , in fact , one has finished now . 
but they both have a lot of credit cards . 
and they give you such high credit limits . 
it's easy to get caught up in the minimum payment trap . 
uh , right . 
and then they give you , uh , uh , the credit limit , 
and then you're always seemingly up to that limit . 
now i have quite a few credit cards that i'm always almost up to the limit on most of them . 
and that's how a lot of people get into trouble . 
you know , that usually i'll have a balance on . 
and then all of the others i just try to use kind of like you would an american express card and pay it off every month . 
and that way i feel like i'm getting , you know , a thirty day loan . 
but i don't have to worry about , you know , running them up too high , except at christmas . 
then they usually get run up pretty good . 
well , you have a lot of discipline . 
uh , i'm trying my best right now to pay off some of mine . 
i've paid off about four credit cards this year . 
are up to the limit . 
and especially the visa card 
and it seems like every time i'm short of cash , i just go get it from visa . 
now that's 
i've never used my visa for cash before . 
can you use it like at a bank machine 
well , uh , you can go in a bank and just hand them the visa card and say , "i want a cash advance ." 
or if they've sent you a personal identification number 
 oh , okay . 
because i have one that i don't have a pin number for . 
you know , sometimes you have to ask them for that . 
and then i have one that , uh , just gave me the pin number automatically . 
now we got , 
uh , my husband and i got credit cards in the mail one day that we hadn't even applied for . 
now a couple of weeks later we got pin numbers , 
and then we got , uh , a bill saying , you know , uh , the yearly fee , it was like forty dollars . 
and we hadn't even applied for them , 
and we didn't want them . 
but they had just automatically approved us and sent them without even contacting us . 
oh , wow! .
so i thought , man , i don't know if i trust this or not .
 well , they do that a lot if you have good credit and you have been paying your bills on time . 
a credit card . 
but it's hard , 
and sometimes i'll do that , 
but usually i , i will try to pay everything off the next month 
just i feel like even that little bit helps . 
well , you know , the way the economy's going and inflation and the recession and all that , i think we really need to try to stay out of debt as much as possible . 
to pay off mine and get out of debt . because we never know when we might , you know , get laid off or 
i know it . 
especially me . 
i work for texas instruments , 
and they've of , uh , you know , layoffs lately . 
well , i work for t i too . 
you do ? 
and i think they're getting ready to probably sell us out , our division . 
where are you ? 
in johnson city , tennessee . 
johnson city , 
they just announced that , didn't they ? 
so , i mean , it's kind of a bad time to be a slave to your credit cards . 
it certainly is . 
part time job , uh , where i was a collector .
people , uh , that 
they just had this jewelry account . 
it was zales jewelry , in fact . 
and , uh , a whole bunch of peop , 
i mean they have about a thousand collectors , i guess . 
and , uh , there's just so many people that have bought jewelry , which is really a luxury item 
 and then they just can't pay for it . 
something happens , 
you know , and you hear so many stories listening to them . like , uh , you know , they lost their job 
or , uh , they've signed for a friend . 
you know , they got it in their name 
but they 
and then the friend 
didn't pay them . 
and now they're stuck with the bill , 
and it's ruining their credit 
that's scary . 
because most of them do . 
i didn't realize that . 
and if you're , uh , 
 you know , your bill is due on the fifteenth 
oh , okay . 
but , you know , if you pay one day after that fifteenth , you're not one day late , 
you're thirty days late . 
that's scary . 
a , a , 
and , anyway , we need to watch our credit reports and all that kind of , 
that's something i never thought about getting , you know , checking with to see what your credit report looked like . 
well , you know , you can do that . 
i believe it costs about ten dollars . 
might be worth it for peace of mind . 
oh , yeah . 
it is , 
you might even find somebody's been reporting on you 
and you didn't even know it . 
you know , i mean you might think you're paying something on time 
and you , by that day 
and you're thirty days is not real bad though anyway . 
that's when it really gets bad . 
or something you haven't paid in sixty days or ninety days , you know . and things like that .
i think that discover card has a good idea with , you know , giving you a little cash back incentive for each amount you purchase . as long as you don't go crazy trying to get cash back . 
and since they don't have the yearly fee . 
do they charge a lot of interest on that card ? 
i don't know . 
i don't , 
i haven't gotten one .
i felt like with visa and mastercard and american express you didn't need another one . 
i would think it wouldn't be , you know , much more than the eighteen or nineteen percent everyone else charges . 
so that wouldn't be too bad . 
 well , always watch out for anybody who bills you out of atlanta , georgia . 
or there's a couple of other places that are able to charge us like twentyone and twentytwo percent interest . 
i know , i had a charge with , uh , spiegel , 
 and i hadn't read the , uh , terms of the credit agreement really . 
and , uh , when i did , seemed like i was never paying the balance off ,
and i looked at the credit card agreement one day , 
and it was like twentythree percent interest . 
holy cow! 
 and that's the one bill that i hurried and paid up . 
that's awful . 
you really have to watch those interest rates . 
i mean , 
i mean there's no point in giving them any more money than we have to . 
that's true . 
so anyway , they can't bill you any higher than eighteen percent , i think , in texas . 
oh , that's great . 
and one to watch out for is anybody that bills you out of atlanta , georgia . 
well , let's see . 
i was trying to think if there was anything else .
 uh , an item on my bill that i had never purchased . 
i had ordered a sofa and had filled out the paperwork , 
but they weren't supposed to process it until they delivered it . 
and i changed my mind , 
 but then they went ahead and charged it on my account . 
and it took me about eighteen months to get all of that mess off of my account . 
so that's probably the worst thing i've ever had happen with a credit card . 
i wonder if they  . . . 
hi norma . 
have you taken anything back lately , uh , that you've bought ? 
well the only thing we've taken back recently are plants .
 well why ? 
and we had no problem with it . 
very good . 
we got our money back . 
well , i believe they're better . 
i do too . 
i believe about ten years ago that we went through a terrible time , 
but i don't , 
i believe that they're better now , 
you know , wh , 
i think so . 
i don't think they're shoddy , not as shoddy . 
electrical appliances i think are pretty good , reliable . 
however , i didn't like it very well when the transmission went out on my car with sixtythree thousand miles on it . 
 and i don't like it very well if , when my electric blanket that was only one year old went out uh , on one side . 
oh , did you return it ? 
no , 
i had taken the first one back . 
i didn't think that it heated well enough . 
it never did get anything but just moderately warm , 
took it back 
and , uh , the people told me well that's the way it's supposed to be 
and i fell for it 
and , uh , when i got this one it heated a little bit warmer 
and then after one year it started heating only on one side . 
so either you or your husband can be warm but not both .
 also , i took an iron back after having it only one year . 
now i figure uh , anybody that is dumb enough to iron , needs to have an iron that will last a long time , 
and one year of ironing only once a week is not long enough for it to last . 
did they replace it ? 
well without even any question , 
but i think it was the store . 
walmart , 
i was going to say , it must have been walmart . 
and , uh , well , have you been buying any clothes lately ? any new clothes ? 
well the last thing i bought was a dress last summer . 
and the buttons turned on it over the winter . 
the buttons tarnished slightly 
and i have not gone back about it . 
that was poor quality , i think . 
i think it is too , 
and it was an expensive dress . 
i wondered if it weren't expensive , 
it was . 
 and they should have put buttons on it that would last forever . 
that's right , 
that's what i think too . 
and one chain belt loop 
and that was , i believe a leslie faye dress 
and it was , i think , over a hundred dollars . 
you spent that much on your dresses ? 
but i did that one . 
you're really divulging very personal information . 
 but i think it should have been better than that , for that money , is what i mean . 
oh , of course , i do too . 
i think so . 
and norma , it is just wonderful to talk to you . 
good talking to you too , 
i've enjoyed it .
you are a good one to talk about consumer goods , because you keep up on it all the time . 
 well , we'll be talking to you later . 
bye , bye . 
and , uh , what part of virginia , uh ? 
uh , i live down in the south western part of blacksburg . 
blacksburg . 
i've been , 
have you ever heard of virginia tech ? 
v p i . 
i hadn't been down in that part of the state really . 
well , we vacation a lot . 
how about you ? .
quite frequently . 
uh , i wish we did .
 well , we retired early 
oh , okay . 
 so , we take trips pretty often . 
where all you guys go ? 
well , we go to maine every fall 
then that's kind of a family visit and a vacation all up and down the coast 
 and i have a daughter in texas and one in new mexico , 
so we go out there 
and we go to florida 
 and down , oh , 
we were just out recently at the outer banks of north carolina . 
all these places that i've never been .
is that right .
where do you go ? 
what type of vacation ? 
 well , it really depends , 
i mean , uh , seems like i do a lot in the midwest lately , 
uh , my , uh , fiancee's family's from wisconsin 
 and so we've been out there a couple of times 
and , uh , i , uh , went to purdue for a couple of years , 
so i've gone up to indianapolis on occasion to visit friends 
 and , uh , uh , i'm a real big baseball fan 
so i usually try to combine it with , uh , catching a couple of games somewhere . 
what club do you follow ? 
uh , i'm a big red sox fan , 
red s , 
 but , uh , i , uh , 
me too .
uh , you're a red sox fan too ? 
i usually try to catch whoever's in town though , i don't specifically , 
i , you know , go to cleveland to see them play ,
uh , uh , that's about it , 
i mean , we do a lot of little trips around here , uh , 
and , uh , 
ever go up in pennsylvania in the mountains 
we've gone out to , um , uh , a place in western pennsylvania called falling water . 
uh , have you ever heard of it ? 
i've never been there . 
it's really neat . 
it's this house built on a waterfall 
and it's , uh , really cool .
um , of course , we keep picking crummy weather to go out there , 
 uh , the first time we went out there was , uh , the day after hurricane hugo had come through .
so , i mean they didn't have any power 
and it was really cold and rainy 
and , uh , we went up about a year later 
and it was better but not a whole ,
so , uh , where else did we go , uh , 
we've gone to richland , last year 
oh , did you ? 
did you go , 
have you been down there ? 
uh , my girlfriend has with her sisters 
but i haven't been ,
uh , i hear that's nice . 
we're going to get down , probably down norfork sometime this summer ,
we were down , 
well , when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork and spent the night there with a friend in portsmith and then went to williamsburg and spent a night . 
uh , spend a day and a lot of money .
i've heard , uh , 
i'm not real interested in williamsburg because of the price attached ,
we just , 
but it's pretty neat down to just go and walk around , if you like to walk , 
it's a good town to just ,
uh , yeah , 
you can go , 
oh , okay , 
so i can wander around without , 
it's a good town to wander in . 
oh , okay , 
i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings ? 
that's right . 
oh , okay , 
i didn't know that . 
i think , uh , they do the whole with , you know , paying , 
they really did throw away a lot of money getting one thing or another , 
 but they had a good time 
we really didn't do that really this time , we just , uh , visited around . 
uh , uh , 
we've done it a couple of times 
and that's enough for , uh , probably another twenty years . 
i was , uh , 
we use it live in california 
and , uh , my , um , 
up around san francisco , 
and , uh , there was one year when uh , my father's company was starting to do stuff down in los angeles , 
so , my father was working down in los angeles for like , uh , six months or so , 
uh , actually it was closer , i think to a full year 
and , you know , he'd fly down there on mondays and fly back on fridays , 
well , any time we had a school vacation or something like that we went down to los angeles , 
so i went to disneyland about five times ,
and i really have no great urge to go back now . 
but the kids in los angeles didn't 
 so we basically had one of the parks . 
uh , i mean there's still a lot of people at disneyland , 
but there was um , another amusement park down there , busch gradens , uh , 
there was nobody there when we were there , we won a log floating ride like five straight times , 
we just get done with them and they go , oh , do you want to go again , 
have you ever , 
you've never been down to epcot at florida and disney 
 that's good , 
we really enjoy that , 
we've been two or three times and probably go back again this winter . 
i've never been , 
the fartherest south i've been on the east coast is charlotte . 
so , i , um , keep wanting to get further , 
you know , i thought i would go to florida a couple summers ,
but never did it . 
charleston is a really nice place to visit . 
uh , my sister lives in charlotte 
and they've gone to ,
it's a real pretty place . 
uh , yeah , 
one of these days we'll get down there , although .
uh , we're getting married in about ,
 oh , are you . 
it's up by green bay . 
it's a place my girlfriend's also wanted ,
and , uh , 
is it on , uh , one of the lakes ? 
it's , um , uh , 
i don't if you've ever seen a map of wisconsin 
but there's kind of like a little thing sticking out , uh , in the lake michigan , 
that's door county .
oh , okay , 
that would ,
they call it the cape cod of the , uh , 
so , uh , we're thinking that'll be a lot of fun , 
 uh , she had this , uh , book of pictures from it that were really nice , kind of like a travel guide 
sounds good . 
 so , uh , that should be a lot of fun . 
well , i don't know what our next trip will be , i guess our next , 
well , i know what my next trip , i'm going to be a grandmother in july .
the first one , 
 oh , boy . 
 so my next trip is going to be to texas .
oh , that'll be fun .
in the middle of the summer . 
well , yeah , 
you won't even ,
well , they'll be airconditioning anyway 
my daughter's a temp at texas instruments ,
 oh , okay . 
i was just , 
i mean most of the people i've talk to are from texas , 
that's it , 
i never asked him the other day how he was connected , 
i don't think he was t i employee . 
uh , i , uh , 
 oh , i see . 
so , uh , it was fun 
is that right . 
 well , we spent last week end in charlotte with real good friends that had just ,
 and , uh , we got back monday 
uh , that's neat . 
uh , you're sure have a nice town , 
uh , my , uh , sister lives on lake ,
 oh , does , 
that's nice out there . 
uh , we keep wanting to get down there and visit them over the summer 
and it's ,
it's real pretty . 
 traffic   , not much else we do for vacation really , 
uh , just so we haven't been able to take really . 
are you a golfer ? 
me either . 
no . 
are you guys ,
or , uh , 
except our outside    , though . 
just walking that's all .
 oh , i don't think there are any ,  traveling that was in my early teens down  in that area 
and i'm know real sure there are , um , 
no professionals .
when , uh , 
i was thinking i might be minor league 
oh , there's one in salem , salem rebels . 
salem rebels , 
buccaneers . 
oh , okay . 
i may be seeing them , um , in a town just west of here , frederick uh , has a minor league team that plays in the same league with salem 
and , uh , i think we may be seeing them this ,
is that right up there in frederick ? 
uh , that's a nice little town actually , frederick , uh , 
i've never been up there . 
i've never visited baltimore . 
i'd like to go just sight see a little bit sometime . 
oh , there's some nice things in baltimore , you know , 
the inner harbor and the , uh , 
uh , they've just done a , uh , 
you known , i , 
you know , the aquarium is one of those things that , you know , because everybody , 
do you have either one ? 
but i do gardening ,
  do you  .
oh , really ? 
um , i , 
we have enough property that we can have a little bit of a garden 
and that's fun , 
well , actually wally's had one even when we haven't had big yard because , um , we enjoy that . 
we love fresh vegetables in the summer , 
and it's just one of the things i enjoy doing . 
so do i . 
i would , 
i had rather be outside than inside any day . 
so would i .
 do you work during the week , uh , outside the home ? 
uh , so i manage to fit in my gardening chores afterward , 
i work for a school system 
so i'm able to do that , um , because i get home a little earlier , 
 and i can still do some sorts of things 
or you sneak out in the morning after daylight savings time starts and with your cup of coffee and see if it has grown overnight . 
oh , absolutely .
 well , i unfortunately am not gardening this year . 
i love gardening , 
in fact , i was prevented no , about thirty years ago with a life membership , uh , from the richmond , virginia counsel of garden clubs . 
and it wasn't because i was so good , 
but i organized a very large garden club , 
but i still have , uh , 
oh , that's wonderful . 
well , it's always something that seems so odd to me 
but , uh , 
 but that's , 
and you really feel you can accomplish something 
and to help other people too , that's neat . 
it has really nothing to do with , uh , actual gardening or flower arranging or anything like that , 
it was just that i happened to organize this group ,
that's wonderful . 
those numbers were great 
but it , 
well , i think it sounds good . 
i've never belonged to a garden club because i've always been more interested in just doing what i can do on my own , 
i've never had ,
but i know people who do it and enjoy it very much . 
well , and actually , i think that most women's garden clubs that i've been aware of in the past , uh , are only flowers , 
what i would like , 
we've spent the last twenty years in oklahoma . 
just moved to north carolina , 
 and , uh , we were originally , of course , from this area , from virginia , 
but , uh , in north , uh , 
in oklahoma , it's the men's garden clubs that i would have wanted to join . 
my word . 
and you would have because they do all kinds of , uh , gardening and not just flowers like women do . 
for heaven's sake . 
well , um , there aren't men's gardening clubs in this area that i know of , 
they're women . 
um , and usually they're the tea type things , you know , where they have a little luncheon 
and they do their thing . 
but , um , flowers are primarily the emphasis ,
i think so too . 
but i really like to do the vegetables . 
ten years being a florist . 
being what ? 
being a florist . 
oh , my . 
well , what a wonderful thing . 
 it was nice , 
it was exhilarating , uh , for many years . 
uh , many of those  tanned  until the last couple when , uh , we had such an economic slowdown . 
oh , terrible 
well , tell me what's in your garden this year , since i don't have one . 
well , uh , the flowers i'm just , 
in fact , i was going to go out today to buy some plants so i could put them in , 
i always have geraniums 
so i've discovered that , uh , impatiens that tried and true turns out to be about the best thing to use there along with coleus .
but i like the vinca which is something i hadn't , 
they look sort of like impatiens , 
you know , but they're not quite 
and they're better for the sun areas . 
um , and , of course , you know , and that sort of thing . 
in my , 
do you have trouble with red spider on marigolds ? 
maybe it's , 
i don't know , 
maybe this climate is a little better . 
um , but in the vegetable garden we grow , um , usually , what 
our favorite is something called  white half runner green beans   , 
now that's , 
do you , 
isn't that funny , 
so is my favorite . 
well , you know why , because i grew up in north carolina , 
 and that was my mother's , um , favorite bean 
she always grows , you know , five different varieties , 
 but that's the kind that produces the best . 
well , i think it has the best flavor . 
and they're wonderful , 
and i pick them when they're very young and have very little string and then just steam them a little bit , 
my mother picks them when they're fat 
and she cooks them for an hour with some  fat backs   ,  , 
well , i like them in between . 
 and they're good both ways . 
i like them in between . 
the flavor is better i think in between . 
oh , in between the 
 size wise  
my mother , 
well , my mother doesn't think they have any flavor the way i cook them .
well , and i know i love them , 
well , that's the yankee way . 
but i think ,
 oh , of course . 
i love them that way just the thrill of , 
it is . 
they're two different vegetables that way , 
in fact , my mother , who is eightysix years old , canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year . 
oh , my gosh . 
my ninety this year 
and she lives in western north carolina 
and , uh , she would do that if we didn't tell her that she'd better not .
but she doesn't have that big a garden , 
but she has a bigger one than i do . 
and i have four children , you know , 
and she tends to it herself ? 
oh , yes , 
isn't that wonderful . 
oh , it is , 
it's great . 
it's really her joy 
and i suppose that's why i enjoy gardening ,
i think so too . 
we also grow , um , yellow and green squash ,
 and , uh , we grow a lot of tomatoes , uh , 
there's just no replacement for fresh grown tomatoes . 
so , we enjoy that , 
um , we grow 
i have been trying to grow watermelon and cantaloupe and get teased by my family 
but i actually was successful for the last two years , 
i'm going to do it again . 
bet you showed them . 
that's right . 
and we grow broccoli . 
and i have been very , uh , happy about the new way of controlling the , uh , worm that gets in broccoli , um , by using the bacillus thuringiansis which is the , uh , little , 
well , in fact , that's what they use for gypsy moth , 
i don't know if you have had that problem there or not . 
but from the new england area . 
and they devastate the trees 
so this , uh , bacillus , um , the worms ingest it 
and it expands in their , um , digestive tract 
and they die . 
so , that's the same technique that is , you know , for any of the other , uh , little varmints that get in vegetables 
so it , 
that's really very nice because it's a non toxic way of handling the problem . 
well , we could really talk gardening a long time . 
i'm enjoying hearing you so much .
 well , it's nice hearing you talk 
and i wish you , uh , good luck , 
have you just recently moved to charlotte ? 
um , a , 
oh , so , well , that's not very long . 
uh , so , yes , 
and it , 
the weather is wonderful , 
i love it . 
oh , that's great , 
it is just terrific , 
you know , rains a little too often . 
well , i hope you have an opportunity to garden again . 
oh , i think so , 
i have a little spinach .
oh , well , good .
so , um , how do you think we've changed in the last ten to twenty years ? 
uh , i'm at a little bit of a loss , 
you know , i don't know , 
ten years ago , 
see i'm about , uh , twentyeight now 
things haven't changed a whole lot . 
people are being a little less bigoted in some ways , 
i don't know 
seems to me . 
i guess i'm like my parents . 
the younger generation gets away with hell , 
but , uh , 
well , it seems to me that civic freedoms are more restricted 
but that may just be because i've changed . 
you know , i used to live up north . 
down here , dallas , seems to me , the police are militant 
 but , uh , 
where'd you live up , 
where'd you live at , 
i lived in akron , ohio . 
oh , did you ? 
i'm from    , illinois , 
how long you been in dallas ? 
oh , about eight years . 
oh , really ? 
in fact in the eight years i've been here it seems to me it gets to be more and more restrictive place to live .
yeah , uh 
 you know , uh , as you're talking like police and stuff like that it's definitely a tough job to do . 
i think it's , 
crime has got a lot worse in the last 
oh , yeah , 
i agree . 
and maybe that has a lot to do with it . 
i definitely think that has gotten a lot worse , 
and you know , i think there's , 
to me there seems to be a little bit of a decline in the family values . 
that's true . 
but , uh , 
i'd say my own personal lifestyle has improved 
 but that's more a matter of , 
you know 
i think there's more pressure like on both parents to work , and things like that than there used to be 
hang on just a second . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i see a lot more , you know , double income families and a lot more like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that , i guess . 
that's true , 
it's getting more and more expensive to live . 
that's for sure . 
you can't make it , 
without it hardly , 
that's right . 
i guess , when i was growing up , get a home and buy house , 
  and these days you see a lot of people living in apartments 
 you know , you just don't buy a house , 
just because they can't get into one , 
that's right . 
the ways our tax laws and stuff are structured , you can't ever catch a break until you can get into a house 
so . yeah , 
that's a good point 
so , i'm trying to think of anything else that's changed over the last ten or twenty years . 
for me it's kind of hard , 
i don't know . 
i think , 
i don't know , i think the middle class is shrinking and the , uh , lower class is expanding 
oh , yeah , 
i agree . 
 and sooner or later there's going to be a turn around . 
well , i hope so , you know , at some point 
but i don't know at what point , 
but i think it's going to be at the expense of the middle class , uh 
 so , usually is 
it's , uh , 
it's hard for me to say . 
i hope it happens , because i'd be one of those that gets caught . 
but on the other hand , there's a lot of injustice that needs to be changed . 
that's right . 
do you work at t i ? 
do you ? 
what , uh , department do you work in ? 
i'm in semiconductor . 
are you ? 
i'm in semiconductor division too . 
so . how long you been with them , since you moved down here ? 
about eight years , 
um , i'm over at the center one building . 
so am i . 
are you really . 
what floor ? 
i'm on the seventh floor . 
well , it's a small world . 
 so let's see , 
second floor , you work with , uh , linear . 
uh , do you know alec morton ? 
oh , you do , huh . 
well , he comes up and pushes us around 
uh , so i'm pretty familiar with , 
are you d a d or something up there ? 
his reputation precedes him . 
well , seventh floor . 
t a d , 
well , uh , uh , boy , he comes up there and gives us all kinds of grief . 
they say it's what makes him happy is to give us d a d ers grief , 
so i can believe it 
let's see , if you've been in dallas eight years , i guess that's about how long , 
i've been in here about eight years , too , i guess . 
um , been with t i like twelve , 
but i started out in lubbock . 
lubbock is , 
i don't know , 
i guess if this is the only place you've lived , lubbock is a lot different than dallas . 
flat , dry 
but the people all seem to be a lot more laid back , too , 
i mean , here in dallas everything is just real rush , rush . 
i lived in the country for several years , 
and living in the city is a whole different 
oh yeah . 
but , uh , 
well , i got some friends that , uh , 
seems like he went to school at like devry . 
is there a devry in akron ? 
i don't even know 
i haven't been up there in years . 
oh , i see , 
well , he went to school somewhere in ohio , 
and he's from that area , 
and , uh , he works over in the park central building i think 
but , uh , i haven't talked to him in a while , 
but , um , yeah , 
he misses it . 
he used to go back twice or three times a year , you know , because he missed it . 
sounds like you haven't been back there in a while . 
i haven't been back in ten , fifteen years . 
you still have relatives back there 
i just haven't had a chance to get back .
catch them next year probably . 
well , let's see , 
i don't know , 
well my kids are probably needing me to go 
all right , 
well , it's nice talking to you . 
talk to you later . 
all righty , 
 well , kathleen , do you believe that there is a problem with our public school system ? 
 uh ,  . . .
 and what do you think that problem is ? 
and i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that we don't train our teachers very well . 
and then we put the schools in the hands of professional educators instead of the teachers and the parents . 
and then , 
they're social services . 
huh . that seems like you've thought this through quite a bit before . 
well , as a matter of fact , i just finished editing a book on the topic . 
so i have some rather strong opinions . 
that's interesting . 
do you , uh , yourself  . . . 
 and i'm sure they're colored by what i've edited . 
do youself have children who are or have been through the public school system ? 
and i was not very happy with the results . 
i see . 
so if you were to improve it , what would you do to improve it ? 
 well , i think i would start with getting rid of about twothirds of the administrators .
and then i would uh , use the money that we've paying them to , uh , provide some special help in training and particularly , uh , mentor teachers 
and then let them try some innovative things and see what 
pay attention to what's happening . talk to the teachers . uh , talk to their kids about school . and support the institution 
and , a , 
instead of becoming adversaries to the teachers so that uh , the teacher's in the middle . 
that's , uh , some pretty good ideas . 
why don't you do something with those  ? 
 well , i've done about all i can do which is get the manuscript in good shape so that it can be published and read by a lot of people . 
well , you should , uh , run for a school board position . 
oh , well . that i'm not so sure about . 
i've got a lot of things to keep me busy . 
that  . . . 
have you done anything like that ? 
anything political ? 
well , my mother was on the school board .
and , uh , that , basically , is the extent to which our family has been directly , you know , 
they've always been involved . 
my parents through the p t a organization . 
and my mother was on the school board for eight years . 
but , uh , than some people , less than others .
that's more than a lot .
i would , uh , tend to agree with you that there is a problem .
the methods of correcting it i haven't thought through quite to the detail which you have . 
but i believe that there's definitely a basic perception and image problem with the fact of even being a teacher . 
and if there was a way uh , uh , a little more prestige to being a teacher . 
and with that , of course , you know , you have to pay them accordingly . 
if we paid them more , it would attract more to either move into that field or to continue in that field . 
 and then if you paid them more , you'd also be able to demand a higher quality product out of them . 
i think that's absolutely right . 
the thing that worries me about that is that if you just raise salaries across the board , you're going to be ,
so we'd have to have some way to , uh , reward and recognize the teachers who are doing a good job and give them a , 
and it's a business or an occupation that the results are not as tangible 
it's hard to tell . 
so you kn , how a person scores in the beginning before the class and then after the class . 
you know , if there's some gauge that they could make . 
uh , also , about the idea of making teaching and the  , 
before you can get a certificate , you have much like a doctor . 
maybe not the four years definitely . 
but some certain type of position where you're overseen to begin with . 
now that's a very good suggestion . 
 uh , just something to , i , 
rather than throw someone into that environment , uh , you know , it 
i don't think 
i thought that maybe something . 
i think 
and then the student teacher didn't stay but about six weeks . 
so there really was no time to try ,
there are lots of things that could be done in that line , including things like video taping . because it wouldn't be hard with all the electronic equipment that's around these days to video tape , uh , either a master teacher teaching a class so that then ,
and then also to video tape the student teachers so they could correct their own performance . 
that's good as a teaching aid . 
but more you see these commercials that have jimmy walking into class late and it happens that the teacher is an instructor who is in new york while jimmy's in rome . 
and , you know , the whole electronic classroom idea . 
i don't know if i i'm 
i don't think that's going to work . 
i think , especially in the younger years you need to have more of to learn how to learn . 
well , another thing i think would be helpful would be to have some sort of say a national curriculum . because one of the problems with getting good textbooks is that we have such a fragmented system for , uh , curriculums that the textbook makers produce a textbook that will sell in texas and california . 
and then everybody else is stuck with that , regardless of what they want to teach . 
is that 
 because it  . . . 
i see . 
uh , and so it , uh , 
i used to work for a textbook publisher 
and it was absolutely clear that if you could get your book adopted by texas , then you had a builtin market because there were only about three or four textbooks in each subject 
and all you had to do is just get your share of those adopted 
and , you know , a third of the texas market with its millions of kids is a heck of a lot of textbooks . 
and then the states that either don't adopt on a state wide basis or don't have as many kids , just have to follow along and take what texas gets . 
  california is the biggest for elementary schools 
but texas , uh , adopts state wide all the way through the twelfth grade . 
i see . 
well , definitely is a national problem that they need to address . 
sure is . 
definitely is . 
and i hope maybe we're going to get somewhere with a little more attention being paid to it with , uh , reagan's , uh , new education secretary uh , trying to produce some new programs anyway . 
excuse me . 
well , i've enjoyed speaking with you . 
i have got to go . 
i've got another line calling . 
all righty . 
that's okay 
so , tell me about your home . 
oh , uh , it looks like a little shot gun house , almost . 
it's got three bedrooms going along one side and the living room and kitchen on the other . 
it's , uh , an older home , 
it's not new , 
i like it though , 
it's big . 
oh really , 
what kind of square footage ? 
oh , i wouldn't know , 
i measured it one time ,
and we thought about getting it sprayed . 
i think it was like , 
i can't remember , 
i'm sorry 
that's okay , 
it's big enough for us , though . 
we kind of need maybe one more room . 
we've got two children . 
so where do you live at , 
i mean here in denison . 
see , that's north . 
or down here in denison , 
i live in plano , 
so it's north to me .
up here then .
i say down , 
i'm really from kentucky . 
i was going to say you didn't have the typical , 
you have a southern accent , 
 but you don't have a texas accent . 
well i'm originally from , uh , ohio , cincinnati , 
 oh , okay . 
 so i'm uh , familiar with , uh , 
that area , 
that dialect . 
also i lived in georgia for about four years , 
so the , uh , 
there's a difference too , between east and west , in the south .
anyway , my home um , i guess it's about twentyfive hundred square foot 
and i have , uh , four bedrooms at the present . 
we're busting out walls and things like that . 
that's what i want to do . 
how many kids do you have ? 
we have two , 
do you have enough bedroom space , then ? 
we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small . 
and so , we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it . and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit . 
that's kind of like what we'd like to do . 
we just had a baby a couple months ago 
and we've got a den , 
it's more or less a spare room . 
we rarely go in there , except for to play chess . 
we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter 
and , uh , we need the one extra room . 
the bedrooms are too small , 
the living room and kitchen are huge , 
 but the bedrooms are too small . 
where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way , you can't rearrange it at all . 
there's they , uh , 
i know what you're saying there , 
ours is the same 
and they tend to put windows in the strangest places . 
 you know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for , 
we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom . 
you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything , 
no privacy . 
we don't have a lot of that , 
well , we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house . 
i'd hate to clean these windows , 
i really would . 
 i figured i'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean . 
ours are the double pane 
and you can't really clean them on the inside , you know . 
ours are those too , 
you must live in an older home too then . 
i do , 
the house is about , um , i'd say almost thirty years old . 
 so it's not a new home , 
it's seen some wear and tear .
ours has too . 
when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it , 
 and he did it hisself , 
so most of that , by now , is falling apart . 
 you know , well i mean , it's not just horrible , 
but like this tile's come loose off the wall , 
the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile 
and i don't like that at all . 
um , that is awful . 
with that , uh , the great big square tiles like , that you put on the floor ,
he did it in that ? 
i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles , 
for that you put , 
the normal tiles , 
that you put around a bathtub , 
that would be prettier . 
 but this looks like floor covering on the wall . 
it just doesn't look good . 
oh , and also they're very heavy 
and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier . 
there's one big one that has come off 
and short of putting nails through it , we can't get it back on , 
and he rewired the house 
and it's shorting out here and there , 
oh , wow , 
that's one of the things we've been fortunate with , is our , uh , wiring is okay . 
we don't have enough power , 
um , or our breakers to really help with the load in the house . 
 i mean we need to redo some , rewiring ourselves 
but our plumbing is awful . 
there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work , 
 and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house , 
so if something breaks , we have to shut it off from the main , in the street ,
and , oh , it can be really bizarre . 
and we never know where it's going to flood . 
we've got power surges on the west side of our house . 
we've got our stereo hooked up . 
well that , 
the power makes it run . 
it's never ran , 
it's always ran just fine , the clock and stuff . 
but it runs about ten minutes fast , except the clock ran normal . 
and then the power went off again , 
lightning or something knocked it out 
and we hooked it back up 
and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again . 
but on the east side of the house it runs fine . 
oh boy , you do have a strange wiring problem there . 
 he put new wiring in , 
it's all new wiring up in the attic ,
he didn't know what he was doing , 
he really should have hired people . 
well that's something , 
my husband's in construction 
and he won't even touch electrical stuff . 
he , i , 
i mean , he'll do a little   things 
but he won't do any major rewiring . 
he says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it . 
he'll end up killing himself . 
that's right . 
my husband , he'll change out a light switch , 
but that's about as far as he'll go . 
well that's the way mine is , you know , 
 i mean , well he said he went up in the attic and looked around 
and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry , 
uh , was a what , 
the roof was really sorry . 
i mean when we moved in ,
it was a wood shingle roof , 
and we , 
the first year we were living there , we had to replace the roof . 
well he put , 
i heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles . 
is it three or five , 
husband probably knows . 
he probably knows , 
i don't know what it is off hand . 
well , he's got seven layers of shingles up there , 
and he told us it was a completely new roof . 
like i said , he didn't know what he was doing . 
he must not of . 
we stripped ours off . 
we didn't put it over , 'cause we put composition roof on . 
and we completely stripped all the old wood shingles off , put decking up , put the paper down , and i mean just started from scratch . 
unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain . 
oh , no . 
we had almost , i'd say about half of the roof off , 
and it did this . 
and , uh , uh , a house full of snow . 
and a house full of snow , and rain , 
 and it came down , 
it did this in the middle of the night . 
we have plastic , you know , just tied down on everything , you know , as best we could ,
and the wind came in from the north 
and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night 
and we were asleep 
 and i woke up 
and i got up 
and it was about four o'clock in the morning 
and i heard all these drips , drip , drip , drip , drip , drip , drip . 
oh , no . 
i had water coming in every light fixture . 
i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling , everywhere . 
and i mean it filled up my light fixtures , because they're the old kind . 
 and i would go in , 
and i'd turn on a light in the room , you know 
and the light would come on 
and the whole thing would be full of water . 
and i mean the light would still come on . 
it didn't blow up or anything .
 or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana , her , 
we all lived on base , 
my husband was in the army . 
she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning , water dripping from hers . 
the neighbor's uh , washing machine had uh , over done something , 
i don't know 
but it was leaking , just pouring water in 
and it all went through to her roof 
and it was coming out of the lights , fixtures . 
the fire alarm went off for some reason . 
it shorted it out , or something . 
oh , yeah , 
that will happen . 
so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house . 
oh , my lord . 
not six feet 
but it's quite a bit , quite a bit , 
you know that , 
you might as well 
so . did you have carpets and stuff ? 
oh , several of our rooms got ruined , 
we have , um , 
we are on pier and beam , 
we don't have concrete slab underneath our house , 
 so it got into the carpeting , got into the floor . 
the carpeting was already awful anyway , 
but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink 
your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too . 
oh really . 
they came in 
and they had it , 
one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it . 
we had to call the insurance company . 
i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof 
but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the roof was being repaired .
 i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather .
that's right . 
well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end . 
oh yeah 
are you finished with it now ? 
uh , the roof ? 
oh yeah , 
we're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof . 
how long have you lived there ? 
uh , see , it's three , 
it's just been at three years . 
we've been in the house just the three years . 
we've been doing a lot of remodeling . 
i mean , detached garage 
and my husband's built a walkway across 
and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that 
so we , 
you all did it yourselves ? 
what , uh , the walk ? 
the home improvements . 
oh yeah , 
 i mean this is what , 
well , uh , quite a few 
and they're varied . 
they don't , uh , uh , encompass , uh , many handcrafts like knitting and that kind of thing . 
but , i do , uh , quite a bit of wreath making 
and my dogs are my hobbies . 
i do a lot of gardening . 
i go to estate sales , which takes up a lot of time . 
now , what do you mostly do  ? 
well , mostly right now i do a lot of sports and stuff like that is my hobbies and do a lot of things with my family as much as possible . 
uh , we're about to take the kids to go roller skating and a birthday party and stuff , 
that should be fun . 
fun for them . 
how old are they ? 
uh , i've got a little girl who's six and a little girl that's three . 
well , i think that's better than having that party at home .
well , uh , this is a friend's party 
and they rented , 
or , you know , they , 
the party , 
they , uh , just rent skates and stuff for the kids . 
 so , uh 
boy , what a help that is . 
so , uh , 
what kind of , 
how long have you lived in north carolina ? 
well , not that long . 
uh , just since october . 
we moved here from enid , oklahoma . 
so , uh , we're originally from virginia , this part of the country . 
but , we did spend twenty years in norman and enid 
but , we needed to get back , uh 
but , i am loving it .
the weather is divine . 
w , uh , 
did you like oklahoma ,
 oh , yes . 
um , what did you all do ? 
well , my husband was with , uh , university of oklahoma and ,
and then he went with , uh , a family corporation that uh , has oil and ranching and varied enterprises . 
and , uh , he just quit a perfectly good job and we .
so , uh , is he working there then 
or  , 
he's doing , uh , quite a bit of consulting work and ,
 oh , uhhuh . 
and he's contemplating .
he's liking this free time actually .
oh , yeah . 
it's just wonderful after all ,
uh ,  ,
 oh , i see . 
i see . 
uh , what is her name ? 
her name's tina .
but , uh , uh , like i said , we're party , 
 but , uh , some  of   , 
so , that's interesting . 
well , you haven't told me , uh , what sports that you are active in . 
well , the sport i like best probably is basketball . 
but , uh , i guess i'm probably better at softball . 
and so i'd , 
like during the summer months it's , occupies quite a bit of my ,
but , i play in a couple of leagues and occasionally in a tournament or something on a weekend . 
but , my family usually goes with me . 
we try to do everything we can together . 
well , i think that's , uh , easy entertainment for a ,
well , they , uh , 
a good friend of mine that plays on one of my teams , we , uh , 
that's usually the team i play on with the tournaments and stuff , 
and they have a couple of kids that are almost my kids age . 
so they play together ,
under the stands . 
under the ,
and , uh , tina enjoys , uh , the other lady ,
so they , 
you know , that's kind of nice . 
it's like getting together with ,
well , it's been raining a lot here so far . 
so we haven't really had any kind of real heat . 
i think it's going to be warm enough this afternoon , we were noticing a while ago it's already eighty in the house . 
so , it looks like an air conditioner ,
it sure does . 
or maybe this evening anyway . 
but , you know , i'm sure you're familiar with that living ,
we go through enid , you know , quite a bit . 
we go to tulsa from time to time . 
and my parents live in southern illinois . 
so , we drive ,
and , well , lot of times we take seventyfive 
and , uh , it seems like that goes through enid ,
it doesn't . 
i've either seen the signs or , 
enid is , uh , 
it's in the northwest . 
it's , uh , directly across the uh , state from tulsa . 
 um . i know i've seen ,
sure you have . 
well , enid is ,
it , uh 
an awful lot of people know where it is , or have been there . 
and it ,
the bottom fell out . 
oh , uhhuh . 
it's beginning to do well . 
but , there's a lot of , uh , old time wealth there that ,
oh , uhhuh . 
so , uh , how l , 
you said you've just lived in north carolina just like , 
i've heard so many people talk about that area . 
i've never been there 
but they sure ,
the weather is wonderful . 
uh , this winter we , 
it was just , 
we had so many wonderful days . 
 uh , i , 
if it got to be forty degrees , i decided it was too cold to walk the dogs .
isn't it ,
my wife and i spent a couple years , uh , doing church work up in the state of washington right ,
and it rains ,
but , you get used to it . 
i mean , it's like a fine mist all the time 
and it doesn't really , 
it gets to where it doesn't bother ,
the moss grows ,
that's the way it was , there , too . 
i think , however , that's like february . 
uh , i know it did it all february . 
oh , uhhuh . 
well , i know you ,
and i've enjoyed talking to you . 
well , i have enjoyed talking to you , too . 
it was nice ,
thanks so much . 
have a , 
i hope you enjoy ,
 oh , thank you . 
 and i hope you enjoy , 
well , i hope ,
i do , 
that's what i hope . 
thanks a lot . 
uh , how long have they been recycling there in virginia ? .
um , actually quite a while . 
um , i've lived here for six years 
oh , i'm sorry 
uh , so , they've been doing that it for a while now 
 and , uh , it , 
i live in an apartment 
 and my ap ,  facilities   , 
hold on .
sorry about that .
you're okay , 
uh , anyhow , they have facilities here in my apartment complex for recycling paper only . 
uh , i've been recycling for maybe about two years now and , at another public facility 
recycled plastic also ? 
we have out here 
but not all that many , 
it wasn't very well advertised 
 but recently , uh , the refuse department uh , is working on getting a system going where we will actually have , uh , a bend that we put things in for recycling these other things 
 so it should be good , uh , 
i think it's a marvelous idea uh , when i just think of the papers that i dump out 
 i mean there just , 
it's such a 
i waste , 
i just hate to think about it . 
now an additional thing is , uh , 
where i work 
 so , i mean , a lot of people , you know , right at the vending machines ,
and near the ,
you know , i keep a little box at my desk , you know , 
 and as i'm using the white paper , you know , i just throw it right in there , 
 and then , you know , they have someone that comes around and pick it up , you know , every afternoon 
that's neat . 
that's right . 
i guess one of the things , i think , that needs to happen is we need to be better informed about , 
there's needs to be more public , uh , 
i would agree with that . 
 and there's , 
i've seen a few things but not very much ,
and i think that's a shame 
they need to , uh , do a little more , 
i'd like to know , for instance , when they say , uh , plastic , all plastic , what kind of plastic ,
uh , now maybe they just sort it after they get it and throw out what they can't use , 
i don't know 
 but i'd be glad to organize it ,
i agree with you there , 
another thing that i like here which is , 
i do with , 
i have to actually go to two different recycling areas because one of them is that , uh , 
their aluminum cans is for , uh , children's hospital , for a burn fund 
 so all the monies are donated , you know , 
that's great . 
now that gives , 
 and before even at work , 
before they started the recycling plan , which at work they've only been doing since january first of this year , i had had everyone in my department recycling 
and , you know , i would have them drop , 
saving them for you , uh . 
and then i would haul them , you know , here to this place for the children's hospital fund 
i think that's , 
enthusiastic about it ,
there you go . 
 that's for sure . 
but i think that's 
and i'm sure , you know , in the near future i would think they would be coming out with more , 
 you know , i've seen a definite trend , you know , towards more recycling ,
i'm glad , 
i think it is getting more , you know , advertisement . 
people are becoming more conscience all the time that it's necessary to do ,
 and all these things that , 
i think that's true . 
well , i think , 
i'm that's about my , uh  ,
but i enjoyed talking to you . 
well , i did too . 
all right , 
bye now . 
i have , uh , 
that there really was not any more crime in america , in the cities , anyway , than there was in previous centuries , uh , before , uh , 
simply because . 
the reason there seems to be so much was the fact that the police now had advanced , uh , reporting methods , with computers and other devices . 
compile more statistics . 
that's right , 
and those statistics in turn got them bigger budgets . 
however , i have been persuaded , lately , i guess , simply by the , uh , overwhelming data that seems to be available that there is indeed a lot more violent crime . 
more especially where you are . 
well , yeah . 
i was going to say , 
actually it , 
you know , i do a lot of business here , 
and i come here quite often 
is a sort of media perception there's some absolutely lovely and marvelous and peaceful areas in washington .
oh , yeah . 
but it's real , uh , 
there's pockets of violence that is so violent that they , uh , 
it just really grabs your attention . 
it just makes the whole place seem like that . 
now just to focus on that a minute , i guess , uh , uh , 
when , uh , previous secretary of , uh , educa , bennett , i think his name was ,
and i see that even he was met quite a bit of money and other , uh , planning efforts went into that . 
what do you think is causing all this , 
because , it seems that there 
even though 
crime , though i think it is increasing in number , it sure does seem to be increasing in intensity ,
well , i have three theories about it ,  you know , three things .  
i have one theory , 
and it's  brought to us  by two things . 
one i believe that this is a function of , uh , the violence that young people see on television and the movies . 
and , i am not just talking about , you know , uh , role models of tough guys and gangsters and things like that , 
the immediate need to show some sort of violence to settle th , 
i am an advocate of hand gun control to some degree , 
so i think that particularly 
  the highest , 
i think it's corpus christi , that had the highest rates per hand gun death in america 
i have not seen that , 
but , uh , 
i mean the saturday night special stuff 
that's what i think about it , 
that's some of the things i think about it , 
plus i do not know , 
what are your views ? 
well , yeah , 
i tend to agree with you with , you know , 
it seems anymore , uh , a movie can not be considered good unless there's just some sort of violence ,
and along with that , you know , 
and then you start making a movie and there's no call for something violent , 
so they just throw something in there just to say they have it .
well that's the impression i get , you know . 
  you know , it just feeds upon itself when we have this sort of violence in society , 
people want to , 
it conditions people to it 
and , uh , you have to amp , 
it has to be even , uh , magnified to attract people's attention . i guess ,
you become callous . 
and i am sure that it does form role models for young men and young women 
uh , i mean i , read now where we are , you know , 
over whatever . 
seems that those things did not happen in that manner before television . 
and that it has some influence on it . 
i listened to a radio talk show today at lunch time 
i do not know if you listen to him or not , 
he's on a m , 
but , there's a fellow that had called in and was lamenting about the , 
there was an interview done on the assistant chief of police for los angeles , the guy under gates , 
oh , yes . 
and they were just really coming down on him because of just some of the things that he believed in , some of his morals . 
for instance , uh , they asked him if he spanked his kids , 
and people , confused discipline with punishment . 
you know . 
and , just , 
it seems anymore that , uh , if you have , you know , this type of a moral stance , that people come down on you . 
it's like , you know , hey , everybody has to be free to do their own thing . 
and i disagree , 
and i think that's really contributing to this high rate of crime . 
well , i mean , to prison that the rehabilitation programs seem to be a failure . 
 and that is not emphasized . 
i recognize there's over crowding problems 
that's complicated the entire process . 
what i also think that , 
i guess it's the reflection of the society where we have so much more mobility and less attachment to , uh , 
you know , it does not seem to be any responsibility to the community where you live 
or . i do not mean attachment and responsibility , 
i guess i mean any sort of , 
well , nobody feels responsibility to do something . 
it's like , oh boy , i wish they would stop doing that . 
that's right . 
i do not know how that's , 
i do not think it's done by , uh , 
the changes come simply by statutory nature . 
i do not know what it really will take .
 and , i do not know if i have solutions , except to , 
you know , i am sort of of having free speech 
and i guess to curb , uh , 
uh , the violence on television and in the movies would be contrary to my beliefs in that . 
however , there does seem to be a , 
right now in verbalizing , 
it does seem to be a higher need for something of that sort . 
and then how many , 
and the sacrifice is not that great . 
how many studies have to be done to show that there is a link between ,
i mean , what you see affects how you think and therefore what you do . 
i think that's correct . 
and , yes 
but , you know , as soon as you start , uh , 
well , uh , has always struck me , 
i mean i have lived in and out of texas , both in the service and , uh , uh , short business stints . 
and it seems to me they are a pretty tough law and order state , 
but  that's a ,  
but yet that does not seem to have effected the amount of violent right in the state . 
just citing that , you know . 
uh , unfortunately you have got a lot of the , uh , 
the racial differences , i mean , just that we are so close ,
we have got a lot of that influence . 
and , uh , the first three days , 
it's the , 
i've only made , 
oh , i know . 
sometimes i just 
i'm , in , 
it just takes a very long time 
does it ? 
i know . 
this is hilarious .
but i knew as soon as i heard your voice , 
well , let's see , 
um , gosh , i can't even think . 
i haven't read any , 
and you're such a reader , i know that 
and i , 
well , i don't read all that much for enjoyment . 
i mean , i read a lot for school , 
but gee , i just don't have much time for enjoyment reading .
the last book i picked up was a book by judy bloom , 
 and um , it was called , um , smart women , i think .
and it was kind of , 
i really didn't like it at all . 
it was written back in the early eighties . 
oh , yeah . 
and it was all this , um , divorced woman syndrome 
oh , yeah . 
it was almost like a preaids scare kind of thing . 
it was really an interesting , 
because i right away looked at when it was copyrighted .
that kind of was , um , kind of a pop psychology time for when a lot of books like that were coming out , i think . 
that's right . 
and so that makes real sense , that that's , um , when it was written . 
um , i wasn't really aware that she had written anything for , um , adults . 
i was always ,
and she's more famous for that , 
but she has been writing for adults also , 
i'll be darned . 
it was very , um , 
 the style was very conversational . 
you would have lots of conversations between people 
you know how that is , 
and um , 
i wonder if she's written anything really recently , if she's got anything in print . 
because i remember seeing a new book by her 
and i think it was an adult book . 
i'll be darned . 
so anyway , 
but that's the last thing i've read , 
 and , um , 
well , it's , 
i'm trying to think the last actual book i read that wasn't , 
let's see , i think i read , oh , 
when i was you know , on semester break between spring and summer 
 and i went to my mother's , 
i read a book that i should have read when i was probably in high school . 
i read , um , jane eyre . 
wait a minute , 
wait a minute , 
wait a minute . 
jane eyre ? 
wuthering heights ? 
 oh , yeah , 
by jane austen , 
that's what it was , 
and , um , you know , that jane austen was such a wonderful novelist , 
and she really was good . 
i mean , i was very much impressed with the way her plot was put together so ,
 um , and , you know , i just , 
but as i say , i was pretty much ashamed that i hadn't read something before then . 
because i think i read it in college ,
but i don't remember it . 
and then when jennie had to read it at gettysburg 
i think it was , um , oh , some actress reading it . 
oh , how interesting . 
you know , they had an abridged version of it on tape . 
and so i got that for her , 
and she loved doing that . 
oh , i'll bet , 
but i remember that was the book . 
and now i mean , i think it's around here somewhere , 
i wouldn't be , 
i'm just going to have to put it ,
oh , yeah . 
but , um , 
well , i read that , 
and then i'm trying to think , um , 
usually i try to find something long that ,
if i have long periods of time , like christmas vacation , or , you know , when i know i'm not going to be doing anything for a while , um , 
oh , that's what i do too . 
and that's about it , because otherwise i'm reading so much for school . 
um , i have just started reading a book . 
actually , it's for school , 
but it's for , um , 
there's a literary jour , 
well , not a literary journal , 
that's starting to be published , um , from u t d . 
the first issue doesn't come out until next year , 
but , um , 
 oh , yeah . 
i'm doing some reviews of books , whether or not a fullscale review should be done for the journal , 
 oh , how neat . 
 and i've , 
it's really neat because these are brand new books 
and i ,
 oh , great . 
um , most of the stuff is on , uh , literary criticism and philosophy ,
this one is on johann sebastian bach , 
and it's a biography ,
 oh , great . 
oh , that's fascinating . 
i mean , it's fascinating , 
it really is . 
um , but it's so long , 
i don't really have the time to read the whole thing , 
but i think ,
but it's , 
i mean the copyright is nineteen ninetyone , 
so it's a brand new book . 
oh , it's a brand new book . 
oh , that would be wonderful 
 and this man really shed some light on , um , some ,
i mean , you know , that was 
and they just went from generation ,
that's right . 
and , um , 
that's the way it was , i'm sure back then . 
so , uh , 
oh , that's interesting . 
it was just really interesting , 
if you know , that's kind of what , 
but i have to 
not only on music , 
 um , and i'm supposed to decide whether i think this man might be a worthy person to be you know , in that position on the board 
 oh , yeah . 
i don't know if i want to take that responsibility or not , 
wow , that's rough . 
that's real rough . 
so , um , 
it is . 
i think that's probably sort of a thing to do 
 but , um , 
that it , 
you know , you see a lot of small colleges doing things ,
because it attracts really a lot people's interest . 
that's one way , 
it's really good public relations for small schools , 
 oh , yeah . 
i think so .
but , uh , another one of my projects this summer of various poems for a book that he's writing , 
now , translations , what do you mean , translations of , 
um , well , where , for instance , um , a baudelaire poem that was written ,
oh , i see . 
and the translations are all so different from one another . 
all different . 
oh , that's interesting . 
so it's multiple translations of single works 
right now pretty much what i'm doing as far as , um , 
my work , is just kind of compiling ,
that's great . 
it's real interesting . 
boy , you really lift me up to a different , 
 i mean , here i'm dealing with , uh , 
 you know ,  , 
that would be nice . 
i don't know if i've told you , 
what do you think about it ? 
well , such as the health field , the transportation field , uh , 
they're already doing it in the armed forces , where they handle weapons and so forth , uh , 
they do it to prisoners 
 so , i feel like it should be mandatory in some professions , 
and i think to drug test employees and they don't like it , then they should not be employed there .
that was , 
you know , i would not mind it . 
i especially agree that if it's an area where they could cause somebody else , you know 
and i don't have a problem at all with employers , uh , testing in the hiring process , 
but i don't have a problem with them too much , testing even after the fact , 
but i do a little bit where it wouldn't hurt anybody . 
i don't know , 
sometimes i think they carry it a little bit too far . 
unless an employer has a reason to 
i mean maybe it's , uh , 
 and then it's not a problem . 
number one because generally if they are involved in that type of thing they are into theft 
 and as an employer , i would think that would be , 
and the first , 
it's not going to be wholesale because of the cost . 
oh , absolutely . 
there's no way . 
 but my concern is , uh , school bus drivers . 
oh , yeah . 
the train drivers , 
um , i'm not even , 
i'm in education , 
i'm not even opposed to it for that . 
uh , i'm concerned in the medical field . 
i think they should screen for alcohol in these areas , too 
i wish they would . 
i wish they would , 
and that , i think , is even probably more widely abused 
but when you consider they could be driving an airplane 
oh , i know . 
 and it doesn't take that long . 
they don't have to be totally roaring drunk 
just a little 
just , uh , 
now t i has the random testing policy 
oh , okay . 
in a pool 
 so i've already been tested once when i was hired and once since they initiated this random testing program . 
but i work with one girl who was tested , her name got randomly selected three times in six months 
oh , my word . 
 and i think that's the only reason i have a problem with it , when you know , there's no reason 
that's getting a little bit , 
that's enough to make anybody paranoid .
well , as long as you accept that it is a random testing 
that way you can't feel like somebody's out to get me . 
it's almost like being selected for jury duty .
you know , so your name came out of pot when they spun the wheel , 
that's just the way it is . 
either just the lucky or the unlucky one , depending on how you look at it . 
i would rather have it that way , to know that i was chosen at random by a computer than to think that somebody turned me in 
oh , absolutely , 
there are so many people with their petty axes to grind 
it could really get 
so , i would really rather know , however , 
there's got to be some backup to say that 
say at a party , uh , using drugs 
to report it , 
and i guess you'd report that to a supervisor , maybe 
personnel , or something , 
i'd just 
i don't know what kind of work you do , 
but there would be , even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way . 
we have a lot of people who work on the line . 
i'm in accounting , 
so it wouldn't , 
you know 
but out on the line , they've got people working some 
especially given today , the drug abuse that goes on , i just think employers have to have some kind of way to see that they're not being put at 
put at risk . 
i agree 
 and i'm not sure but what some of the insurance claims aren't due to , uh , illnesses brought on by drug abuse or alcohol abuse . 
and in the long run , we're all paying for that 
 so i mean , it protects us in the long run hopefully 
i was trying to remember , there was a court case , uh , here where i live , just a few months ago . 
the city workers , they wanted to , um , 
the city government wanted to institute the random drug testing 
 and the city workers , uh , took them to court to protest , saying that it invaded the search and seizure amendment 
 and it's still tied up in the legal channels . 
they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not . 
so i'm curious especially since t i s 
to see how that's , 
is it , uh , just a small group of the employees that are concerned ? 
seems like the whole group of city employees that's raising a stink over it . 
they just don't want to be drug tested . 
you know , my husband and i have never been in a situation where somebody said you have to be drug tested . 
uh , my husband's retired from i r s agents . 
however , this isn't a problem that we have 
and so , in our minds we're thinking what's the big deal . 
that's the way i looked at it . 
if i had something to hide , it's one thing , 
but i'm , 
you know , you know you don't , 
so it's not as big a deal , 
and you sometimes wonder when these people protest so much whether they're really concerned 
 and then they say , well , if you give them the right to do this , then they're going to take some other right away from you , 
but i firm , 
i don't believe that . 
i think that an employer has the right to ask you to do anything , 
and , of course , you sign a paper saying that i will go take a , 
i'll let you start . 
do you all keep a budget , 
and how do you hold to yours ? .
my budget or philosophy , i guess , is spend as little as possible . 
well , that's good .
especially for these times . 
uh , but that depends , you know , on the individual if they can i guess have selfcontrol . 
well , that's a lot of it . 
uh , i know we tried several different ways . 
one time we tried something that really worked 
but we didn't keep it up . 
i passed it on to a friend 
and she won't quit doing it . 
she loves it 
and that was the envelope system .
and you put the cash in envelopes marked for that . 
so you have one for entertainment and one for groceries et cetera . 
and then for some reason taking it out of that envelope and seeing it in cash instead of in check form , uh , causes you to realize how much is left . 
and she even writes down on the envelope as she subtracts and kind of debits on each envelope ,
and then at the end pay period , if she has any left , that much is for fun or entertainment . 
and they kind of work it that way . 
we tried for a while 
and a seems like the problem that they were having of all the things that worked was not planning enough for the incidentals that we couldn't think about . 
and those are the ones that will kill you . 
you know , the accidental fee or the car repair or the things that weren't supposed to be every month . 
well , yeah , 
i couldn't probably be bothered doing that 
that's what i mean . 
it was a hassle .
uh , well , we've been married almost thirty years now 
but , uh , 
so you learn to get , 
you learn to get through , you know , to the end of the month 
and , uh , 
 but do you sort of self budget even , 
because if you charge things , uh , you pay all your bills at the beginning of the month ,
or you get paid the last day or next to the last day . 
you pay all your bills 
and there isn't anything left to spend anyway . 
well , that's true . 
what we're in the process of doing right now is paying off our credit cards entirely . 
and we're going to go ahead and try to just live on what we earn instead of guessing ahead of what we probably will have next month .
well , yeah , 
or we are paying them off now . 
we're not there yet . 
uh , there was a time when maybe we didn't take all of them off , 
but you just sort of had to watch what you put in ,
that's right . 
that's right . 
and for most of , uh , 
i mean i'm a substitute teacher , 
and i've only substituted , i guess , for the last fifteen years , 
so there's only been really one working . 
same here . 
and , uh , it works for me 
but i can't see that it would work for probably the majority of people . 
well , i could say it's kind of , 
you know , that's good . 
you probably have a little extra than you have to have , to , 
you know what i'm saying ? 
and so , that's the difference there where sometimes like i know if we've had an especially bad month and we're just almost getting down to payday , then i think if we could really budget , 
we tried one tim , 
i know when we were planning to buy the new car and we hadn't had a car payment in five years , we had to go ahead and write down each month what it was that every penny went for ,
and that was a real eye opener . 
but to have lived by that every week would have been tough for me because sometimes i'll spend less on groceries but we'll go out . 
so it's kind of hard to say this is how much you're going to spend going out for fun . 
this is how much you're going to spend .
it's kind of hard . 
 well , we eat out a good deal at this point . 
do you ? 
i started subbing just to go on a vacation and saved ,
we were going to go for ten weeks , uh , 
so i started ,
how nice . 
but the , 
what minuscule amount i made 
well , that's , 
 and it was paid for . 
and it made a big , 
and you enjoyed it better probably . 
yeah ,   .
and so i think that that's difficult for most people , 
but then my father was , 
i think so too . 
and , you know , you never could afford anything although we could afford everything if he wanted to . um , 
so if you're out like in a department store and there's a sale , you're just real careful not to let your urges get hold of you ? 
that's excellent . 
that's what i'm working toward . 
i think you're probably much ahead of me there 
and i'm working on it . 
and i never worried about saving money because we're in the savings plan at work 
and they took it out 
same here , 
i , uh , 
and i think though that we need to have some liquid around that you don't have to go through the company to get .
you know ? 
well , we never had too much of that 
 but then we never had any really emergencies that , uh , 
that came up . 
and we didn't buy really new or expensive cars . 
i think the most , we're looking at cars now , uh , we ever spent for a new car was like six thousand dollars . 
and they were mainly used cars . 
well , that's the best thing to do . 
my husband said the other day it was the worst mistake we ever did to buy a new car because it wasn't worth it from the day after . 
you know , we've been rather frugal in that . 
rather frugal . 
 well , that's going to payoff on retirement . 
well , it , uh , 
do you think we've been here to in , 
well , each time they used to call in and tell me their space is limited and to please , uh , 
how would you go about organizing a family reunion ? 
well , a , 
i grew up in the deep south like south alabama . 
so whenever i think of family reunions , 
my family , like , got together almost every week . 
oh , gee . 
and there would be like thirty people . 
so people talk about , you know , big family reunions 
and i think , like 
i have a friend who just went to , like , wyoming to some big ranch , you know , where like there were four hundred people 
oh , my . 
and i , 
so i mean , how i would go about doing it is i would just call all my relatives . 
because since i came from , 
my father has , uh , five sisters and two brothers 
and my mother has four brothers and two sisters . 
so i ca , 
both of my parents had big families , 
and we always got together , just always . 
now it's different because i live here 
and i , 
you know , when i go home i try to see the families , as much of the family as i can 
and i grew up in a real i think not normal setting . 
with all of you living so close together . 
i mean sunday dinner was at my grandmother's 
and , you know , like i said there would be you know , thirty people , 
and everyone would just bring things 
and i , 
well , i come from a very small family . 
and we planned a family reunion this spring . uh , where we are from texas 
and my family is from ohio 
and we met in florida . 
so the seven of us went on a cruise and then went to disney together . 
so that's all the family , 
so planning our family reunion was very easy  ,  you know  .
it really sounds like it was fun . 
well , we had a wonderful tim , 
i was waiting so long uh , for it to find somebody . um , 
well , so what is your favorite t v show ? 
uh , major dad . 
oh , you like that one ? 
i love it , 
i think it promotes good family values , 
and it's funny . 
uh , i've never really watched that one . 
you know , it's funny how you can just get in a mode where you only watch certain shows 
that's ri , 
 and , uh , you know , that i like to watch routinely . 
what kind do you like to watch ? 
probably my favorite is , um , oh , 
well , i like shows like growing pains 
and , uh , what's the other one now , they moved from tuesday night to wednesday night , 
so i don't get to watch it very much . 
wonder years ? 
wonder years , 
i like both of those real much also . 
they promote family values . 
wonder years , 
i guess that is supposed to be put out at a time when i was growing up or whatever . 
i guess i can really relate to it , 
and , uh , it's just a real cute show .
uh , i guess i like the shows that really have a real sense of , uh , i don't know , honesty or sort of a purity value , i guess . 
i do , too . 
that i've liked in the past , like , uh , oh , golden girls 
and , some of them tend to get so risque , 
and when you 
 and , uh , that's one of the reasons , 
i mean , if you want to go all time favorite show , probably one of them was little house on the prairie 
my wife really likes that show , 
which i always felt was wonderful 
 uh , and so many of them nowadays , like i said , i think are just , um 
 uh , they go after , well , 
like i said , the risque stuff , just i guess they think that's what people want to watch . 
well , there was , 
but there's a sense of i guess , purity in the show , 
like one of my favorite shows used to be happy days 
 but , uh , you know , richie always used to be you know , just so honest and pure 
and when he left the show , you know , it seemed to be missing that part of it 
 and i never did like it after that 
 so , i don't know , 
see the same thing in like wonder years and a lot of the shows that i like to watch . 
there always seems to be that kind of value in there somewhere . 
i agree . 
uh , do you like the sports programming ? 
um , as much to a certain extent . 
our whole house is baseball fans 
 and , uh , we enjoy that , 
and , uh 
so you're going to watch a game tonight ? 
 oh yeah , 
so do you have a favorite for the series or anything ? 
uh , probably the pirates , 
but only because of steve bushel , i guess 
oh , uhhuh . 
otherwise i really don't care that much , 
but , uh , you know , i'm annoyed that the rangers got rid of him , 
and , uh , i'd like to see him do well , like all the way to the bank 
he's a nice guy . 
i take it you live in the dallas area . 
do you live in the dallas area ? 
live in plano . 
i live in garland , 
and , yeah , 
i like steve bushel , 
but i don't really like the pirates . 
i'm a big saint louis cardinals fan 
 so , uh , i'm kind of pulling for the braves over all , 
i really would like to see them do well . 
well , yeah , 
it's , uh , 
so i keep hoping the rangers are going to do .
one year they , 
maybe they'll make it , i don't know 
 but , uh , yeah , 
i like sports programming quite a bit , 
but , uh , i guess my favorite shows are the , 
and , you know , that getting back to the point that you made , that's really true , 
we were watching roseanne , i guess , couple of weeks ago , 
and her daughter was talking about birth control , you know 
 and my daughter was kind of walking in during that time , 
and , you know , she's only seven years old , 
well , it's , 
so many of them now , um , you know , it just seems like they feel like they have to stick that stuff in , 
 and i have adult tastes now , 
but i don't need that 
 uh , are wholesome , i guess . 
well that seems to be more our values , too , 
like the wonder years , maybe for teenagers , 
you know , and you can kind of relate to it 
i don't know , 
i enjoy that a lot 
 but , uh , you know , i agree with you , 
and it's funny because the shows , 
like a lot of them that used to be considered risque , like three's company and stuff , i think they maintained , 
people would watch them because 
uh , you know , there was really the period that was going on there , 
i mean , he really wasn't messing around with the girls , 
but everybody perceived him that way , and stuff 
 but as soon as , you know , he went to move in with another girl , the show just died 
 and it's interesting that a lot of the shows are that way , 
i'm ready . 
do you work for t i ? 
oh , you do , 
well , you're like me then .
i stay home also . 
do you have children ? 
oh , that's good . 
how about you ? 
i have four girls 
they're nine and five and three and a newborn . 
oh , my , you are busy 
 and they're all girls , 
i have two girls , 
so , all girls around here .
anyway , as far as clothing goes , um , my wardrobe changes all the time , depending on my size .
that's how i am too . 
we go from regular kind of spring clothes 
 oh , that's funny . 
 and they're all in boxes or bags , 
and they all rotate all the time 
i said , who ever i talk to is going to be board , because when it's summer time , i'm wearing shorts , 
and when it's cold , i'm wearing sweat pants , and 
i like jeans a lot . 
well , that's good . 
i used to wear jeans all the time until after i had kids , 
and now nothing seems to be comfortable because i bulge in all the wrong places , 
oh , and it's frustrating , 
i find i have to get the right kinds , though , or it's not comfortable 
it works best if they have pleats in the front 
 and , uh , they have to , 
my waist is kind of small compared to the hips , 
so it has to be not the straight up and down levis kind .
i know what you mean . 
 um , but i , 
when i was pregnant through the summer this time 
that's right . 
 but , uh , 
one of my daughters was born in june , 
and i remember , i wore sundresses and , you know , just those real cool dresses almost the entire time .
and i had one that was born in december , 
so , um , it was a little bit , because it was a real warm winter 
 so even into like november and december i was still wearing the short sleeve dresses , 
course i'm always hot when i'm pregnant , too , 
i didn't really need warm clothes 
 but i really have been spoiled by sweat pants and these new , uh , units outfits , you know , that are just knit , 
oh , i haven't tried those , 
oh , they are so comfortable . 
it's just , um , you know , a light weight 
or you can just wear them with , you know , tennis shoes if you want . 
so they're really nice 
 and i've enjoyed wearing those 
 but i , 
but i sure never wear them .
well i don't either , 
if we had professional jobs where we go into an office and have to wear a jacket or something 
i worked part time when my oldest was a baby 
 and , um , i had to wear a dress every day , 
i'm watching , janice , 
i would have to drive six thirty five home 
and i would be burning up , like in the summer time 
i remember that from when i was , 
i worked way before i was married , even , 
but offices , they keep them so cold 
you've got to have something to 
i don't know if you can , 
and then when you drive home , like especially if you're in a lot of traffic 
you burn up , 
 because i always hated to run my air conditioner just sitting still all the time 
i was afraid i'd make the car overheat . 
it's hard on the car . 
so i would roll my windows down , 
it was still a hundred degrees 
 and i would just be sweltering hot by the time i picked my daughter up , 
and after work she'd go in the bathroom and change her clothes 
oh , that's funny , 
at least something cooler , 
because you can ruin your good clothes getting so hot in them 
that's true , 
i don't have to worry a whole lot about that . 
when you have children , you don't , 
um , even when i go to church i have to have something i can just throw in the washer when i'm through . 
that's right , 
something that it doesn't matter if it gets spit up on , too .
i know it . 
i've always been a creature of comfort , too 
me , too . 
if it's not comfortable , forget it . 
i know , 
that's how i am , too , 
wool was never comfortable to me . 
me neither , 
i have , 
where do you enjoy dining out ? 
oh , i generally go to the quickie places just because they're cheap . 
do you have children ? 
 so there might be , 
but we were taking , you know , uh , four , five and six people out .
 what area of the country do you live in ? 
i'm in texas . 
i am , too . 
and we lived in ohio prior to this . 
i did , too . 
i'm from the dayton area . 
uh , but i look for service even at the quickie places 
uh , i don't like to go to the drivethrus because sometimes they get your order wrong 
that's right . 
 and then you're stuck 
and it's a pain to have to stand there and see what it is before you leave 
 so i really don't like the drivethrus that much . 
i like to go and eat there . 
but i would say service , uh , atmosphere , and whether the food is good , 
and on going out , i like steaks . 
so , we try to hit those places when we can . 
when we travel we look for wendy's because we have kids , 
and my husband and i like getting the salads or the lighter meals 
 and then that way they can get their burgers and fries 
and we can have a salad bar 
 so sometimes we drive for a couple hundred miles until we find a wendy's ,
and , in the countries , unless it's a large city , i guess dairy queen and walmart are their main .
that's right , 
that's what you find , 
i know . 
my husband likes , uh , dairy queens . 
he likes their milk shakes and their chili cheese 
so he's a fan of dairy queen , 
a change although 
but we eat out so much it's gotten so i don't like to really eat any place 
but yet i hate to cook food at home 
 so that might be why i look for inexpensive places 
or we eat junk food at home 
 uh , now my husba , 
well , what are some of your favorite inexpensive places ? 
oh , we'll go to them all . 
we sort of take turns . 
and we , uh 
i sort of favor the ones , 
if i have a coupon we can go there 
and if not we can't , because it's cheaper 
 so mine is , i guess strongly monetarily based . 
uh , we'll go get pizza uh , at little caesar's , although the kids prefer domino's . 
oh , we are little caesar fans here 
that's where we always go , 
but it's just a lot cheaper than domino's , 
so that's . 
we go to grandy's quite a bit i would say . 
we like grandy's , too . 
mcdonald's , uh , we've sort of been off of that for a while 
and no particular reason , 
and i , 
maybe we avoided wendy's the last few years because our daughter worked there 
and she never wanted us to show up there 
 so , we don't go there that much . 
where do you go if you like to have a nice meal out , or a big meal ? 
a nice meal , oh , 
where do you go for steaks ? 
it's usually when we're out of town 
 and i'll order steak or steak and lobster combined 
 so it's really not in town . 
you ever been to houston's on belt line ? 
that's where we go to get steaks 
they have a teriyaki steak there , 
and when we have something to celebrate , we head to houston's . 
they don't take reservations , 
and you wind up waiting about an hour 
 but the food is good , 
and they've got a nice patio area that you can wait and get something to drink , unless you get there at five o'clock , 
then you can go right through . 
but they have real good signature salads there and nice steaks , 
so , that's our nice place to go . 
we don't usually take the kids when we go there , 
but well , we don't go out that much , 
well , i guess we do go out without kids . 
we're usually picking things up quickly , 
and , uh , with my husband traveling he can get all he needs 
that's right . 
 so , it doesn't really matter to him . 
he'd probably just like to stay home . 
that's the way with my husband . 
he's gone during the week and likes to eat at home on the weekends , 
and i've been eating at home all week long with the kids and would like to go out somewhere , 
so we have a conflict of interests on the weekend . 
but i think it all began eating out when we had , uh , the boys in different , uh , baseball 
it was mainly baseball teams 
 and my husband would coach , 
so we were never home at the same time . 
i'm not one that's going to fix , you know , the meal at two o'clock in the afternoon so they can eat it all day whenever 
or you know 
you go somewhere else . 
well , the types of vacations that i usually take , 
i usually come back more tired after my vacation ,
um , i need to definitely take a vacation where all i do is rest . 
and i guess to do that i'd probably have to take it at home . 
but , um , the vacation spots that i like to go to are places like the bahamas and florida . 
i enjoy the beach . 
oh , after our last summer's vacation i am antibeach . 
antibeach . 
we went to , uh , cape hatteras . 
well , we were out visiting one of our kids in maryland , 
and we went down to cape hatteras for a few days . 
and , uh , uh , the waves were huge . 
i've never quite seen waves like this one 
 and , uh , i was standing in water not more than , barely above my ankles 
 and , uh , you know when the waves go in the waves go out they kind of all of a sudden you're in sand above your ankles . 
and i was standing there talking to my daughter 
and this really big wave came and totally threw me , 
and one foot did not come out of the sand , 
and it tore the ligaments in my knee .
so i'm never going to another beach again , ever . 
i'm ma , 
 you might be like i am . 
i enjoy going to the beach and to beach areas , 
but i really don't like to get in the ocean . 
i prefer a swimming pool .
well , i love to go and play around . 
at least i always did i like the mountains . 
that's my biggest gripe about living here . 
and i basically , .
i can understand that . 
my dream vacation is alaska . 
this is 
that would be nice . 
and someday i hope we can afford to just take a humdinger of a vacation up there . 
i know i've taken several vacations to colorado , 
and i used to live in colorado , oh , sometime ago for a couple of years , 
and i really enjoyed that . 
i'd like that . 
uh , i haven't been to yellowstone for a long , long time 
 and uh , we've been talking about going there next summer .
uh , i don't know we'll have to , 
i've never been up to the yellowstone area . 
it's been a long time . 
but you know , it seems when your family is different places , a lot of trips involved .
that's right . 
you got that . 
oh , i'm , 
we usually go up to wisconsin at least once a year 
and my mother and his mother live up there feeling 
and , uh , we've got one of our kids lives out on the east coast 
and so we have to , you know , go to those . 
well , you have a lot of vacation areas you can go to then . 
well , i know 
but i'm tired of them .
i want up there . 
that's right . 
and , uh , um , you know , that's what i would like to do . 
i have no interest , for example , in taking a cruise . 
to me why somebody would want to ride around on a boat for a few days is mind boggling . 
it would be sort of , 
i feel like it would be confining . 
you know i would much rather get on a plane and get there 
i just , uh , 
that does absolutely nothing for me . 
 but , uh , i don't know 
i can say that i think and wildlife to view 
and , uh , i like that kind of stuff . 
i could just sit there all day and look at the scenery .
i agree . 
i can do that too , 
and , uh , you know , i think if i had the money , i would probably go to europe every year . 
because , you know , i think that they have it all over there in just a few tiny ,
you know , there's mountains 
and there's beaches 
and it's all right there . 
uh , i guess i've never really thought about it that way . 
our , uh , 
we have a daughter who's almost thirteen 
but she's , uh 
i would like to go to africa . 
oh , yes . 
this is great . 
well , we're from colorado 
so we're bronco fans .
and , um , we just moved here two years ago 
and they went to the superbowl when we first moved here 
and they lost again . 
that was pretty pitiful , 
but they seem to be doing pretty good this year . 
well , i was from illinois originally , 
and i grew up a bear fan . 
and , uh , then we moved here 
even when we knew we were being transferred here we became cowboy fans . 
and we had some wonderful , wonderful years there under roger  staubach  .
and we kind of got spoiled . 
we expected it to continue forever . 
i think they're doing pretty well this year though . 
well , have they just lost one game this year ? 
i know they lost , yeah , to washington and philadelphia . 
but they're not doing bad . 
people are pretty surprised that i mean they beat the giants . 
and wasn't that fun . 
i went to the balloon festival in plano and carried my little portable radio with me , 
and i must say i attracted a lot of attention . 
i bet .
oh , boy , i bet all the men that got direct down there were just right on it .
you know , but i wasn't , 
i had forgotten 
or i probably wouldn't have been there . 
well , i'm a big football fan . 
i never wou , 
my father was a football fan my whole life 
and he used to have the football pool at the office and all this stuff 
and i just hated it . 
and i think i was just mad because he spent so much time watching football on sundays . 
uh , so when i met my husband , he was watching football 
and i figured out that i couldn't see him all weekend . 
i couldn't see him until like tuesday because monday night football , if i didn't ,
that's exactly where both of the wives came from i think . 
it was , uh , you know , 
it's easier to join them than fight them . 
and if you want to see them , you might just as well enjoy football . 
well , i do . 
i love it . 
 i just think it's such a fun sport . 
and , uh , i'm just hoping that the broncos can get back on their feet . 
we're not convinced that we're going to be cowboy fans yet . 
but , uh , 
well , it takes a little brainwashing first . 
that's even harder . 
are you , uh , transit usually ? 
i mean do you stay not in one place too long ? 
we're just , 
we've only been married for five and a half years . 
and , uh , we have two small children , 
and he uh , just got transferred here to esystems , 
well , it will take you a little while 
but you'll probably always have a soft spot in your heart though 
well , i tell you this , 
the weather here and there's no mountains or anything , you know , 
and when you go to a football game in colorado you know , there's snow 
and it's an adventure .
and here , yeah 
oh , i know . 
and , uh , 
well , if they close it in , see , we'll have the best of both worlds then 
but , uh , dan reeves is a pretty neat guy anyway . 
well , he's from here . 
that's right , you know 
he was one of our boys . 
that's what i hear . 
so we never cheer against denver unless they're playing the cowboys . 
which is rare . 
which is good . 
but , uh , i , 
you know , it's funny 
in colorado when the broncos went to the superbowl three times in the last , i don't know , five or six years whatever it's been . um , they have these songs on the radio . 
they take and change them to fit , uh , the broncos and stuff . 
and they had , 
i was just thinking about one the other day . 
uh , if i saw a picture of john elway in the cafeteria at school , um , 
but they did the johnny angel . 
they did johnny elway to that . 
johnny elway . 
and i was trying to get my son to sing that . 
but , they do a lot of fun things . 
i think a sport that i think you kind of , it's hard not to like it . 
because you know there's just , 
well , there is so much about it 
it's exciting . 
you know 
and when the cowboys won the superbowl here , of course , they put together some real cute songs , 
and we all ran out and bought the records , 
and now we feel like they're kind of a collector's item . 
they probabl , 
in colorado . 
because , uh , i think about that a lot . 
but , you know , when i first moved here well , no , i guess it was about a year ago they did this . 
this interstate seventyfive song .
that was kind of a funny song 
but they sure do , 
it seems to me like they really love their cowboys here . 
even when they were losing pitifully , you know , people still support them . 
we drive by some houses everyday that have big signs , 
we love the cowbo , 
are we paying too much in taxes , 
and are we getting what we pay for ? 
what's your opinion ? 
well , it's kind of a broad subject , uh , 
but federal government , uh , where we're short changed . uh , lot of money spent for , uh , things that are not used 
and , uh , i was in the air force 
and there was equipment at every base i was ever on that was just going to waste . 
it was just sitting and rusting 
you know , and  , 
i tend to agree with you . 
when it comes to government spending , there are so many studies done that don't mean anything 
 but we'll spend hundreds of thousands , if not millions , of dollars on . 
and it's nice to know something doesn't work or something doesn't exist , 
but , it could be put to more practical use . 
and a tone of our times that politicians , uh , are into themselves more than they are into , you know , doing something worthwhile for the people they represent , which is really unfortunate . 
that is true . 
i agree with you in that area . 
uh , i have a tendency to , 
i'm from texas 
and i read , you know , how our politicians voted each week in the paper . 
and you know , it's interesting how the votes vary 
and what they ran on in platform 
and don't really respond to , uh , people who write them and call them 
and , uh , you know , unless they're in the limelight and under pressure .
i think we get short changed on that . 
that's very true . 
what state do you live in ? 
what do you think about robin hood ? 
well  , i work for school district 
and , uh , it has hurt us a lot . 
uh , there has to be some way , i think , to equalize education opportunities . 
but , uh , you know , especially big government , tends to think that the solution to everything is to throw money at it . 
and i don't , you know , 
that's just not true . 
you know , i don't think money is going to take the place of intelligence or , uh , problem solving skills . 
uh , i think that are important as far as education is concerned . 
that's true . 
what school district do you work for ? 
i work for plano . 
so , we're comparable . 
as a matter of fact , i just paid my richardson taxes because i live in richardson and supplemented the robin hoods very thoroughly , i think . 
i think we've , uh , 
our taxes went up tremendously . 
and it's not going to get any better . 
 you know , i mean , it's going up and up and up . 
uh , i used to live in the plano school district , 
and , uh , there was i think to the people in plano that , you know , we didn't want our taxes raised . 
i remember there was about five years ago . 
but , you know , this , uh , 
i think living in richardson , we're kind of spoiled because i think any city in the country . 
well , did you read in the dallas paper where they increased the administrators' pay by thirty three percent 
is that incredible ? 
that's the biggest mess i've ever heard of . 
you know , you know , if you have to lay people off ? 
but , you know , i'm not going to complain because plano we all got a pay raise this year . 
you all got a pay raise this year . 
is that correct ? 
and i don't know about administrators . 
i'm semiretired 
and i was an administrator , 
so you know , i don't get a raise anymore . 
i just , 
my pay doesn't change . 
are you on the early retirement ? 
oh , are you enjoying it ? 
uh , course , i still work two parttime jobs .
so , it's not really total retirement . 
well , it's interesting , you know , because when you look at what richardson has done with the early retirement you , 
that's a rather broad topic .
they're usually pretty broad anyway . 
where do you live ? 
uh , we live in plano . 
so , that's a , 
uh , and where you are ? 
i'm in richardson , 
that is so frightening . 
it is , you know , 
uh , do you have children in school ? 
at least when they were in high school , it was beginning but not like the rampages . 
well , i have , 
my oldest is his first year in high school 
so we have all this to look forward to , 
and it is really frightening , uh , to think that you can't even send them to school in safety . 
i mean , certainly , you know , you can't just turn them loose in the middle of dallas , 
but , you know , when you can't even , send them on their normal activities in safety , it's really frightening . 
that's true . 
and , uh , i really , you know , 
they're coming down on the principal , 
but i really don't know what they can do . 
i mean , it's just in so much of society with the violence 
and the kids having access to weapons and drugs 
and what can be done . 
well , of course , in my little world , how guns could be so available . 
well  , i don't either , 
but apparently they just really are . 
uh area . 
but , you know , my son comes home and tells me that , you know , he hears kids talk about having guns 
and  , uh , someone came to his football practice about two weeks ago with a gun . 
oh , my heavens . 
and , i mean , it just scared me to death 
and , you know , they called the police 
and nothing happened , 
but my goodness  , you know , it could have easily . 
well , maybe that's the answer to crime is getting more prosecution . 
maybe so . 
you know , because i don't , 
now somehow i feel we're living in an impartial society as far as people seeing something happen , you know , across the street , or seeing someone get mugged , or unfortunately , raped , 
and people don't do anything . 
a woman was raped in richardson , i read in the paper oh , about a two weeks ago now . 
and all the neighbors said they heard her yelling for help . 
oh , no . 
but nobody did anything . 
i just can't imagine that . 
you know , i mean they heard someone calling for help . 
i'm afraid , you know , if you , 
i don't blame people with today's society about going out to help themselves . 
well , i can see , you know , especially if you heard screams from a house or something , not going over there maybe , because , you know , it could be dangerous , 
but certainly i can't understand not calling the police . 
i just , you know , 
we're trying to live in our own little cocoons 
and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention . 
well i think you're right there . 
i guess people just kind of keep their noses pointed in their own business , 
but i think that's real dangerous 
and , uh , i don't know . 
i try to tell my kids just kind of be aware of what's around them , you know 
and get out of it or call for help , whichever . 
but , uh , 
well , you know , the call for help is what scares me now because it just , 
i don't know , 
people just don't , 
i don't know , 
i can't say they don't care , because people just have to care about another person . 
but it's that not getting involved , that impersonal society , i think we live in today . 
 well , maybe this thing to correct it . 
i don't know , 
is frightening . 
i , uh , 
getting back to your son's football practice because it really sort of astonished me that police aren't doing , 
i don't know . 
i mean , i don't know the details . 
this was not a child that was on the team . 
it was someone that , uh , you know , just kind of showed up at the field . 
uh , it was a student age person , 
but i'm not even , 
tell me what you like to do . 
well , well , i'm sort of in an antique business , 
but it's a little 
and , uh , i'm building a log house at a farm that i have in east texas , which is 
it's really neat . 
and , uh , uh , course i've been working on it for five years , 
but , you know , 
oh , but how wonderful . 
are you close to getting it done ? 
 you know , of course there's still a lot of work to be done , 
and then when you get it completely , you know , the shell finished , uh , you still have a lot of stuff to do inside , 
but , uh , 
are you going to move your whole family over there then ? 
i'll probably always have a place here in richardson or dallas .
kind of your getaway place . 
but it's beautiful , 
you know , it's eastern hardwood , uh , forest , 
there are a lot of pine trees , 
but it's mostly oaks 
and   .
oh , how beautiful , 
and it's pretty flat there ? 
but , it's , you know , low hills , 
it's not , uh , 
see , i've only been to texas once . 
i have two sisters in texas now , um , one in austin , one in dallas , 
and the one in dallas is the one that got me to doing this 
 and , uh , i thought austin was beautiful 
i liked the hills 
in aus , 
it's really different because you know , that's the chalk hills down there ,
born and raised texan , huh . 
well , i had never been there , 
that's pretty neat . 
my sisters both seem to like it pretty well . 
my brotherinlaw works for the university , um , in dallas . 
he's admissions director . 
uh . university of texas in dallas . 
oh , okay 
it's just north of me here . 
well he's got a job there 
and this is his first year , 
so , it's been a real interesting thing for them .
that's great . 
but they seem to like it okay . 
i think they're too far away from me , 
well , yeah , 
we'll see . 
pretty good trip . 
so what kind of hobbies are you in ? 
well , i'm mother of four , 
so basically i'm just ,
and we have a little halloween talent show tonight , 
and , i substitute at the schools parttime . 
oh , that's great . 
well , i am a travel agent at heart , 
and my hobby is just , 
i love traveling and being involved of that and finding out more , uh , 
but , it's real hard to work in the summers and holidays and weekends when you have four children and a husband , 
no , kidding . 
so i've been librarian all this week , which has been real interesting , 
and i'm enjoying it . 
i'm around my kids 
it's great , 
it's great , 
and what else do i do , 
i do lots of cross stitching when i have time 
 and i enter things in our little state fair , 
and that's pretty fun . 
that's great . 
well , but , actually my hobbies mostly is my sports . tennis , 
i play tennis . 
ooh , i love tennis too 
do you ? 
 and i ski , 
do you ski ? 
we snow ski at mount bachelor mostly 
uh , that's great . 
have you ever been there ? 
no , uh , 
wonderful place . 
i've skied in colorado 
where in colorado ? 
i've been to telluride which is on the west side 
copper is kind of my favorite up there .
i guess those are the only places i've skied up there . 
i would love , 
i can hardly wait to get 
me , too . 
are you guys getting snow ? 
we're to get one to three inches tonight . 
 oh , gee , 
i heard aspen got three feet . 
oh , yeah , 
well we are on the dry side of the mountains . 
seattle is only about two and a half hours , 
so of course i'm a real seahawks fan 
 and , um , going over that pass is just a real nightmare . 
i can imagine , my lord . 
and we're on the colder side , 
they're on the rainy side , 
we're on the snowy side 
and , um , we ski . 
my children all ski 
oh , super . 
 and we have been to whistler in canada , which is just a marvelous place , 
whistler and black home is in canada , 
and then we've gone to sun valley several times , 
that's not in colorado 
since i went to school , 
what about utah ? 
haven't been there , 
i keep hearing these marvelous things 
haven't either . 
um , um 
always want to go to 
ooh , yes . 
and your kids all ski ? 
my kids are all grown . 
but my youngest son is a skier . 
that's great . 
well , my boys are at the point where they scare their mommy to death . 
when they're skiing they're fearless , 
and they go off , 
when they first said the subject , my mind went kind of blank . 
well , i haven't either , uh , 
i hate returning things . 
i mean , i have a friend who , if she likes something , isn't sure what size somebody might need , will buy it in every color and size and , you know , take everything back again .
you know , it's a game to her , 
but i do not like to do that .
i consider it kind of a waste of my time . 
and so i'm usually , uh , pretty careful when i shop 
 and i also , you know , usually have checked over things , you know , if it's like an appliance or something to make sure , uh , it has the features in it that i want . 
dustbuster plus 
and we've had it for a while , 
but all of a sudden it just wasn't working , 
and it looks like there's a part missing from it . 
my husband opened it up and whatever , 
and of course we don't have the receipt any more , 
so we can't take it back .
of course , 
uh , but , i think a lot of goods are made not to last real long 
just to get you by five years 
and then you'll throw it away rather than have it fixed 
we're a wasteful society , for sure . 
well , that's true , 
and lot of times though , it costs so much to get something fixed 
and you usually get what you pay for . 
we bought some walkietalkies a couple of years ago for christmas , 
and they were like ten dollars , 
and we expected them to work nice for the little kids , 
and they didn't work 
so we took those back , 
and that's about that 
all that were taken back in ages . 
well , yeah , 
i think a lot of times , if you get a brand name 
there can be a lemon in anything 
you pretty well know what you're getting ahead of time , 
and , uh 
i mean , we had a car once that we tried to have declared a lemon under the lemon law 
oh , really . 
it's hard . 
we never could get it declared a lemon , 
and the car would go 
and , without any warning whatsoever , you could be going down the freeway at sixty 
and it would stop 
oh , wow . 
 and i , 
there was just , 
you know , and , oh , we went round and round with the manufacturer and everything , 
and they got it finally semifixed , 
but it was such a hassle 
and it just pertained to that .
but , gee , of all the topics i have had , i'm doing this thing , this is kind of the strangest one . 
 mainly what i buy , 
it seems like , 
and , uh , you know , i still don't have anything to do there , 
well , i think that's true , 
and uh , now we generally don't buy a warranty , because you think , you know , at least for the first couple of years , nothing should go wrong with it . 
my husband is really good at fixing things , too , 
so he usually , be able to fix anything that's minor , 
 but , it was interesting to , 
i don't know if they're making them better or not , 
it's hard to say . 
i think they more of their parts plastic , which , you know , makes things break easier , 
but i think the technology is better . 
i'm not sure . 
i think 
about quality . 
i don't think necessarily that , things are being made better 
everything is so automated , uh , 
and things can be made without , i think 
and i think that certainly makes a difference back from the time when somebody handcrafted something and , you know , had some pride in it . 
well , people aren't willing to pay those prices very often , so , you know , for a handcrafted something , 
well , yeah , 
so , if we get .
well , i do , uh , you know , craft work and sell stuff at shows 
it's a real eyeopener as far as , you know , why people charge what they do to , you know . 
well , you keep up with current events ? 
not as well as i would like to probably 
is that right ? 
 but that's the way it goes . 
whereabouts in pennsylvania . 
where in pennsylvania ? 
um , state college , 
i go to penn state . 
oh , do you , 
well , great . 
how's , uh , 
well no , 
we're not supposed to talk about that . 
we're supposed to talk about current events . 
exactly , uh . 
well , i'm a current event junkie . 
so i try to watch the news , 
and i read the newspaper , 
and i like to read time magazine and people magazine to keep up with what's going on in the world . 
i see . 
well , what particularly are you interested in ? 
well , i just , pretty , uh , little , you know , about everything . 
and , not 
but you know , i like to know pretty well what's happening . 
political things don't interest me a great deal , except i do like to stay informed enough to , feel like i halfway vote intelligently , you know 
 but , uh , other than that , uh , i just , you know , 
just the events that happen around the world interest me .
now i have to say all three of my children , none of them are too interested in current events . 
i see . 
but i always have been 
 and i stay up with it . 
but , uh , how do you , uh , stay aware of most of the current events . uh , newspaper ?
i read the newspapers sometimes 
 and i watch c n n , that sort of thing 
that's good . 
 and i read magazines , and such . 
well , you stay up with it pretty well , then . 
well , yeah , 
i mean , not that badly 
so i am interested in what's going on , 
and i'm particularly interested in certain things of course , like all the news about haiti recently 
oh , you've been there 
 and , yeah . 
 well , you would be interested in it then . 
yeah , uh , 
i follow it , you know , 
i don't just read everything about it , 
but i'm always aware of what's going on like that 
it's interesting 
 and , uh , i don't know , 
i feel sorry for those people down there , 
they've just been so terribly mistreated for so many years , you know . 
that's true . 
they've never really had a good leader , 
i mean he was 
 and i think it's been better since he died , 
but it's still been bad 
 but , uh , even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew , uh , 
i've read some things about him that he wasn't too good himself . 
oh , yeah ? 
he was pretty much a , 
he didn't mind having people bumped off for certain things , you know . 
but , uh , 
i see . 
uh , but then again , who , you know , 
those people are so used to it 
i guess it's the only thing that works . 
so what do you think about the quality of news coverage in america ? 
i think it's pretty darned good , 
i think we're lucky to have as good a coverage as we have 
i really do . 
now , and go a little to the extreme , 
the media does , 
more than once a day , i mean , it's the same thing over and over and over and over , 
and i listen to the radio 
 so you hear so much , 
you get a little tired of it , 
but then again , so many people you got to understand only catch it once a day , maybe 
 but i think the quality of uh , our news is just , uh , i don't believe it could be better 
i really don't . 
well , you know , i think it always could be better , 
but i ,
i don't think so . 
i don't think our news could be better . 
i mean , i mean , what else could they do to make it better . 
i don't see anything that they could do . 
well , i think that , um , 
i don't know . 
well , you always 
the , um , 
i understand what you're saying , 
i think that , 
but by trial and error over the years , i think they got it about as good as they're going to get it . 
well , that may be so , 
i think that 
well , that's true , 
i understand what you're saying , 
and then again , i understand why they can't dig too much deeper , 
that's why we have c n n . 
c n n has the time , since that's all they do is news 
 uh , well , i guess it's a subject i haven't thought too much about . 
uh , i don't know if there's so much wrong with the public schools , uh , as much as ,
uh , that might be a lot to do with it . 
i know a lot of it here in my state , 
i'm from mississippi , 
i'm not sure where you're from . 
minnesota , wisconsin . 
well a lot of it in mississippi here has got to do with funding . 
problems with our educational system , a lot of it's due to money . 
and they're trying to spend money where we don't have it 
and there's a lot of things we need that we just can't afford . 
well , it is getting very expensive to run schools , 
well it is . 
they've got computers now that you got to train on . 
there's just 
that's true . 
and a lot of it has to do with , uh , salaries too , speaking 
cause if you can't pay the right people , you know , not going to get the people that can do a good job . 
i guess that in , uh , 
talking on a lot of the things as far as the discipline in the schools , i think they're expecting schools to discipline the kids 
and , uh , i think it should go right back to the parents .
i feel the same way . 
a lot has to do with how the kids were raised at home . 
and then when the kids get to school , they try to take away a lot of things that they can do to discipline the kids . 
i mean , they've so severely limited 
what disciplinary action you can do . 
i know when i , uh , was going to school it wasn't uncommon for a teacher to strike a student that was misbehaving . 
i mean they do that now 
and they could probably lose their job .
lose their job and big lawsuit and all that . 
i feel that's got a lot to do with it . 
people aren't as afraid of misbehaving as they used to be . 
it seems  that'd  be a subject that i don't have much to say on .
we've talked some about it in my state because we've had a lot of , uh , prob , 
our governor that just got thrown out of office was trying to be real big on education 
but he wasn't . 
and a lot of his problems had to do with money mostly . 
i know a lot of , 
if you have more money it's just logical that you can provide a better school system . 
and , unfortunately , there's not many places to get that money . 
then if you don't have qualified teachers in the different    , 
i know one of my physics professors at college has addressed this . 
that most of the teachers at the elementary and high school level aren't scientists , 
they're teachers . 
and they may not know a lot about what they're teaching . 
where they may have just had a teaching major and then had some social studies courses 
and they're trying to teach social studies . 
and they don't know a lot about that .
where maybe a physics professor , 
my professor was a physics professor 
and he said a lot of teachers teaching physics today have no background of physics at the high school level . 
so therefore , they're teaching from a teacher's point of view and not from a physicist point of view . 
and that causes a lot of trouble . 
i don't know , 
and kind of , uh , decide on where the money's best spent . 
i know in a lot of cases , uh , different districts like to have nice fancy schools . 
and maybe they should be a little more , uh , uh , concerned with paying the right people to teach and be , uh , satisfied with maybe a little older school . 
because , i mean , here in the town i went to high school , 
there were four high schools in my county , one of the high schools was blown away by a tornado . 
so when they rebuilt that school , they had a top of the line , high tech school there . 
and the other schools were built back in maybe the fifties or early sixties 
and then when , uh , the evaluation committees came through , they praised the school that had been rebuilt while they were down grading all these other ones . telling them what they needed to do to fix up this building 
and so it kind of would make you think that we'd all be better off if all the schools were blown away by tornadoes and we had to rebuild them . 
well i know , uh , where i came from . we didn't have a very , uh , rich community 
and , uh , high school that i went to was very old 
and , uh , as far as i know , it's still there . 
they've expanded on it 
but they've never built a new one 
and it's probably fifty , sixty years old or better 
uh , so what do you think about the school system ? 
well , i think they're having a lot of trouble right now . 
i know my son goes to a private school , 
but , uh , i think and everything else going on . 
uh , why did you choose a private school ? 
well , i had one that was needed to be able to be moved along at a pace a little faster than he was going to be able to be moved in public school , 
public school . 
oh , has he ? 
then how does he like it ? 
oh , he's loved it . 
he is a senior in high school this year 
so 
and uh , it's been really good for him . 
how big of a school is it ? 
uh , overall on campus about twelve hundred , but in the upper four grades , uh , about four hundred and something 
so it's maybe a hundred per grade . 
a hundred per grade , that's a good size . 
it really is . 
kind of gives them the , you know , 
i get a little leery of the real small ones that they don't get much interaction with kids 
but , uh , 
we were kind of looking for one that would be a mixture 
 so they don't , 
that's good . 
and he was just ahead at an early age 
and i didn't feel like , uh , what was available , particularly in the first three grades 
 and even in the fourth grade where they started what they called reach was still a pull out one day program . 
and i just didn't think that was going get it . 
i thought he needed to be exposed to a situation where he could push ahead , uh , every day .
still enjoy the , 
uh , one thing i think i've noticed is , uh , my oldest is in kindergarten , 
so i'm in a little different 
you're just 
i'm just ,
but , uh , seems to me that , uh , kids these days , uh , can really get away with murder 
and the teachers aren't respected as much 
and , uh , they have to be so careful of the things they do and say . 
i know . 
and , uh , makes me 
we wouldn't have thought of crossing a teacher when we 
wouldn't have thought of it 
you wouldn't . 
and , uh , the things they can say and do to a teacher they do from what i understand , uh , 
i think that's wrong . 
i think we need to get back to show some respect 
and , course , i guess the teacher used to warrant that 
but a lot of times it's not being taught in the home 
for other people 
and so then you wind up with little brats on your hands . 
well , how do you think that that's happened ? 
you think our society's just , uh , stopped talking out , 
or this , uh 
i guess , i , 
well , the world changes , 
so i mean , obviously , kids are not the same now as they used to be . 
i mean they're exposed to a whole lot more things . 
they have a whole lot more , uh , variety of things that they see and do at an earlier age , 
so life is not maybe as simple as it was at one time , 
uh , ness of authority . 
and i just don't think that this 
that just isn't coming through 
i mean , i remember , uh , well , it was a big thing when they let girls wear levi's . 
we used to have to wear 
 and then you had to , go to dresses , 
they had to be a pantsuit 
and it was polyester 
and it had to be matching 
and when it was skirts , it was like , get down on the floor 
and we hold the ruler up here 
 and it's no 
because it was mini skirt time back there at one time . 
so it's really changed . 
it's , uh , really kind of gone the rounds , 
so i think that maybe that's effected it to some degree . 
they say you kind of act how you're dressed a little bit , 
so i , 
i think that probably does have something to do with it , 
and it's also , 
require to wear a uniform 
there are quite a few of your s , 
well , considering you moved here from california , i guess , the rain for the past few weeks has been different than what you have down there . 
we have , uh , in california , 
we have rain couple times a year 
and other than that , you know , it would be maybe october and then in the spring 
and then other than that there wouldn't be any rain .
so here , i know that , uh , last year there was some ice storms while i was out of the state 
and i'm glad to see there haven't been any this year . 
still could come , 
generally if we're going to get them , it's not going to happen , uh , prior to january one . 
you may get a cold snap or two or some rain or something like we've been getting in december , 
then by march things are getting warm again , 
so we really don't have , as long a cold season , i guess as people up north . 
it's so hard to predict here . 
it's been eighty degrees on christmas day here before . 
 lots of times . 
 well , today it's not bad out there . 
it's nice . 
i just came in from outside 
 and it's really pretty . 
it's kind of nice to have it dry all the ground out 
i'm a scoutmaster 
and so i wind up going out camping with , uh , a bunch of boys at one time 
and so , it's 
oh , yeah . 
we camp year round . 
yeah , oh , 
but , uh , 
and they're not too pleasant .
it gets so humid . 
to me it's humid here . 
people that i know that 
oh , it is . 
it's not as 
but i find it , 
and california for the most part . 
were you northern california ? 
central valley . 
it's very dry there . 
well , it's pretty hot in the summer . 
it's in the usually , you know , 
for a good three , four weeks we have over a hundred degrees . 
but it's a drier , 
but it's a dry heat , yeah . 
i know . well , i lived in africa for a couple years in 
and that's a tropical climate 
and it really feels similar to this 
what types of , 
or was that just vacation or something ? 
it's an organization where we are looking to translate the bible into languages of the world that aren't yet written . 
not so much still trying to translate old texts as just trying to translate modern versions into other languages . 
languages that don't have anything written yet . 
so this is like the first thing that's written down 
and then , uh , 
that's interesting . 
you don't think about that as a normal career , uh , when 
well , it's based here , 
uh , the international headquarters for wycliff bible translators is right here in dallas . 
so you're with the home office now .
right now i am . 
that's what brought me here , 
well , uh , i think , uh , all in all there are a lot worse climates than dallas , uh , 
the weather 
and things do happen severely a few times a year , 
but there's an awful lot of good weather , too , in 
i agree , 
i thought the fall was really nice . 
and usually a lot of the spring months are really nice , too .
 and when it begins to be in the sixties and seventies most of the time , uh , i 
and that's 
you probably do a lot of that with 
think we're going in just a couple of weeks out to east texas , 
and it is a little more humid out there than it is here , 
the only thing you have to watch out in this part of the country is during the change type seasons is the really severe storms that occasionally 
there's not much between us and the north pole .
and then when you get one of those tornado type 
and then , 
uh , do you live in a home ? 
it's a house we bought , uh , about two and a half years ago now . 
oh , did you ? 
uhhuh . 
first house . 
we've lived in ours for about six years . 
we had it built , actually . 
and , uh , uh , it's our first home , too . 
so what do you think to renting somebody else's ? 
um , well before we built our home we were managing some apartments that 
and , um , that was quite an experience .
and more privacy . 
is it a fairly large house ? 
um , uh , uh , it's like twentyfour fifty square feet . 
oh , that's pretty good size . 
it's a two story . 
how about yours ? 
it's tiny . 
is it small ? 
actually we had an two bedroom apartment that was about as big as this house is . 
oh , really . 
oh , uhhuh . 
do you have children ? 
just one . 
just one . 
but , uh , all the rooms are small , i mean , 
but it ends up giving us three bedrooms , which we wanted . and , uh . use an extra one for an office 
oh , uhhuh . 
i'd rather lots of space , 
but , uh , that ends up costing me . 
oh yeah , 
well , like , um , how does it compare to the ones in your neighborhood ? .
well , i mean , it's a very , very middle class neighborhood . 
uh , lots of young couples with , you know , usu , oh , 
i'm sure that virtually everybody in the neighborhood , that's their first homes 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , uh , lots of kids and stuff , 
and , so it fits well , in the neighborhood . 
it's certainly not a real upscale neighborhood , 
but on the other hand , it's clean and kind of suburban 
is yours also 
 or is it ? 
but our neighborhood has of , um , people , 
and , you know , there's older people here , our age , 
we're in our thirties . 
and , um , there's a lot of kids . 
  people across the street have eight . 
wow , eight kids ? 
oh , my gosh . 
their home just burned down 
and they're just rebuilding 
and , um , their house is going to be really big .
i'm sure , with eight , 
they're building a lot bigger . 
he's , uh , um , uh , oh , not an obstetrician , an orthopedic surgeon . 
they're going , 
it's quite different than it was before , 
and it's 
um , but ours is about , 
you know , it's a nice home , 
it's definitely not one of the smaller ones , 
and , um , it's not the biggest either . 
new ones , i mean , uh , especially in newer neighborhoods , 
my brother just built a new house . 
he lives in wichita , kansas , 
and um , the neighborhood actually fought him on it , 
because um , the house was going to cost less to build than any other house in the neighborhood . 
now , that's because he's doing a lot of it himself 
and his house actually ended up being nicer than lots   in the neighborhood , 
he was a little surprised . 
you know , that's interesting 
you say that , because we have those architectural codes here 
 and when we , um , put out house in , um , they wanted us to have , 
there was one , 
we have part siding 
and , there was one side where our chimney was , 
and just the chimney was going to be brick , 
and they wanted us to have more brick , 
so we ended up having to go halfway up 
it does look nicer , 
and , you know , we would have like to have had all brick , 
but , of course at that point we couldn't afford it , 
but , it's funny that you'd say that , because there were homes in here that didn't have any brick at all . 
so it's kind of like , they were . 
kind of depends on when they get in , you know . 
and so it was kind of like it's they , 
ours is the last street that they built on . 
so the houses actually on our street they're kind of gone a little bit nicer . 
oh , they have , 
it's gotten , 
yeah , 
i mean , just 
it's like the second phase 
the codes a little bit , 
and so that's kind of why , i guess , they stuck us with more brick when there were 
well , see , my sister kind of got in the opposite end of that , because a real nice stone house down in south austin . 
oh , uhhuh . 
they do phase one , 
and they kind of give it a very upscale and very tightly controlled , uh , codes and stuff , 
and then they come back in , 
and then they sell , 
i , uh , spent four years as a university professor . 
i spent three years , 
i'm teaching in public schools and elementary school . 
oh , do you really ? 
that's great . 
i taught in utah , 
and , uh , 
no kidding . 
you sound pretty young for a university professor .
well , i was pretty young . 
i was , uh , 
i had never intended to do it 
and i was , uh , uh , given the opportunity after i'd started a management consulting firm to teach in , uh , uh , one of the business schools in the california state university system . 
at any rate , uh , the topic is fascinating because one of the things i've done for the past few years is , uh , research the problem from the point of view of , uh , uh , what appears to be working best and how you can explain it theoretically . 
you may be familiar with cooperative learning . 
have you ever , 
 well you can tell me a little bit more about it because i don't think we did that in utah . 
well , the cooperative learning is a technique that was tried initially to integrate the public schools . 
and , uh , what it involves , basically , is the use of peer groups 
and the , uh , teacher becomes resource person 
and there are , uh , some fairly sophisticated approaches that are used in the high schools with point systems and things like that so that people , uh , gain a competence with respect to the material . 
uh , i think that the combination of , uh , technology and techniques like that together with marketplace forces will bring about a revolution in the way we learn . 
uh , i think there is a direct threat to vested interest in the public school system , uh , that will stand in the way of that progress being a little faster . 
uh , school systems are , in too many states , dominated by administrators 
 and , uh , both teachers and parents , uh , complain about uh , uh , the cost and ineffectiveness that results . 
so my feeling is that , uh , is , uh , significant . 
there are plenty of good people , uh , available to , uh , offer people educational experience , 
but that we just have to reallocate and reorganize the resources to do it 
and , uh , i think certain techniques and technologies will influence all of that as well as research , uh , uh , of the sort that people like me do looking at theories of behavior and how they can be used to improve performance , particularly , uh , accelerate the pace of learning . 
and , my feeling is that , uh , those kinds of things will solve the problem eventually . 
i don't know what form it will ultimately take . 
uh , uh , but , i think that the future is pretty bright because people recognize that we're paying an enormous price for , uh , inferior quality when the people involved really aren't inferior , 
so it must be the way we're managing the process that , uh , 
i see what year saying , 
i totally agree . 
both as , quote , unquote students and as teachers , 
but clearly what's happened in this country is the school system's been asked to assume a great many responsibilities 
oh , yeah . 
you must see kids with real significant problems , uh , in some cases . 
uh , course , i always see the , 
i don't know how hard is it , uh , in the public school system in iowa city ? 
is it , uh , deteriorated a lot . 
do the people say , 
are they pretty happy with it , 
well , i haven't taught in iowa , 
but i've taught in utah , 
and , uh , people there were saying that the way that the schools were going , a lot of people were going away and going to private schools , or else going to home , where they taught their kids at home .
even in utah . 
well , utah's a place where you wouldn't think that problem would be very severe . 
but a lot of schools had a lot of transient , uh , families and a lot of families who were on the poorer side 
so , you saw a fair number of troubled kids . 
i mean , like you said , how the schools are doing more things for the kids , they thought , than they were thirty years ago . 
i mean , or 
as well as hot lunch 
well , as far as i'm concerned it's probably apt that your call's at this time because we just got through watching , uh , reasonable doubts .
and , uh , i personally have , uh , 
my own feelings about , uh , capital punishment is i think it should be mandatory upon a third conviction felony . 
i do , too . 
mandatory , i mean , summary execution , on the steps , that day . 
well , i think , you know , i'm in that same , 
i think if it's a convicted , uh , felon on parole 
is beyond , uh , rehabilitation 
and he should be taken out .
well , i also firmly believe that no one is beyond reclamation . 
but , i do know that almost all people usually die before that point . 
they just get too old . 
uh , as far as capital punishment , on it's own merits , i have the trouble with the way it's applied . 
i think it should be applied , on a little bit more fair manner . 
uh , and i've said this very often 
and i believe it to be a very true axiom , 
kill you . 
and if you're black and you kill a black guy , you know , it's , you know , two hundred hours of community service . 
of those cases . 
well , it's a social 
we're the majority , 
so we can do whatever the hell we want to do . 
that's right . 
and you're the minority 
and you're stuck with it . 
 but , uh , you know , we had this in the vietnam war , you know , 
we had  , you know , 
population of blacks among military people in vietnam was about eighty percent . 
but the population of blacks in the military was about twentytwo percent . 
you know , but that's another issue altogether . 
as far as capital punishment , i think that , uh , ten years on death row is cruel and unusual punishment . 
i think the guy should have ninety days 
and if he can't produce evidence 
see , the only thing i don't understand our judicial system , uh , as it is right now 
because execution ? 
i mean , how , you know , is 
a colony of england . 
well , uh , that had a problem with that .
uh , or he'll have somebody lie for him . 
you know , people lie , 
it's a 
but they do that , 
and to prevent that kind of misuse of power , they wrote into the constitution a protection 
and the judicial mishap in this event would be , hey , you got the wrong guy . 
look at that guy , uh , at e systems . 
they convicted him of a robbery that he could not physically have been able to commit . 
he was too far away when it happened . 
he had witnesses an establishment that had a very high level of security sense , too . and these were really responsible people . 
they all look the same to me , you know . 
big lips , flat nose , yep , that was him . 
what do you think about , uh , uh , convicted , uh , 
well , this is an unusual topic . 
what do you think about it ? 
at first i , 
it took eight times to find you 
so i told my husband , uh , you know , 
what should i say 
and then he reminded me , 
but , uh , uh , where to meet and , you know , just , to bring anything , 
and so they just notify everyone by mail , 
and then they just meet at , like , a park or something to have like uh , or a small , uh , dinner type thing . 
well , that sounds great , ellen . 
how far away do they come from ? 
uh , well , they all meet in portland 
and they come as far as , oh , seattle 
and sometimes we've gone 
and we were living in utah at the time . 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , his dad's family is all around the area 
and his mom's side of the family , they all , uh , have their family reunions in southern utah 
and people would come from seattle to there uh , let's see , nevada and in that area , washington and nevada to southern utah 
and each time they had a reunion they'd assign a different person to be in charge of notifying everybody . 
oh , okay , 
that makes sense . 
nobody's out of a lot of trouble more than once . 
and the people who are down there , like , they'll assign one person in the utah area , one person in the washington area 
and that person can call , you know , beforehand and just make sure everyone knows , too . 
and then they just sort of do like a little program or , you know , something like that so 
that's interesting . 
you sound like you've had a lot of experience with this , then . 
oh , well , that's my husband's side and or my family , uh , 
we all live in southern california 
so we just have to either or ,
and we're all there 
southern california's still pretty large . 
well , i mean l a , orange county area . 
i mean 
i see . 
well , my experience , uh , has been limited pretty much lately to my mother's side of the family . 
uh , years ago there was a big dispute on my dad's side 
and , uh , they haven't had a reunion since then . 
they just show up at funerals and weddings . 
it was pretty serious and lot of yelling 
but , anyway , my mother's side we had our first real reunion that i've ever gone to last summer 
and they had people come in from out of town 
and they took some rooms down at a holiday inn 
and , uh , they had some activity , 
they had a nice dinner planned and all of that stuff 
and people got up and talked about various parts of the family tree 
and , you know , a lot of that sort of thing . 
since it was the first one that we'd had you could do that once . 
now next time we have one , 
we'll have to think of something more creative to do . 
well , you know , that's interesting because one thing that always brings to my , uh , husband's mother's side together is , uh , they talk about the genealogy of the family tree every time 
and , uh , inevitably everyone is just very interested 
 and they always have , you know , two or three new ones to add to the list , you know , someone's been born or 
and so everyone has to update their little 
well , have 
not a 
 uh , i suspect we'll do quite a bit more genealogy 
and i suspect we will do more of it . 
uh , i found i didn't even know their names , some of the 
and , uh , there's a lot of things there you have to stop , 
they're really kind of fascinating . 
i found out my grandmother was one of a twin . 
and we don't even know where the twin , 
we have virtually on her 
is it your grandma's own sibling 
and she , 
my grandmother's , uh , sister who would be somewhere in west virginia . 
i'm sure she's , you know , dead now , because my grandmother died about twenty years ago . 
oh , i see . 
oh so , 
i'm probably a lot older than you are . uh , 
well , maybe , uh , they just moved away and then sort of lost contact . 
i don't know . 
um , what type of magazines do you have ? 
we take several at home . 
i take , um , skiing magazine , 
and i take , uh , discover magazine , and also , uh , c d and stereo review 
oh ,   .
oh , good . 
that's a good one , i like to get .
um , so i take it that you like to ski . 
do you , um , receive a lot of information on skiing through the ski magazine ? 
uh , i suppose that puts me on some mailing lists and so forth , because i do get things 
oh , uh , and do you receive discounts and things like that , 
do you think 
some fashions 
so would this vacation you're taking , 
did you receive information from your skiing magazine ? 
uh , we already knew we wanted to take one , 
and we just started looking around . 
i may have referred to a couple of them , 
but we went to the ski show and looked at all of the 
we haven't been there before . 
um , that sounds nice . 
kind of away from the crowd 
but i haven't skied utah yet , 
but i want to . 
oh , well , you need to come out .
i'd like to go to sundance and park city 
i understand deer valley is nice , too . 
deer valley , 
they are , 
it's wonderful snow .
well , how about you , 
what magazines do you have at home ? 
uh , i am currently taking decorative woodworking , and , uh , country living , 
and , let's see , we do have national geographic , 
and then we have some church magazines , 
but i really enjoy the decorative woodworking . 
i'm heavy into woodworking and tole painting and things like that , 
oh , okay . 
does it have , uh , articles on how to do things 
but the whole magazine is just filled with , uh , pictures and projects that you can make yourself , 
and then it has all of the patterns and instructions that you would need to make a wood project , and then how to paint it with the tole paintings , 
and so , it's really a fun one . 
i like that . 
well , that's good . 
it's good to get use out of one . 
i'm not sure that , um , in the case of national geographic , 
i mean , i read it , 
but then they just sort of gather dust for a 
but then eventually there'll be a school project or something where my son will need to refer back through fortyeight back issues to find 
i've noticed that , too , 
but they have been nice to have around . 
every once in a while they come in handy .
i used to take smithsonian 
i liked that magazine 
 but i was , just found myself not ever getting around to reading it . 
oh . uh . 
you get so many coming in , 
and by the time the next round comes in i'm still not through reading the first round . 
oh , that . 
oh , scientific american comes to our house , too , i forgot , 
and that's 
oh , well that sounds like . 
and he takes games magazine 
he likes to try that , 
so . he uh , does get to be a lot of paper though , 
after a while 
they can do that . 
i found that they've been fun for my little girls , 
they're five and four years old , 
and they like to go through 
 oh , yeah , 
they're just kind of getting started now . 
uhhuh . they like to cut the pictures out and paste them on , 
mine is a senior in high school , 
so we're kind of at the end of that trail . 
you're just 
well , i do have a boy in junior high , too , 
oh , okay , 
so you got a little bit of a gap there between , 
 so we're kind of running the gamut .
do you do artistic painting ? 
oh , you do ? 
uh , i haven't done any of the oil or watercolor . 
i would like to learn that someday , 
but right now my passion is tole painting .
do you do a lot of it ? 
and i've done a little , uh , 
but it takes a lot of time .
it does , 
it is real time consuming 
do you sell your projects ? 
uh , i've done , uh , perpetual calendars and cookie jar lids and , oh , on and on , you know , just things like that , 
where do you work at ? 
i just work at stop and shop out there in ogden 
now do you ever send any of your stuff to the boutique ? 
so , i have five children of my own , 
so it's 
that keeps you busy . 
they keep me busy 
and tole painting is just you know , something i do in my spare time 
so  , 
have you tried any of the , 
well , do you cut out your own projects ? 
and so i really enjoy doing that . 
huh . do you , uh , ever spray your projects with i mean a base coat first 
or do you brush it on ? 
i brush it on , 
i haven't tried a spray varnish . 
i use just a wood sealer . 
i just bought a spray gun , one of those high volume , low pressure spray guns . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and i do a lot of woodworking 
do you ? 
but i haven't used it yet . 
now what type of woodworking do you do ? 
uh , fine furniture . 
that's why i bought the sprayer 
that's my worst part of my woodworking . 
i get so sick of making  , 
oh , well , that is interesting . 
so , what kind of equipment do you have ? 
uh , let me see , 
table saw , scroll saw , band saw , lathe , routers , 
and t's about it . 
boy , it sounds like you're really into it . 
that is nice . 
it is . 
i just have a scroll saw and a jig saw 
and i am really anxious to get a band saw and a router .
the band saw is really nice . 
i have an inca . 
i don't know if you've ever heard of those . 
but it's nice to have the right equipment . 
well , have you sold any of your furniture 
mostly i do like you do , give it away as gifts . 
oh , that's interesting . 
uh , did you take classes to learn how to do that ? 
 and then i just kept on through high school and then got my own equipment , kept up with that . 
oh , so yours is mostly just a hobby , too , then . 
well , that is interesting . 
oh , i really would love to go take a class in woodworking and learn how to . 
i don't know if i necessarily want to do furniture , 
but mostly , uh , just 
like 
for your 
so , it's fun .
well  , i guess i'll let you go now . 
well , they come on , 
we're supposed to talk until they come on and 
oh , they do ? 
so this is my first one . 
you're probably a veteran 
 well , it has been really fun . 
i've enjoyed this . uh , 
like i say , i've made a couple of calls to texas , and 
so i think you'll enjoy doing it . 
it's fun . 
sounds fun . 
where do you buy your tole painting paints at around here ? 
uh , you know , there's a shop in roy that i really love . 
uh , and it's there by the , copper mill restaurant , used to be the hayloft . 
i am not famil , 
well , we live in  roy  
 , but , we haven , 
is it on nineteen hundred ? 
uh , let's see , 
i'm trying to think of the name . 
i know where fiftysix hundred south is . 
 uh , i don't right off . 
 is that ben franklin  then   ? 
ben franklin , 
you want to start ? 
i might as well . 
uh , one of the things i'm very concerned about the air pollution , is the ozone layer , uh , uh , issue . 
uh , i used to own a heating and air conditioning business and handled lots of different types of freons , 
and that , uh , rather bothers me that , uh , i was the environment , so to speak . 
that's stuff we never even thought about three years ago . 
and one of the reasons they fixed up the freons eleven , twelve and thirteen , in that area was because they were inexpensive , 
uh , they could be made , uh , you know , inexpensive and lots of it , uh , 
and in that , its properties were great , uh , with , uh , the machinery , didn't have to have lots of expensive machinery to , uh , get your heating and cooling cycles to work . 
have they stopped that practice now ? 
well , course there's excuse me , refrigerators and freezers , both commercial and residential , uh , utilizing freon twelve , 
and of course , the new cars , i guess starting with nineteen ninetythree will not have freon twelve in their systems . 
but , uh , there's , you know , the ton of after market machines , and et cetera , et cetera . 
and that's got me very , you know , highly concerned that , uh , that's going to be quite a while before we can , uh , 
now , that could spawn several good industries and help ,
but you got to have people that can you know , earn a salary to pay for this conversion . 
and come up with a way to , uh , have us as a part of the unemployed society be able to be gainfully employed again converting all this freon twelve stuff into the new nonpolluting , uh , compound . 
oh , yeah . 
because as i say , there's a tremen , 
well , how many , uh , uh , families own a refrigerator , 
and then do , you know , that number , a freezer separate from 
yeah  , 
i mean , on automobiles and trucks , 
and , uh , the only reason i didn't , uh , get into that more , when i on vehicles tend to be greasy and dirty to the nth degree 
 and i mean , 
so , uh , that's why i towards , uh , uh , 
and that's a uh , make a mess . 
um , yeah , 
i hate to see a car going down the street , or even a truck or bus for that matter , that's putting out a lot of dark 
and i know there's a lot of pollutants we can't even see coming out of 
but that particular bothers me . 
well , uh , you know , the busses with the diesel 
because when diesel is burned it's it , 
you know diesel fuel is burned in the diesel engine 
it's burned so completely , that you don't have any , uh , nitrous oxides , uh , or oxides of nitrogen , uh , to , uh , form 
diesel is going to be around , because it doesn't evaporate easily , 
and it's got , 
well , you know , its latent heat is high , 
but it's slow burning at , uh , normal pressures . 
that's why your diesel engines have such high compression ratios 
oh , i see . 
 and so if the car sucks in , uh , fifty degrees , 
well , how do you feel about trial by jury ? 
i feel very uncomfortable with trials by juries recently . uh , 
in what way ? 
in that it seems to me that they are swayed more by emotion than , uh , by evidence that's presented . 
i have , uh , very little regard for the law  ,
i was thinking primarily criminal cases . 
so , do you think that , i mean the stereotypical bleeding heart juries 
uh , i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges . uh , you know , doing the sentencing . 
i like the idea of juries of your peers 
and second of all , you get a wide variety of background 
so that , 
my question i guess are they really your peers ? 
 uh  ,
that's definitely a problem . 
 and , uh , if not entirely on the basis of which color representation you have 
uh , i think that , uh , in such cases , uh , they are not really looking for unbiased people , but rather for biased . 
uh , now i happen to know several judges 
and there is one that i would feel uncomfortable but has doing sentencing without the jury .
 but the other two i feel , uh , would give either you know , the plaintiff or for the defendant the the full benefit of the law . 
and i guess that's what i am concerned with . 
i , guess i definitely agree with you , 
but the 
well , what i don't like about , uh , the jury doing the sentencing 
the same crime gets unequal sentences . 
this is very true . 
uh , the same idea versus you know whether he is guilty 
 but , that measure stick across the board . 
and you do see such uneven sentencing 
but one individual got twentyfive years 
and the other one was sentenced to life . 
of course a lot of that's also the ability of the defendant to , uh , get a good lawyer . 
isn't that the truth  ? 
there are times when uh , 
 oh goodness , my mind has gone blank it's , uh , othello . 
you know where he says kill all the lawyers .
every now and then one is tempted to see what . 
i agree .
 but , it's taken me a long time to understand that , uh , lawyers are concerned with the law and not with justice 
oh , yeah , 
i agree with it 
they will admit to you that they allowing themselves to believe their clients that are guilty 
it's more of the game plan of how do they convince the judge or jury through argument . 
that the  , 
uh , even , 
i have been involved , uh , just slightly in a case where i know the person is guilty 
 but , uh , his attorneys gotten him off . 
uh , the city has dropped their charges against him because the attorney has presented enough evidence of doubt to convince the judge . 
so i don't know .
uh , this is a little bit of the subject , 
but is that i have heard that there are federal sentences , 
you know , actually in this modern day and age , it seems like , uh , uh , we have more and more leisure time because , uh , we have so many appliances and whatnot . 
we don't even have to cook dinner anymore . 
 uh , but uh , 
the kids maybe on the average get , uh , something like thirty seconds of quality time with the parents . 
that's what i've heard too . uh , 
it seems bizarre to me . 
i don't quite understand it , although i think probably at least the modern world today , is television . 
not so much because , uh , it's bad per se , although there is some pretty crappy programming 
and there's also some , uh , i think , uh , poorer lifestyles illustrated but simply because it dominates so much discussionary time . 
it's so darned easy to turn the thing on . 
i know it . 
 so i refuse to have one in the house . 
oh really ? 
well good for you . 
i talk to a lot of people about that 
and i've thought about it myself 
and i though about it a lot 
but , uh , i still haven't done it yet . 
well that's good . 
well i'll tell you . 
television sure makes child rearing easy on you . 
i mean the kids can be a real pest , uh , 
and turning the t v on is almost like magic , you know , 
it's like sticking , uh , an electrode into their pleasure center 
and you don't have to worry about them . 
that's true 
i've noticed that . 
 but i don't think it's too good . 
i don't think so either . 
 uh , so , you know , i don't know , 
i take advantage , 
i don't have a great deal of time to spend with the kids , 
but i take advantage of , um , dinner time . 
we always eat together 
and , you know , whenever you're with your kids , you want to interact with them rather than just ignore them . 
do you keep your kids , uh , active in sports or anything 
uh , i guess our big outlet is music . uh 
oh , okay . 
our thirteen year old son plays violin 
and our ,
 and , uh , when our son started playing violin , i took up violin 
and when our daughter started playing cello , i took up cello . 
so there's plenty of interactive time in , uh , practicing . although neither kid likes to practice . 
i guess that's not a big surprise . 
not for kids .
but most of your time is sort of spent taking care of them rather than interacting with them .
and i take them to the park and stuff 
oh , you know , reading is so good . 
uh , i took great pleasure in reading to my kids when they were little 
and i still try to read to them , although our son is not liking that anymore . 
 well , they get to that stage . 
 uh , but i read , you know 
there's this doctor seuss sleep book . 
have you ever seen that yet ? 
sleep book , 
it's called a sleep book 
and , uh , you ought to get it . 
i tell you i read that book to my kids so many times i almost have the thing memorized . 
we've got quite a few of doctor seuss' books . 
well , i think his sleep book is my favorite . 
oh , really ? 
well , yeah 
i like to do it 
and they enjoy reading . 
i've , actually i never read a lot growing up 
and i never read until a few years ago 
i just started picking up books 
and so i've found that , you know , it's really important to me to get to read . 
to , i like to get away in a book , you know ? 
and so i've put a lot more emphasis on that , on my kids 
 so how 
oh , i probably spend an hour or two . 
oh that's great . 
my wife works at night , 
so she does , uh , tupperware , 
so she's gone a lot at nights 
and so 
 oh , i see . 
how old are your kids again ? 
they're two and one . 
two and one . 
so you have your hands full with them , 
that's for sure .
 i   , uh , try to stay away from cars as much as possible in terms of 
actually , uh , that is really a sore spot with me . 
i think perhaps the automotive industry is improving 
but , uh , like ten years ago , uh , reliability of automobiles , at least u s automobiles was pretty dismal 
and not only that , but the , uh , repair capability of , uh , service departments and dealerships was equally dismal 
 and , uh , it seemed that the only way i could reliably take care of my car was to repair it myself which is not my cup of tea . 
but , uh , i , 
so do you have a car ? 
well , at that time , actually , i had a volkswagen rabbit 
 and , uh , it was a real lemon . 
uh , subsequently i got a , uh , buick century 
and it wasn't as bad . 
but , uh , last year i bought a honda accord 
and i take it in once every seventyfive hundred miles for its periodic maintenance 
and that is it . 
and it's wonderful . 
we used to have a honda accord 
and they're good . 
they're really good cars . 
every time i get taken to an auto repair place , you know , every time i go , i get taken . 
woman goes in 
let's see how much money we can get out of her , you know .
that's what happens every time . 
 uh , so , 
 so , what do you have ? 
i have a pontiac six thousand . 
all the more reason to , uh , have a honda . 
but our honda just got old and just wore out . 
it was , let's see , eleven years old 
and it just out of it 
 so you bought a pontiac ? 
my uh , exhusband's , 
he's my exhusband 
but just a few months ago when he was my husband , uh , his father gave us this car 
and everything is wrong with it . 
i mean , the power steering fluid leaks , the oil leaks , the brake fluid leaks , you know , 
now thi , 
 how old is the car ? 
uh , eightyseven . 
and he just doesn't take care of things 
but i was awarded the car 
so . there is a man in my church that is a mechanic 
and i can trust him . 
so he is trying to get , you know , things fixed on it . 
but it's just , you know , leak , leak , leak everywhere . 
but , uh , you know , i hate to go into a repair place because they'll tell me something is wrong with it and it's not , you know , and charge me twice as much . 
the last time i took it into a repair shop , 
the man told me i needed a master cylinder . 
and he charged me a hundred and thirty something dollars 
and then , uh , about a month later , a man was looking at my car 
and he asked me , 
you know , not a repair man , but just a friend 
and i was telling him that i just a new master cylinder put on 
and he looked at 
 and i didn't even know what one was . 
and , uh , he showed it to me 
and it was old , rusty , just awful . 
it was no more new than nothing . 
so apparently it was the same one that was on there . 
uh , more than likely . 
the brake fluid up 
and that was it . 
that was it , probably . 
it was ve , 
i was so irritated . 
and that's happened to me more than once or twice . just about every time i've went in somewhere . 
so what's the solution to that ? i guess find a reputable service , 
 can hardly find one , you know . 
the guy that's doing most of my car now , uh , goes to my church 
and that's the only reason , you know , i go to him 
and i know he will tell me the truth . 
because he doesn't even charge me for doing it 
so he's not going to , you know , take me . 
i just pay for the parts 
and he does it so . 
well that's wonderful . 
you're lucky . 
i am , 
so , i don't know . 
i don't know what the solution to that is because the place where you buy your car , they're usually the worst one of all . 
we took our honda to the honda dealership 
and they ended up telling us we needed a brand new engine for our car . 
oh , really ? 
 you know , they told us we just had to have one 
and we bought one . 
we didn't no more need no new engine , 
give me break , you know . 
so it was not good 
and , uh .
 uh , i think , uh , actually i'm fairly pleased with the benefits that we have uh , working for a large corporation . 
and , for me , there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit 
it's what , 
i think everybody would say that . 
oh , and if you try to get it outside of your corporation , you're going to pay an arm and a leg . 
belonging to a health group is probably the most important protection you can have after you , 
 uh , the , uh , 
than salary . 
uh , do you also get dental ? 
and , uh , i don't know if i would rank that second 
but , uh , since i have three boys , uh , it can turn out to be important . 
you know 
 oh , i know . 
dental expenses can really kill you . 
now my husband is with , uh , northwest airlines 
and he gets , uh , you know , the full health and dental 
and , uh , we have four children 
and what you pay just to have teeth cleaned is outrageous . 
and i don't know how people that don't have it can afford it . 
it's , uh , 
or maybe they don't .
uh , and then , uh , uh , if the  cleaning  doesn't get you , the orthodony will . 
that's right .
uh , i guess that would be up there . 
uh , i'm not sure say compared to retirement 
or , uh , uh , uh , pretax savings was another thing that i think is a 
 and uh , the government ought to encourage more because , uh , there are all these complaints about how we're not a saving country 
 well , it's a lot easier to save it when you don't get your hands on it first .
you can , uh , offer some incentive 
and if the government goes along by not taxing it when you put it aside 
 and   , 
 uh , in the corporation . 
for example , uh , oh , 
 do they have father leaves or anything like that ? 
they may have , uh , just plain parental leave , which either one can take . 
uh , uh , i know their maternity leave is on the order of six weeks which i think is too short . uh 
oh , i do too . 
 uh , uh , i really think that we need to get into the mold where we talk about years rather than months or weeks . 
oh , i think it's just a crying shame , uh , 
and , uh , 
she isn't recovered .
 and , uh 
  there   , 
there ought to be , uh , uh , some compromise where the person would be guaranteed a , uh , career type position but not necessarily a continuation of exactly the same position 
i agree . 
uh , it's so important to families then 
uh , and yet anybody who's gotten far enough to get a good salary is really reluctant to give that up . 
oh , sure . 
especially in this day and age . 
you don't want to start over again anywhere . 
you're right . 
i think you've put your finger on the one benefit that i would most like to see , uh , changed . h , the , uh , parental leave . 
well , i think they've come a long way .
and , uh , as manager uh , they have a very , very poor leave policy 
and , uh , i just don't know how women do it . 
particularly , single parents who don't have the support at the other end . uh , 
they do it by shortchanging their kids . 
there's no other way . i mean 
that's right . 
   people moving as much .
and , uh , it's just a terrible choice , 
you shouldn't have to make it . 
uh you're right . 
and , uh  , 
one of the benefits we get , of course , is travel .
 oh , right . 
would i like to have that . 
the only trouble is that you can afford to go anywhere 
but you can't afford to stay once you get there .
 oh , listen i have friends in a lot of different cities . 
if you just fly me there , 
i'll take care of that .
 that's right . 
you have to have an awful lot of fun 
has to be half the fun . 
 and , uh , i guess the , 
 and you say you have some strong feelings about , uh , the issue ? 
 uh , yes 
i think that , uh , we simply must start accepting everybody in the world . 
uh , i , 
there just is not going to be room for all of us . 
we don't have jobs now . 
uh , i think when we come to a time of recession that it's particularly important that we shut our doors at that time . 
uh , i hope you're one of the employed right now . 
i am one of the unemployed right now . 
i was a systems analysis and programmer for an oil company 
and , uh , i applied for one set of jobs with a company here in dallas that they had two hundred openings 
but they had two thousand applications . 
and i know that there are a lot of foreigners , uh , here , you know , doing my line of work . 
and , of course , i'm not perfectly happy about not having a job . 
so , how do you feel ? 
well , i'm a little bit ambivalent . 
in terms of what , uh , really is driving it . 
they're not willing to tell the truth . the same way with , uh , issues of , uh , race and things like that .
i mean right now , uh , i believe there are two policies uh , that the government uses to modulate immigration . three actually . 
one is at the high end , uh , 
they always want to be able to , uh , do some brain draining . 
they always like to be able to attract the , uh , einsteins or the professor chou 
or , you know . 
they'd like to be able to get the top people in any field 
and so they can almost always find room for someone like that . 
at the bottom end , they , uh , 
those are two things that i think are going on . although i don't think the politicians would tell you that . 
and i think you're right in both cases . 
and then the ,
they cannot close off the mexican border . not because it's physically impossible but because the explosion that would take place in mexico uh , uh , 
so they keep allowing , uh , the pressure cooker to let off steam . 
 and i think probably it's pretty important right there . 
how do you feel about haitian immigration ? 
i think they're a very difficult group to integrate into , uh , society . 
they're very difficult , uh , group to find jobs uh , and , uh , places for . 
and so , uh , uh , i don't deny that we may have been involved in causing the problem uh , in that they're pretty miserable where they are . 
but i'm not to sympathetic about , uh , letting large numbers of haitians in . 
actually , actually i feel that if we accepted these people that we would eventually have almost the total population here . 
and it would have nothing to do with political situations . 
it would have to do with poverty . 
but you know , it wouldn't make that big a bulge in the population . but 
oh , my gosh . 
 have you been to southern florida ? 
uh , i mean it is now with haitians the way it was with cubans , uh , twenty years ago . 
 well , i mean and the two of them together . 
i mean we can , 
it's just as well you know , 
it's hardly america anymore . 
on the other hand , you know , .
so uh , there's a lot to be said for having a steady stream of people who know how it is someplace else coming in . 
but there's some differences in the immigrants ,
i think ,
but , uh , 
uh , they don't bother to learn our language 
and , uh , first of all , they , 
i'm sorry , i really feel strongly about this . 
we send a lot of money to mexico . 
why don't you start ? 
oh , i don't know . 
handed down . 
you know , it's nice tongue and groove , uh , uh , construction . 
uh , i've been pretty successful with that . 
i've done both .
and , uh , we've done it a couple of times . 
i guess that 
 oh , yeah . 
uh , that's a kind of low risk sort of project , isn't it i guess . 
that's a good way to get started . 
uh , i have a , uh , really nice desk . a nicer desk than i could afford . which i got because my sister who worked in a hospital , uh 
and , uh , we stripped it all the way down and refinished it 
and it turned out to be uh , a nice desk . 
a , up rolltop desk from scratch . 
oh , really ? 
you know , a kit . 
oh . i'm jealous . 
still had to cut it and everything , 
do things , uh , that might be too crude to be called woodworking . 
i've built my own deck and , uh 
i've done the same . you know , like the trim around the house you know 
and , uh 
and so i do have a band saw and a router and , uh , things like that out in the garage . 
but i can't say i use them very often .
um .  yeah  
 , i'm looking at trying to get a router right now . 
putting doors in is the time when i'm , 
uh , i bought myself a , uh , template for making mortices and doors 
and that's a whole lot easier than doing it with a chisel .
 i'll bet . 
 but on my , uh , radial arm saw is a little bit uncertain .
so , i got one for christmas a few years ago and used it quite a bit for the first eight months i had it 
and now i use it twice a year maybe .
my brother's used it a lot for making drawers . 
i don't 
the big , 
what a good router is like ? 
 you know i , 
 uh , i guess it , 
because he was tell me like the ones that you dial in aren't all that great . 
they've plastic parts and stuff . 
the ones that what ? 
that you dial in on the side . 
uh , i have never even looked at one closely . 
uh , the 
uh , i have i'd guess you'd call a medium quality craftsman router 
and the , uh , 
how strong is it ? 
it's strong enough for any job where you don't try to take more than say threeeighths of an inch at a time . 
but the problem is that the , uh , as with 
don't they , 
 so a good set of bits is probably going to run you a hundred dollars 
and , uh , uh , if you're going to use for a lifetime i suppose it's worth it . 
because e , uh , 
i imagine if i go and sharpen them myself , uh , they won't last .
and i've never had the bits sharpened .
especially , i did some cabinets in , uh , ash and oak 
 and , uh , that wears a bit down . 
we remodeled and saved a bunch of really nice ash cabinets , uh 
and , uh , 
i've cut some one by eight oak before .
boy was that fun . 
that's , uh , 
big solid pieces of oak are just 
like , oh my gosh . 
is this going to be fun  ? 
well i've used mine on treated wood 
and now all my blades need sharpening .
treated wood can really make you sick too . 
so , um , 
 uh , well we started out keeping a budget about two years , ago , 
we have a computer , here at the house , 
and i made a lotus spreadsheet and went through the year using all of our checkbook to figure out what we spent each time and whether we were over or under for each month 
and then basically since then what i've done is keep track of it through the checkbook 
so that based on the check coming in , then how much i'm spending each half of the month and then trying to also spe , 
because our house payment is once a month , 
that's our biggest , uh , expense 
so i take half of that amount out of my checkbook with each paycheck ,
a running total . 
what do you all do ? 
uh , we've , uh , taken how much we have , you know , write down how much we have coming in each month 
and then , uh , we've , 
at the beginning of the year we sat down and determined how much we could spend . 
we made up different accounts like , you know , 
we've set a budget for each , you know , household expenses , or food , and clothing and entertainment and then our own fun money and just stuff like that 
and then we write down each time we spend something , we write down in a book 
and at the end of the month we tally it up to see how close we , you know 
we try to stay within a certain budget , 
is it hard to keep track of it 
or does it work out pretty well ? 
um , it takes some dedication to do it , 
but it works out real well , 
so i , you know , 
and then we have that , you know , 
if something comes up and you can't stay within it then we have , uh , you know , a budget for , you know , like we call our slush fund or something 
and some , an unexpected comes up , then you know , you don't feel it so strapped . 
you don't have to go out and borrow it somewhere and do that . 
because you know , we don't charge anything that we can't pay off by the end of the month . 
that's a good choice , 
we're trying to , uh , do that this year . 
we've budgeted the money that we were spending on a  coda  account with t i and then money we were also buying stock with for that year , 
we've taken that this year ,
 you've got paper under your table . 
and , uh , 
and so we hope by the end of this year ,
to be out of that . 
free . 
the only thing we have , it to pay off is a automobile loan and our house payment , 
and that's the only thing we ever , 
that's good to be in that kind of shape . 
we try to stay out of debt .
what are you all trying to do long term . 
huh . oh it's long term . 
we just , 
 you know , his retirement plan and then to  coda  and stuff like that , that's all we , 
and you know , we just have our life insurance for right now . 
so , we don't have any long term , you know , in stocks , or anything like that right now , 
mostly what we put in so much a month , 
or so much a pay check and then they match it . 
that's what we're doing . 
so that's worked out pretty good 
and then , i used to work for t i 
and i have , 
when i retired from there , or left , i took the money that i had in mine and put it in an i r a 
and we had an existing i r a 
so both of us have some money in an i r a that we're also trying to figure , 
we're putting it in c d's right now , 
and then we're also looking at it in possibly getting a mutual fund . 
when ever we get enough saved we stick it in a c d for a while 
it's expired 
the other thing that we've done , that was really nice to see , we had one of the financial companies , um , 
uh , john hancock company came out 
and their agent did a long term analysis based on salary and , uh , what our , uh , goals were on a long term budget in terms of retirement , kids college , paying off the house , buying a different house ,
and they did an analysis for us based on what we were putting in and the time frame that we wanted to look at ,
or not , 
that sounds interesting , 
we've never done any , 
we have , 
you know , our life insurance guy has come out , you know , 
and he's you know , we need if something were to happen . 
is figuring out , uh , what we would need if something happened to my husband , or what he would need if something happened to me , 
that's a big thing to think about . 
yeah , you know , 
if , i would sell the , you know , 
if , something would happen to him , i wouldn't stay in texas , 
i would , uh , sell the house and move back home , you know , to my home town , 
and , uh , i wouldn't stay here in texas , 
so you know , i don't know what he would do . 
i guess that's most of my , um , financial plans right now . 
mine too . 
is there anything you'd like to add ? 
well it's been nice talking to you . 
bye , bye .
how do you usually keep up with current events ? 
hour a day , 
and then i supplement that with , uh , radio news from my car radio and from a news magazine once a week ,
do you , 
i don't usually have time to read the newspaper everyday , 
so i try to listen to the radio in the morning and try to catch one of the morning talk shows , 
and then i usually end up flipping through c n n and headline news during the evening . 
i always try to read the sunday paper just because it usually gives a summary of the week's hot events . 
so , i try to catch that , if nothing else . 
that's true , 
and how do you rate the , uh , 
 are you pleased with the news coverage that you're receiving ? 
for local news i think we do real well where it's , 
we live in a kind of small town , 
but i think we get excellent local coverage ,  um   , 
and i like the national news that we see , 
we watch n b c 
and i think they do a real good job . 
how about you ? 
on the whole , i'm pleased when i have an opportunity to hear just the facts . 
i would much prefer that they keep their analysis to themselves . um , since i don't necessarily agree with it or it tends to be extraordinarily trite . 
uh , i think i'm fed up with trite . 
there seems to be more and more of it , 
and i understand the void that , uh , comes naturally with both radio presentations and television presentations 
and a , 
but i think there's enough news out there that they could pass on more factual information to us , 
and like you said , save the commentaries because i'm going to listen to the news and draw my own opinions . 
i don't really need their help to do that . 
we're certainly in agreement there . 
i don't think radio is as bad to do that as t v is . 
radio seems to have a full platter or full plate of different things that they need to get done . 
maybe they're a little more efficient ,
i don't know which that answer is . 
uh , i think my greatest complaint about news programs is programs like sixty minutes . 
do you watch that ? 
but i don't anymore , maybe once or twice a year . 
well , i used to watch sixty minutes until they did two programs ,  uh   , that i knew both the people and the incidences , 
and i knew that they had presented an extremely slanted viewpoint ,
and it , ever since that time i just don't watch . uh , 
so , i guess we have the same reaction whether we came about it from the same place or not . 
well , i had heard a couple of people , you know , that i had talked to about certain programs say that , you know , they had read other things besides what sixty minutes presented and that they didn't present it nearly the same way as the , you know , news articles or whatever they had already been familiar with . 
so , i started questioning just how bias they really were , 
i don't know how old you are , 
but it seems to me like the last , uh , newscaster that presented news in just the nice simple factual way that i wanted to hear was walter cronkite . 
so , i don't know if you're familiar with him or not . 
in the last few years just his kind of informal segments i've seen 
but i never got to see his actual nightly news . 
i liked , 
i did grow up with david brinkley . uh , 
well , brinkley was sort of trying to be in the mold ,
and he did a pretty good job . 
the huntley , brinkley report was quite excellent ,
and i always liked david brinkley 
and i used to enjoy john chancellor's style of reporting , 
but on the nightly news , now , he goes into his commentary 
and that's where i with him . 
i frequently disagree with his commentaries , 
well , once they've reported the facts , all they can offer is an opinion anymore . 
what did you think of the news coverage of the war ? 
well , i almost felt like it was too much . 
indeed , i found myself restricting my viewing to a couple of hours a day , one in the morning and one in the evening . 
uh , i spent a number of years in the service as an intelligence analyst , 
and i don't need their fillins , you know .
 did that help you understand a lot what was going on your prior experience with the military did , 
i wondered if it would help you sometimes fillin the gaps or recognize discrepancies that people like myself might not pick up on . 
what weekly , um , magazine do you look at , 
is it , 
i like u s news and world report . 
at one time or another i've taken them all for a year . 
i believe in giving anything a chance . 
uh , but i keep coming back to that one , 
so , that's kind of my favorite . 
does that give a pretty good overview of everything 
or like , does it give , um , i guess , little encapsulated reports and then a few big stories ? 
it's primarily , um , a few big stories and then lots of highlevel reports . 
uh , here's what went on in asia over the past week , 
and there's maybe a page of that , little brief paragraphs , unless that was the focus of their main stories . 
that sounds good if you were short on time , you could get a summary real quick . 
uh , it too is one those   
in the interest of efficiency we all have to find ways , 
and i do most of my reading in the bathroom . 
um , and it's one of those that i can read either an article or a couple of pages of those brief excerpts in the time frame that i'm going to spend in there . 
and it just seems to fit nicely , so that i can get it read in about three days . 
well , we're working on a newsweek , uh , 
for the last couple of months we got , you know , an introductory subscription , 
so , we decided to try it because prior to that all we got were things like glamour or sports illustrated . 
so , we decided to try to bring one in that was a little bit better for us , so to speak . 
well , to broaden your horizons , make you think about different things anyway . 
it can't hurt , .
well , anytime that we stop and think it can't hurt . 
i enjoy reading t news , 
i try to catch it because it's another example , 
they just show you the words and the facts 
and they don't offer any commentary , 
and it gives me a quick chance to be caught up during the day . because , you know , we don't listen to the radio at work at all . 
so , i don't like to go the whole day without hearing anything . 
oh , i'm with you , 
i have to check t news every day . 
it's my noontime dose of facts . 
and the other thing we have that i like to check sometimes is , um , talking fingers , 
do you have that ? 
you have different telephone numbers that you can dial , 
and then you dial in an access code 
and depending on what topic you called in to hear about whether it was the news or the weather or a soap opera update , it will give you , um , updated information . 
so , that can give you , you know , current news updates , current weather updates , things like that 
and it's offered through the local phone company free of charge . 
so , that's ,
well , it does sound very interesting , 
maybe our phone company out here will get around to ,
so , that is something you might keep your eyes open for , 
i think it's catching on throughout the country .
well , how do you feel about it ? 
well , uh , i don't have any strong convictions about it , 
that's for sure . 
um , i know i haven't done any peace corps service , 
and i don't know anybody in my immediate family that or , you know , has ever even thought about it . 
uh , do you know anybody that's been it ? 
and that's only because i went to baylor , 
and a lot of students from baylor go and serve as missionaries during the summer . 
but i think that's a terrible idea . 
that's like forcing someone to donate to a charity . 
i mean , and it's nice to donate basically their time and efforts , 
it's definitely up to the person , uh , 
so , i'd have to say that , uh , you know , the people who do it , well , some feel it's rewarding . 
i don't know , you know , 
but , uh 
you have to , 
i don't either . 
i have nothing to say about this . 
i don't either . 
i think that's dumb . 
but , uh , 
well , how long you been in san antonio ? 
i've been here for , um , just well , no , almost four years . 
um , okay . 
and i lived with dana in school . 
oh , okay . 
that's how we know each other . 
oh , okay . 
had a good old time . 
well , that's good . 
well , back to the topic at hand . 
 what other types of community service would they be talking about . 
i mean , the recording mentioned the peace corps . 
well , i mean , this is like major long term commitment , like a year 
so you're looking at the peace corps or sabbatical maybe , 
or , you know , i don't know , 
i mean , but , uh , 
i mean , i'm all for donating my time to worthy causes , 
like i do some volunteer work here and there , 
and every once in a while i'll do , uh , a , uh , local big brother big sister thing . 
or i'll go , you know , do a   .
but what , 
i couldn't possibly commit a year or two of my life to go do something . 
they couldn't cover my hourly rate .
i couldn't afford it . 
no kidding . 
but , uh , 
i have this thing against bugs , too . 
and seems to me like the peace corps , 
they send you someplace that there's a lot of bugs   .
have to live in a shack with no air conditioning and no medicine and no anything . 
i'd probably catch a terrible disease and die . 
well . i doubt that , 
it would have to be tough going somewhere you don't know the culture , usually , i guess . 
i think that maybe that's why some people do it is , uh , to see the other cultures you know and some of that . 
but , uh , to do that , i don't know , 
i'd have to be , 
i don't know . 
oh , i don't know either . 
  growing up , all i knew was you go to high school , you know , you work , you go to college , you get out of college , and you get a good job and you work . 
to broaden your horizons . 
uhhuh . well , you know , uh , i know american express , 
i'm working at american express now , 
and they , 
after a certain amount of years of service , these employees can take off like six months or something , for some type of sabbatical or something like that . 
and they're allowed to take that time off and then come back where they left off . 
so , it is something that i think , uh , you know , even the larger organizations will support . 
uh , to give back to the community type of thing . 
i don't know , 
i think , at the same it's for some people to , you know , help them grow in other areas , 
kind of like joining the military . 
well , i mean , in that respect a lot of people join the military to grow up 
and the peace corps or something like that is probably useful as that kind of a time . 
maybe a little bit in that perspective , 
 uh , and a lot of people have gone in the military , i mean , you know , when they're in the college . 
sometimes it's to help support college , you know , 
uh , people don't know what they want to do . 
but as far as , uh , you know , the peace corps . i guess , i suppose there's a few people that have done it at that point in their lives . 
but i think a lot of it's , you know , when people get older , they'll do something like that . 
i'd probably have a different perspective if i actually knew someone that had gone into the peace corps . 
but i don't . 
i don't . 
and none of my , 
didn't mean to cut you off there . 
oh , that's okay . 
 and none of my really close friends in college went off to be missionaries or anything . 
so i don't really know anyone first hand committed a chunk of their life to do service work . 
everybody i know has been , 
well , i'm going to go get a good job and make some money and buy a nice car . 
yeah , or try to make a living . 
but , uh , 
i don't know anybody that's done that either . 
so , i , 
i can't imagine , 
oh , well . well , you'll get it over with here .
i know . 
i use everything with my visa , 
and i pay it all off . 
so that's a good deal for me . 
i get free money for thirty days . 
that's the way i use them , uh 
i try to make sure i don't get in debt . 
well that's always a good plan . 
i had , uh , 
let's see , 
oh , how funny . 
and , i'm out here in phoenix , 
and i can't even 
and you've probably never gardened in your life   .
my grandfather gave me a plant once , 
 and he told me when he gave it to me that it was impossible to kill , 
you could freeze it , 
you could dry it out , 
no matter what , you couldn't kill it . 
well , i killed it pretty quick . 
i don't have too much of a green thumb either . 
i do have one plant here , 
it's been hanging out for a while , 
but i think it's one of the easiest plants . 
i don't know the name of it , 
but i'm not too much into  . . . 
where do you live ? 
uh , in the houston area . 
well , i used to . 
i lived there for a long time . 
but i'm now in palo alto , california which is , i think , the recycling capital of the world . 
oh , that's great . 
so , we have many recycling activities 
and i'm , in full , uh , support of all of them . 
oh , we are too . 
our community is , uh , just starting to get organized about it . 
they just opened up a recycling center where we go and donate our things and dump them off ourselves . 
and , uh , it , 
well , that's something 
but it seems to me that we've gotten a whole lot better , um , cooperation out here , uh , by setting it up so that we pay just a little bit extra , uh , 
actually i don't think we pay very much extra at all too , 
but the , uh , garbage men ,
i think that's great . 
there's a few places in houston where they're trying that out . 
i don't know if they've done it citywide yet or not where they have the color coded , uh , bags and , uh , bins . 
and they give us one for aluminum and , uh , steel , one for metals ,
and then you can either bundle your newspapers or put them in grocery bags . 
so , we leave three little piles ,
and the garbage men come by and , uh , collect them and leave us new bags when ours get old and ratty or leave the ones if they're still in good shape . 
oh , that's great . 
and , it really pays for itself because , oh , then the city ,
we're all for it . 
our , um , 
we've got several bins to the appropriate places . 
the one thing i wish we could recycle is magazines . 
but they claim that because of the way they're bound they , uh , it's too expensive to recycle them . 
at my office ,
and they're , uh , 
one's for white paper 
and one's for colored paper 
so anything like manuscripts or computer paper or so ,
but we get tons of catalogs and things like that and magazines , 
and there's no way to get rid of them . 
it just seems like such a waste . 
oh , it does . 
but i'm sure that they can , uh , find some sort of , uh , use for them if , you know , you know , there , 
i've seen talk about , uh , using garbage for , uh , energy . 
and so , you know , you could also apply the magazines toward that . 
well , that would be a help . 
i wish they would do that here . 
we have got so little landfill space left that we're going to run out before the end of this decade . 
and it's really going to be a mess when they have to start hunting for places to put the things . 
oh , i know it . 
we did have , uh , another novel , uh , experiment start this year . 
now we can put all our yard clippings out . 
you buy these super giant heavyduty paper bags , 
they're about fourfeet high . 
and you get them for i think it's about fifty cents apiece at the grocery store you , um , usually buy them by the dozen . 
and then you put all your yard clippings and , uh , leaf rakings and anything that will be  compostible  .
oh , uhhuh . 
the garbage men also pick those up on thursdays . 
oh , that's great . 
and then uh , they take them to a special part of our dump where  composting  is now in full swing , 
and at the end of every year , uh , they sell all the composts to nurserymen and to local people who want to put it on their flower beds .
well , that's a great idea . 
i wish we were that , uh , involved in , uh , or that our city was that involved in recycling ,
because , you know , i've talked to many people 
and we wouldn't mind going its extra effort to do it . uh , 
if they make it so that it's not a horrendous inconvenience , i think most people would . 
and i don't mind , you know , 
at first it was the little extra money that you got , you know , returning the cans in and stuff like that . 
but now , you know , i don't mind as long as things are getting recycled , you know , that we don't get reimbursed . 
i think it's , to me more of a convenience to have them come pick it up ,
oh , oh , i know it . 
we still have bins at the grocery stores where you can turn in bottles and cans ,
but so few people , uh , have enough to make that worthwhile you'd spend more in gas getting down there then you get back . 
 plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also . 
now do the grocery stores in houston have recycling for their paper bags and plastic bags ? 
we have , 
reusable cloth bags . 
well , we can get a nickel apiece for any paper bags that we bring back to be reused . 
oh , that's great . 
they just take it off like they do a coupon . 
 they can just  subtract it from your bill , 
and they have a giant bin by the front door for the plastic bags , 
and they say , as long as it's clean they don't want a plastic bag that's full of goop .
here they don't want your rotted tomatoes . 
but they want any clean and dry plastic bag 
so i keep , 
and the thing is , i hardly have room now for all the things that we're saving it to recycle , 
so right outside the back door , i've got the two burlap bags hung up for the cans and bottles , 
and that place where the garbage can is we have the bag for the newspapers , 
and now we've got the bag for the plastic bags .
i understand , uh , 
my husband about once a weekend he'll go , uh , to a couple of areas where he knows that the people just throw cans out . 
oh , yeah . 
and he'll go pick them up because he just can't stand that . 
well , how nice , 
that's great . 
and , uh , it's so , you know , 
of recyclables also . 
i remember at christmas the only thing that i'm , 
when you were talking about the composting , the only thing that our city did that was they uh , provided a place for us to take our christmas trees .
well , that's , 
they just put all our christmas trees in the regular , uh , compost ,
so they did say that you had to put it out within , i think it was , uh , three weeks after ,
and , uh , otherwise you would have to treat it like you would any other lawn refuse . 
it would have to be cut into fourfoot lengths . 
so ,  you know   , if we have branches or something ,
but otherwise , uh , they have to be in one of their paper bags . 
well , that sounds like you all really have a great system worked out there . 
and they even picked up our , uh , styrofoam packing materials . 
and we'll , uh , take all of those back and try to recycle them . 
well , see that's one , 
but i , 
that's not going to be a regular feature . 
that was just a one time thing right after christmas . 
well , the , 
but , uh , something does need to be done about the styrofoam that , uh , 
well , those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills . 
oh , yeah , 
i mean , they don't , uh , uh , 
they don't mash .
they don't compress at all . 
and they stay forever . 
and i've seen where some places have taken a plastic and , uh , they're recycling them into other plastics .
and i think that would be great if they could get something organized along those lines . 
i do too . 
the difficulty with that is that very few people have enough to make it worthwhile . 
they really have to rely on businesses that generate a lot of that stuff . 
uh , because otherwise , uh , you know , they're not going to go housetohouse collecting it , 
and you're not going to bother if you have one bag full ,
oh , i was thinking about , you know , like uh , the styrofoam used at , uh , the fastfood restaurants ,
and so , 
i know like our cafeteria here uses a lot of styrofoam 
but , uh , 
now we quit that about no , three years ago when we got china mugs for everybody . 
and the only difficulty with that is that we're in the middle of a fiveyear drought 
and so it's a real difficult choice whether we want styrofoam cups to fill up our landfills or , uh , china cups to use up our water .
but at the moment we're using the china cups , 
and everybody gets one at the beginning of the year , 
and then , uh , your supposed to keep it recycled every day . 
well , that's good . 
that's a , 
they should last awhile .
well , let us hope that everybody's going to be paying more attention to this and that we will get , uh , better reuse of things 
i believe we are . 
i have to believe everybody is starting to pay attention and take heed of what is happening . 
and so it will be good ,
it sure will . 
well , i enjoyed it . 
well , good to talk , 
the question was , uh , what kind of books do you read for entertainment , uh , uh , i guess , 
oh , i just read for escape . 
well , i mean it's , 
with two little kids i can understand that . 
that's simple . 
i read to escape , 
and i don't read any parents magazines either . 
uh , what kind of , 
well , i just finished one last night . a great book . 
typical for my reading though but a great book , one called , the things they carried by tim o'brien . 
and it's , uh , 
i don't know if i would call it a collection of vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of vietnam love stories . 
strange book . beautifully written . 
by , uh , somebody who was there 
so , he considered himself to be , you know , a true vietnam soldier . 
well , any of the guys that were ground   
i can imagine . 
so , what's the latest one you've read ? 
well , i tell you what , 
i'm a kind of , uh , a history nut . 
i'm trying to think back now , 
i read an awful lot of , uh , periodicals and , uh , you know , almost what you call reference books . 
and , uh , the texas history book . 
i have never been able to make it through any of michener's work . 
oh , well , i've had similar problems . 
it does tend to , 
are you a civil war buff at all ? 
yeah , as a matter of fact , 
because i finished one , 
i think this is like two years ago , 
and somebody had given me one of these dinky do , crappy women's novels set in the civil war , john jakes  with   , 
and the novel didn't do that much for me . 
but , boy , the period of time was fascinating . 
so , i then read , was it battle cry of freedom , 
i think it was battle cry of freedom . 
 battle cry of freedom  .
it's kind of like a historical compendium ,
and it's not a story of the civil war , 
it's a story of all the politics and , uh , lobbying and just basically state by state events ,
and it's fascinating because i had always , you know , been raised on this , you know , proclamation with the civil war . 
as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought . 
well , it was a political move . 
oh , yeah . 
it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because , you know , uh , if you read it , it only emancipated those who were in areas , uh , in rebellion against the united states . 
all the other areas which i think at that time would have included west virginia and , oh , may have been kentucky , a few states , you know , that were not part of the south but still had slaves . 
they didn't emancipate them . 
well , you know what else really surprised me , now 
i'm married to a native texan 
and i'm not . 
i've got the same problem .
i'm glad you put it that way . 
and i have two native texan children too . 
my husband is always , you know , talked about texas being a , uh , rebel state . 
and , oh , my god , all this civil war pride . 
i kept waiting for , 
where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the civil war . 
they might as well have not even been there . 
you know , they weren't a state 
and the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to , you know , who's going to be going there . 
and i keep telling my husband that , 
they supplied some , uh , you know , 
they were some groups of it , the vicksburg , 
if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg , the battleground at vicksburg , uh , there's an area there was , uh , some texas , uh , groups 
and they had an interesting time there . 
oh , i'll bet they did . 
and down there at sabine pass , uh , i can't think of the guy's name 
but uh , you know , just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole union navy for a while from coming up the sabine river which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story . 
well , you know , why they actually held them off ? 
none of the yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar .
now , you didn't hear me say that . 
outside of , uh , 
and then the last civil war battle was fought at val verde , you know , 
over there on the texas border you had a lot of groups heading for mexico 
and they were cut off at the pass more or less , at eagle pass . 
and they didn't get across the river there 
so they're , the last , 
and that was actually after the war was over 
but it was the last ,
texas participation in the civil war was , uh , minor at , uh , 
it's been , 
don't tell that to a native texan though , 
i mean , my god , they fought and won the whole thing . 
well , my wife's from galveston , 
well , i'm from new mexico 
so , you know , i was  , 
that's a beautiful state . 
that's a beautiful state . 
see i was raised in the midwest which ,
and besides , you know , if corn didn't grow there ,
it sounds like iowa or something . 
iowa and nebraska . 
and then i had probably lived the last eleven years in massachusetts 
so , you know . 
oh , well , my sister's living in illinois right now , 
well then , she's going to come out well rounded . 
but outside of those kind of things , you know , the other thing that i've really gotten into reading , 
and i think this is because the kids are getting to me ,
i've always kind of enjoyed it . 
i used to read a lot more than i do now . 
well , i've gone to the point where my husband travels , i get out like , you know , two or three books . 
and i'm trying to think of , oh , isaac asimov , robot series . 
i mean , i think i've read all four of them 
and i understand that there's a fifth . 
in the last  six weeks  he's been on the road a lot . 
i just turned around and looked my , uh , bookcase up here 
and i see armageddon up there . 
and , uh , the shadow of blooming grove and two thousand and ten and grant takes command and the war in the year  , oh , space   that was the one i was trying to wade through was space , james michener . didn't get very far on that . 
you know , i think i read hawaii ,
which is about the developmental level that , you know , you need to be at to read those things , 
and i tried to read , i don't remember which other one it was , 
whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller . 
and i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more , 
it really 
the books are kind of , uh , imposing to say the least . 
let's see , 
here's one called ghost towns and mining camps of new mexico 
now , not too many people have read that one 
i don't think . 
and there's the history of yoakum county , texas there . 
i've got , uh , 
is that a big , thick book ? 
what the hell for ? 
why kingsley , iowa ? 
well , because that's where my folks all came from . 
oh , okay . 
 and they had a centennial here awhile back . 
i read the grant takes command , 
that was pretty good . 
that was part of that trilogy that , uh , 
now that's one that , 
i don't know . 
see , i had never really been into science fiction that much until , uh , somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago . 
i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy . 
sometimes it's awful hard , 
some of those get very philosophical 
they can be in any setting , 
they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting , you know , 
well , i loved that novel . 
and then somebody said , oh , god , this would have been even long ago because i was in boston 
and it was raining all night , 
and i had a hole in my roof 
and i was waiting for the whole house to collapse ,
and i read the whole damn book while i was home hauling out , you know , like tengallon buckets of water and waiting for the roof to collapse and ,
you're reading dune . 
was it ? 
oh , yes , 
i didn't see it 
but , uh , 
it was beyond , uh , 
patrick stewart was in that . 
i don't know , 
i just remember sting was in it . 
oh , really ? .
even having read the book , and i've read that book probably three times ,
i was real disappointed in that . 
well , i'll tell you another good book , 
do you like scary things ? 
um , well , some history ,
have you , 
that's true . 
have you read , the silence of the lambs ? 
they didn't sleep all night . 
well , see i am debating whether or not i want to go see the movie  after having  read the book . 
i mean the book is chilling . 
i have , 
just chilling . 
no , uh , 
then i won't tell you . 
it's just that if you're ever really want to just be scared out of your wits , 
that's the one . 
even better than jaws and some of that ? 
and you're just drawn into his horror ,
i mean , 
and he's suave 
and he's all the ,
oh the worst kind , 
yeah , 
all the characteristics  . . . 
all right . 
um , i understand that it's being proposed as a requirement ,
i think , 
all young americans , they did not specify , you know , exactly what young means . 
i think that it probably would be a good program . 
i think probably two years is too long . 
i think maybe a year would be ,
you're probably right , 
two years might be a little too long . 
and there will be a lot of rebellion in that 
and when you get people who have no desire to be there in the first place ,
that's right . 
so i think it would be a good thing though ,
or maybe offer them , you know , some sort of an incentive to do it .
i'm not sure what 
college credit is a good idea because , 
i'm not sure they need to be , you know , paid , you know , 
a super do salary of any kind . 
but that kind of takes away from public service . 
that's right .
they probably couldn't do anything monetary , 
but i think , giving , 
i'm not sure that would be a terrifically good idea . 
i don't think so either because a lot of people , um , depending on how the public service programs are set up 
and i'm not that familiar with them to know , 
i'm not either really . 
but , you know , if , a lot of people flat can't afford to . 
that's right . 
you know , 
that's right . 
and most kids these days have gotten themselves into , uh , financial situations ,
that's right . 
they need , you , 
so , it's a really tough question . 
that's right . 
they just couldn't , you know , take off to do that . 
and , if you put them in public service right out of high school , then that postpones their college ,
that's right , 
and that would upset a lot of people too ,
it sure would . 
it would have to be a lot of , you know , thought given to something like that , i would think . 
you know , i think it would be good for a lot of people to get involved in that kind of program , 
but i think it can't be something that's mandatory . 
it has to be something that's voluntary . you know , which is pretty much the way it is now . 
they might , 
that's right . 
i'm not even really sure at this point in time , you know , what programs are out there . 
and that's the other thing is that , you know , instead of making it mandatory , they maybe need to publicize it a little bit better .
and you've a choice of where you want to go . 
 handling it that way they could probably get some results out of it . 
like maybe in their own town or city ,
in their own community , 
that's true .
most of them probably wouldn't do something like that .
that's right . 
that's true too . 
but , they would have to be supported in some way , 
and i'm not sure that those programs are available to do that . 
me neither . 
and , you wonder , you know , what kind of quality job would they do , you know , 
or would they really , you know , make a contribution of some kind . 
it's tough . 
and i don't know who's even proposing it ,
i'm not sure either . 
but , i think , there would have to be a lot more , you know , information , you know , disseminated , before you say ,
i think going to the schools would be the easiest for them . 
you know , it be , 
it would take up more time than anything 
but it wouldn't take up a lot of money . 
they wouldn't have to spend money advertising and things like that . 
that's right . 
you go to school 
and you have a kind of a captive audience , 
get them all in the auditorium , 
and you give them your speech and maybe a little slide show or something , 
and , i think , that they could get some results from that ,
but they don't know where to go to , 
that's right . 
that's a real waste too . 
it really is . 
it is . 
i don't really see the emphasis on things like peace corps , like you know , we saw back , i guess , in the carter administration , 
that was a big thing with him . 
and , as a matter of fact , i guess kennedy may be the one that actually started the thing , or was , you know , really interested in things like that . 
i just don't hear much about it anymore . 
like i say , i don't even know what programs are even ongoing now , you know . 
i don't either .
that's one , 
anyway , it's a tough question . 
well thanks for your time . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
same here . 
take care . 
 you too . 
well , how about you . 
do you use p c s ? 
you and me both . 
it seems everything i do is computer related . 
and if it goes down , then we're stuck all day . 
and so i like the i b m p c , personally . 
but that's pretty much everything i've worked with 
and , uh , i've become so accustomed to it that , uh , it's second nature . 
what do you use ? 
well , i have an , i b m p s two , model thirty . 
it's kind of getting too slow for me , 
but i'm an  e d p  auditor , 
so i audit , uh , computer applications both on the personal computer and the mainframe level . 
oh , huhuh . 
and i use my personal computer constantly , 
not only do i do p c type things like , uh , using lotus or word processors , 
i also use my p c to emulate a mainframe terminal for our i b m mainframe 
oh , okay . 
so all i have on my desk is my p c , 
but i'm getting , not only our local area network , 
but i'm getting two separate mainframe machines , also . 
oh , okay . 
so an i b m p s two also . 
and , um , you know , every now and then the file gets so big , that , you know , it moves slower than i'd like 
 but uh , i do mainly graphic work on it .
and , uh , i don't know , 
i enjoy working with them . 
there's so many capabilities out there , 
i mean , the things you can do are endless . 
i've become kind of the p c guru in our audit department because it's mostly financial auditors with an accounting back ground , 
and there's three of us e d p auditors 
and one of the three of us has an accounting background 
and so she's not real proficient in p c's 
and the other just has ,
so i ended up taking on the load of making sure everybody knows what they're doing 
and i'm the administrator for our local area network . 
and i need to keep that going 
i don't have one at home , 
we have one at home , 
but i just don't find the time that i can use it . 
right now i would rather not have one at home , because i would work at home . 
um , we've got a couple of portable lap top p c's at the office that i end up bringing one of them home a lot ,
if i had a machine already installed at home i would probably work just about every night .
one of the reasons why i got mine , was before i went on maternity leave , 
they didn't know how they were going to do without me at work because , i am pretty much like you said , the guru ,
um , so they didn't know how it was going to work , 
they knew they were going to have to get a modem so that we could make it through this eight weeks or so . 
but , uh , you know , uh , it's almost like we could become too dependent on them . 
and oh , we use a lot of free lance . 
and , uh , that's , uh , pretty much takes up a lot of our day so for as producing transparencies and things . 
and , um , it , 
uh , compared to the way the things have upgraded ,
what's the word i'm looking for , 
i'm just totally drawing a blank .
but , uh , the way things have changed over the years with the p c and the different programs is just great . 
it's remarkable the things we can do now , and compared to , you know , a few years .
i'm trying to , uh , get an updated machine . 
mine , uh , is just putting along .
and it's not fast enough for a new four eighty six chip , 
but , uh , 
but i'm determined to brake mine 
so he has to get me another one . 
we think about that a lot . 
well , that's what i do . 
we had a printer , a hewlett packard ready writer . 
and we had about ten people sharing this printer 
it was attached to like a central p c 
and you had to take your diskette to the p c to print something . 
um , now that's awful . 
so i talked my boss into investing in uh , a uh , real elaborate local area network , 
but we can share the printer 
and we can , uh , send files to each other , 
and we can send mail messages to each other ,
oh , okay . 
it's what we need . 
and then i talked them into buying a h p laser jet . 
oh , yes . 
and that was a major ordeal to get him to buy it . 
but once he bought it , he has been so pleased . 
it's fast , 
it's quite , 
oh , it has good copy . 
the copy that you can   with one of those as compared to one of those dot matrix printers . 
i've got a little , uh , i b m pro printer on my desk , 
and i can use either the pro printer 
or i've got my p c configured to where i can use either printer . the one that's on the network or my own . 
so if i just need something real quick , i don't feel like getting up and going and getting what i printed , 
i can just print it in my office . 
um , we're just trying to talk ours into getting a laser printer . 
and , uh , it's just so , 
the budget restraints and things like that , makes it difficult 
and , uh , 
they have gotten really cheap . 
hewlett packard makes , it's actually a dot matrix printer 
 but the quality is almost laser quality . 
oh , huhuh . 
and i think it's called the desk jet 
and you understand , i think they're about five hundred dollars now . 
and we , uh , got a quote on some laser printers the other day at six hundred dollars . 
oh , really . 
but , uh , we do a lot of transparencies . 
sometimes the color would take too long to plot out . 
so they just want black and white , which   see we can just run them through the laser printer real quick .
but , uh , it , uh , 
so that's all you need for like   charts and stuff . 
you don't need them in four colors . 
we would want to razzledazzle a bit . 
but , uh , it's , uh , 
we have one in the office 
and if you know , like you said , you had to change it , put it on a disc ,
you use the  sneak ,  system . 
and , uh , wait for an opportunity to use it . 
you'd have to just sit and wait while someone else was using the printer . 
until they got off the machine . 
i know , 
i understand . 
that was , 
i was amazed when i came to work , 
i worked at the , uh , 
well , it used to be the largest bank in san antonio until n c n b came up and bought the rival 
and now n c n b . 
but it's the only , uh , 
well , it's part of the bank holding company and that bank holding company of the ten largest banking holding companies in texas . 
it's the only one that's still alive . 
oh , huhuh . 
any way , i work in a big prestigious place . 
and i couldn't believe when i walked in the door on my first day and here's the audit department of this huge holding company , sharing a h p rugged writer .
come on guys , 
this is crummy . 
so how are you supposed to expect to stay number one when you're behind the times in technology . 
we're pushing real hard though . 
we're trying , 
well , see , the entire bank is not like that . 
the bank philosophy is one of innovation and ,
it's just the audit department happened to be just a little behind the times because uh , the senior vice president , over audits , is cheap . 
and it's real hard to pry money out of him to do these things , 
but i was able to convince him that it would be cost effective and that our board presentations would be much better 
we find it or hard to understand when , uh , we work for a computer company , and , uh , how are we supposed to present the imagine that we're supposed to present with equipment that's outdated , 
and some of the guys that run this place are very tight 
can't you do that with , you know , what we have , 
unfortunately , and related peripherals are changing and improving so rapidly , 
like for instance , we bought a  . . . 
okay , 
that made a nice ugly sound . 
your name is lynn ? 
linda . 
so , sounds like you like to read . 
i don't read as much as i would like to either . 
i'm a single mom , 
but i have always loved reading . 
what do you like to read ? 
um , well um , a therapist by trade , 
so most of my books are , um , i guess what you'd call self improvement type of books . 
that what i've been reading lately a lot of . 
um , my interests switch around dramatically . 
i used to read just , mainly fiction , 
and now self help books . 
what kind of things have you read ? 
oh , i read all kinds of things for , um , helping people survive a divorce . 
uh , the road less travelled was probably one of my favorites . 
have you read that ? 
you haven't ? 
what would you recommend ? 
good self help . 
well , um probably the best one that i know of and i work with all the time is called search for significance 
um , that sounds good . 
 and it's one that we use in our work . 
it's probably one you'd find in like a christian book store . 
i don't know what the chains are down there . maybe in the mall family book store , something like that . 
i'm writing it down . 
that that's sound really good . 
um , what kind of counseling do you do , 
or should we stay on the topic of books ? 
but that has a little bit to do with some of the things that i read .
i'm a therapist for rossa . 
it's a christian treatment organization 
 and because of that i see , uh , work with adolescents specifically , 
so i see a lot of kids with various problems . 
right now some of the things i'm working with are kids that are dealing with sexual abuse , 
so a lot of the books i've been reading have to do with helping them get through those issues . 
oh , i would imagine helping them feel good about themselves 
they're at a bad stage anyway , 
and then to have to deal with sexual abuse 
uh ,   that must be a wonderful feeling to be in that profession and be able to make a contribution like that . 
oh , i'm sure , 
uh , what oth , 
is that just the only type of reading you've been doing , 
or have you read any good novels lately ? 
um , i guess i've got so many books like that that i need to read 
it's hard for me to do a lot of , uh , 
just joy reading . 
i hear you there , 
that's for sure . um , 
in fact , 
i guess , the last book i've read , 
my oldest daughter had to read lost horizons for her english class , 
and i just realized i had never read it growing up . 
so , i just finished reading that for enjoyment . 
um , that's neat . 
and it was good . 
um , she , didn't enjoy it much , 
so i didn't get much satisfaction trying to discuss it with her . 
but i thought it was real interesting . 
i've always wanted to go back and read some of my literature texts from college 
but i never seem to have the time to do 
i know . 
um , i trying to think of some of my other favorite books , 
but , i keep lists , 
i must have a list of , oh , three hundred books that i want to read . 
just like ,   i want to read that and i write it down . 
i've got a stack next to my bed .
so do i . 
i tend to get a little bit of ways in a book 
and then have to start on another one , 
it's pretty tough to keep up with . 
i was trying to think of , 
i've got a copy of the road less travelled 
but i was trying to think , there's another scott   book that i've got that i had read . 
uh , he also wrote people of the lie . 
that's the one i was thinking of . 
i bought that one , 
and i didn't get involved in that one as well . 
there's another one he wrote that even sounds better , 
and it's kind of the whole concept of global peace , you know , like , and communities 
someone just recently said something really neat about that . 
uh , i got involved in , uh , beginning experience weekends , 
and , uh , it was of the people from there that said that . 
his latest book , and i can't recall the name of it , is just excellent , 
and his whole idea is , we can build a better world if people get involved in good community building projects . 
and he did , uh , mention beginning experience weekends as you know , one of the places . 
so , i've ha , um , 
that's interesting . 
it really was . 
a real fun seagull 
i can't think of his name . 
is it    ? 
pardon me 
 uh , no , uh , oh , 
but a bridge to forever . 
those are   mind expanding books .
his concepts are so different than what i would have ever dreamed of . 
i can't think of what his name is right off the bat , though . 
but , uh , they were fun . 
they were real just books for fun . 
have you been involved on the switchboard long ? 
i really just started . 
how did you get involved ? 
my wife has been working for t i . 
oh , i see . 
i'm a former t ier . 
i just recently quit . 
and so , uh , i got myself involved in a sales job , 
and right now , my list of books to be read have to do with , uh , the art of selling . 
oh , uhhuh . 
it's just , i was just thinking , at rossa 
they tend to come out with a new book every couple of weeks 
 so , i keep getting stacks of books i need to read , 
there's never going to be enough hours in the day . 
i don't think so . 
even if you took speed reading . huh . 
i don't think so . 
so , well , i'm trying to think of what other kind . 
do you like to read mysteries . 
do you like ken    ? 
um . trying to think . 
he writes , uh , spy novels , the eye of the needle 
 and , uh , i really have found his books enjoyable .
i like that kind of stuff . 
i think the last novel i read , i guess , in conjunction with my wife over vacation last year . 
it was a , um , last name's    , 
no , it's called this present darkness . 
it's , uh , kind of unusual book . 
it's a lot about spiritual warfare and some things like that . 
oh that sounds interesting . 
it sounds really good . 
hey , you should make yourself a promise that you'll read one novel in the next six months , just for you . 
you know , it's so easy to get caught up on reading just for your work , or , you know , self improvement , 
and you kind of forget the fun of reading .
that's true . 
very easily . 
so  , 
well , i guess we've covered the topic pretty thoroughly . 
i think so , too . 
and i thank you for calling . 
nice talking to you , linda . 
and , uh , i'll have to check out that book you ,
hope you like you it . 
thank you . 
you take care . 
you , too . 
on capital punishment in our state , they give the death penalty for shooting of a policeman , 
and i believe also in i mean killing a rape victim .
and i don't really remember what else . 
what do you think about it . 
i think it's justified . 
very much so . 
i , agree , you know , 
i think it should be in other cases other than just shooting a policeman .
oh , i do too , 
i mean , i think they're doing their duty , 
but i think if they're going to come out and kill somebody else then they deserve it . 
they ought to get it for killing a civilian just as easily as a policeman . 
that's right , 
i agree . 
i agree . 
uh , i heard something on the news the other night they were talking about , uh , oh , i know what it was , 
it was in our little lewisville paper that comes out twice a week on the front page every week , uh , 
there's a little thing at the bottom 
and then you call this number 
and you press like one for yes and two for no . 
oh i think , 
 did you see sixty minutes tonight , by any chance ? 
well , they were showing a segment on a man in philadelphia that's going after the drug dealers . 
he's just a civilian , 
he's a black man , 
and he just got fed up with it . 
and he said he's had his house broken into and windows smashed and his car stolen three times and everything , trying to keep him quiet , 
but he's organizing people , 
and they're going out and marching on the corners and taking back their territory .
you know , i think that's what it's going to take , though . 
i think so , 
i really do . 
oh , yeah , 
it's going to take , uh , you know , 
the police , can do it alone , you know . 
that's right , 
i think you're right . 
 uh , it's going to take all of us getting together , 
i'm sorry , i'm trying to , 
my kid is asking for a kiss and a hug so he can go to bed .
we won't allow this in our neighborhood . 
that's right , 
and it said they're going to other neighborhoods from there , 
and then quite often they'll get shot ,
that's right , 
i think they said fortyone had been shot out of one church in the last year . 
oh my gosh . 
the only thing about the death penalty that they try to be careful 
and they try to be sure 
but these people are on death row for like twenty years , you know . 
i know it . 
an , you know 
if , you know 
you know being convicted is one thing , you know , 
if they're sentenced to death , 
to me you could not sentence them to death unless , the case was for sure . 
i mean it ha , 
well it goes all through the state supreme court system before they're , 
by the time it gets there 
and they've been convicted 
and then they've been sentenced to death , 
they're sure . 
i mean there's no doubt , 
i mean , 
then it should happen , 
there can be no shadow of a doubt in my mind , 
there has to be no shadow of a doubt to get that penalty . 
that's right . 
so once , they've gotten the penalty and there is no doubt , do it , you know , 
that sounds cold , 
but gosh , you know , we're keeping these men in prison for fifteen or twenty years on death row ,
that's right . 
and it's costing us a heck of a lot of money 
and that's terrible to look at it that way , 
it is , 
i know 
but that's the way it is .
if the crime was bad enough that they were sentenced to death , then do it , you know , uh . 
we had one in virginia that was sentenced to death 
and the execution was to have taken place a few weeks ago , 
i don't know if there was anything in your paper about it . 
and there was a lot of protest , 
even robert redford , you know , was protesting this guy's execution . 
so the governor backed down 
and i was so mad . 
oh , man . 
his crime was just horrible .
and those kind of people , i'm sorry , you don't reform them , you know , 
i don't think , 
i really beli , 
you don't . 
if they're the kind of people that commit these  , excuse me , grotesque crimes and have done it over and over and over again , you don't reform those kind of people . 
and being under the influence of drugs is no excuse to me . 
and i don't know , 
the same thing goes with some of these insanity pleas , you know . 
well , if you're insane enough that you can go cut twelve people up into little bitty pieces and bury them in your back yard ,
i have my doubts , you know . 
that's right , 
i do too . 
you know , i don't know , 
i think there's a point , 
some of these plea bargains and all this kind of stuff that they do , it just gets out of hand , 
and i understand you know , that , you know , 
my husband and i , 
wasn't it lewisburg that had a lot of , uh , bad things happening just in the last couple of weeks , 
no . 
i think it was the south east area ,
oh , really . 
my daughter , 
and she was telling me about it . 
oh really . 
yeah . 
uh , i can't remember what the town was , some little area . 
we've had several here lately 
and , it , 
there were several of them in north dallas 
and then it started kind of happening a couple of places in south dallas 
and that's maybe what you were talking about . 
men breaking in , uh , to houses and taking , or a man , 
they think it's the same person , taking , uh , little girls right straight out of their beds at night .
oh gosh . 
and that's the last they se , 
oh , gee . 
is that right . 
i hadn't heard about that . 
i think there's been like six or seven of them ,
they don't kill them ? 
they just mo , 
they've tak , 
and they're all like , um , like anywhere from nine to twelve years old , i think is what they've been . 
and he's taken them and raped them and then brought them right back and just kind of thrown them out of the car in their front yard . 
boy that's scary , isn't it . 
oh , can you imagine , because it happens in the middle of the night , 
so the parent , 
oh , boy . 
you know , can you imagine . 
you wouldn't even dare put these little emblems in the window saying child in this room , in case of fire , you know . 
have you seen those ? 
shoo , you know , i've got one of those in brian's room . 
i never even thought about that . 
god , maybe i'll take it out . 
i hadn't even thought about it .
that's terrible . 
it is . 
well it's really bad that you have to be , you know , 
we were over at a neighbor's tonight 
and , is just a little over two 
and their little boy is like five , you know , 
so there's a big difference , 
and they were playing in the back yard 
and we were getting ready to leave 
and i went out in the back yard to get brian 
and the boys were gone 
and the back fence was open . 
oh , gosh , 
   , you know . 
and she didn't act like it bothered her at all , oh , 
this happens all the time . 
and we walked through the fence out , the alleys , come to the back of the house , you know . 
and i looked down both directions of the alley 
and i saw neither one of them 
oh boy .
and you know , 
and he's five ? 
shoo , i guess so . 
and , uh , brian was two houses down .
and he , you know , 
i don't know , 
i know . 
parents around here just let their kids run everywhere , 
and i just can't do that . 
there was a little girl picked up in rowlett uh , from her front yard 
and her dad was working in the back yard , and had just left her few minutes in the front yard 
and somebody apparently drove up and took her 
and they never saw her again .
oh , man , this is too scary ,
you know , i let brian play here in the back yard 
and there's two gates that go into the back yard 
and we've got one of those big eight foot privacy fences . 
and one of the gates has a padlock on it 
and then the other gate just has one of those slide bar things , 
but it's on the inside , 
you know , they'd have to come over the fence , 
they could not open a gate , you know . 
and i still feel a little uneasy about him playing back there . 
you know , i mean , if i don't hear him playing , i mean , i get up and come out and look out the window real often , you know , 
and watch , 
i don't blame you . 
it's really scary that you have to be that scared about your kids 
better safe than sorry . 
and if they find who's doing that to those little girls , as far as i'm concerned he could ,
he could fry . 
to put it very bluntly , he could fry , 
because sometimes there are crimes worse than murder . 
you know , 
and i believe that , 
and this is one of them . 
because these little girls will never be the same . 
that's terrible . 
never be the same , 
so , i don't know , 
 , it's really scary 
and i don't know what needs to be done , you know 
it seems like there's no room in jails to put them in jail 
and when they do put them in there , you know , 
i'm taking a business law class at night 
and the guy that teaches it is a practicing criminal attorney 
oh , gosh . 
they're going to serve about a quarter . 
it's going to be reduced , 
they'll serve a quarter of it , 
so , if you want them to stay in prison for fifteen years , don't sentence them to fifteen years , sentence them to a hundred . 
you know , because then they'll serve fifteen or twenty , so . 
i don't know , 
it just doesn't seem right . 
it doesn't . 
they just get out , you know , 
there was a thing on , 
well what are we going to do about it ? 
 i mean how can it be changed .
i don't know . 
and they don't seem to , 
that's the thing , 
we're just going to have to adopt a completely different attitude , 
and do it , you know . 
and if you commit this crime , you will be in prison for the rest of your life . 
we're really going to do it , you know . 
it's just the system has just , 
and i understand they're doing it because the prisons are full , 
but somewhere we've got to come up with some money to build more ,
i think so . 
i think it would be worth it everybody wo , 
well , i was watching a show about this the other night 
and , you know , they were like i think it was on fortyeight hours . 
um , there was a crime here in mckinney ,
there was no um , remorse shown by , uh , at least one of the perpetrators . 
and yet , for whatever reason , um , his crime was not considered a capital crime . 
 has no redeeming social values 
and gets free again ,
so , it really bothers me that there's not a way of getting him out of the way forever . 
i think that , 
i don't know , 
i don't think our prison system isn't set up ,
i think it'll only make them worse , 
but , i believe that god can come in and change a person's heart and genuinely change it , 
but , that doesn't negate that you do reap what you sow . 
and if you do kill a person and you know , you're found to be guilty , i believe god establishes the authority of our court system 
and i do believe that capital punishment is , uh , alternative . 
even , you know , god can still change your heart 
but that doesn't mean , 
like the alcoholic that charges up all the bills on the credit card , or the shopaholic , you know you get your life right with god 
but you still have to pay your visa bill . 
that's right .
you still have to , you know , 
but god sent us his grace 
and they give pardons 
but i believe if it's a genuine conversion , there's a genuine , 
and those prison people they know a genuine turnaround in a person's character , 
they see that . 
 and , i worked in a prison in fort worth . 
did you ? 
you see it , you know the ones that have a genuine character change . 
it is obvious . 
and they know that . 
they're not going to pardon someone from the governor , 
you know what i'm saying , 
they're not going to go , without going through every channel of authority in the prison . 
so i feel like you know , they do spare lives 
and , you know , i leave that with the governor , who , of course , is going to go through every authority because they want to be be reelected , 
but , my concern is ,
thank you , i'm sorry , i just got home from work 
and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit . 
that's okay . 
uh , that , not all of them are being convicted of it , they're not even being charged with that appropr , 
i agree with you that , 
right then it was , uh , almost immediate . 
as soon as the trial was over , then it was stoning . 
but , in the old testament , 
we don't have a speedy trial , 
we don't have speedy , um , punishment 
and so it kind of loses its meaning ,
we don't , 
well , yeah 
we definitely have lost the judeochristian ethic of the judicial system for sure , 
but of the system , 
but , i know what you're saying , uh , 
but also , they're under a law , because we haven't been removed from the law 
we've just been taken out from under a law . 
because under the law if your child back talks you ,
that's correct . 
 under the law he would be stoned , 
so we've been removed from being under the law 
but you know , we're still accountable to it . 
we don't need to back talk , 
but , you know , it's like god changes your heart to not do that . 
he changes your heart not to look upon a woman in lust . 
because in the old testament , they could look all they wanted , just couldn't do it . 
but in the new , he's looking at your heart 
and so , i guess that's what i mean by their character changes and , you know , what i mean , it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart , what's the character showing me here . 
and then any of , 
see , if i don't believe that there's not a character change and the authorities agree , that this person needs to be excused , i believe for murder , uh , rape , i even believe incest , things  ,
i believe crimes against children should be punished by death . i believe ,
i tend to agree on that , very strongly . 
and that's where we just have to trust the authorities . 
and they're not going to excuse people , if it was run like that , 
i don't , 
there would probably be very few exceptions to that 
and if it was done quickly and done swiftly 
 they've rejected the answer to all these problems they have , pretty much . 
plus all the judicial system is overloaded with ,
 and having sat on both , uh , uh , criminal and a civil , uh , jury ,
 because we're suit happy . 
as capital punishment is concerned . 
i would like to see or some kind of streamlining so that , if a person is , um , convicted ,
 and go ahead and get the punishment phase out of the way , because it doesn't do the criminal or the victim's family ,
him could be a her . 
i think it's jamaica , i know that they have , you know , crimes punishable by death , 
and i'm sure they hit a few every now and then , 
and i wouldn't want to be one of them , that are not guilty . 
but , i know that they have like , uh , their , crime rate , 
it's not jamaica , 
i don't think , 
i can't remember which , 
it's , uh , one of the caribbean islands 
 singapore , is it like that ? 
my husband's going singapore . 
and they don't have a lot of the crime because there is a law 
and the law is enforced . 
and that's when you have lawlessness , 
i mean the law's not being enforced 
and all that does is lawlessness . 
we went on a mission trip to manhattan and to the bronx and stuff , two years ago , 
and all these kids were up on there getting arrested for crack 
and everyone was out , 
uh , we were across from that big bus station , 
i forget what you call it , 
but anyway , and they had like fifteen people lined up on the fence 
and within two hours , there were fifteen boys sitting there doing the same thing . 
and , you'd see the same kid who were back out there in two days . 
that's sad . 
because , the answer is not being given to them , in the court system 
and i think initially , when our country was set up , it was set up with god 
and it was really an integral part , 
and no , 
you can't force people , 
but i think people are hurting 
and they're out doing crack sitting on the street . 
they were the kind of people that , 
i think mostly , we would want to receive it . 
if it was presented to see . 
i don't know , 
i guess , i'm kind of frustrated that , you know , we've gotten away from the christian basis that our court system was founded upon . 
i mean , it reeks of the bible , just , the whole system . 
and , so i feel like if that was presented more openly , and not just relying upon , that the system itself , 
you know what i mean . 
i feel like that might be better , if it was run on a more scriptural basis , which would include , you know , you know , and expediting the penalties and just getting it over with . 
however , certain uh , very liberal minded groups who do not , um , subscribe to the same ethical system that you and i do ,
 because from any direction ,
i know , you're right , 
they would lobby that 
 and i see that , 
and that's why , you know , i'm like , okay , what's my role in this thing ,  , you know , 
because i don't think the system is going to get fixed . 
i think it's crippled  . . . 
do you go camping very much ? 
but it's is something that i've done in the past . 
how about you ? 
uh , we try to go once , maybe twice a summer . uh , 
that's pretty average to me .
we don't go for you know , week long thing . 
but we usually go to , uh , a lake area , you know , where the campsites ,
do you tent camp 
or do you have a camper ? 
oh no , 
that's what i ha , you know , 
that's how i camp too . 
that's how i define camping .
me too .
you're really roughing it . 
 really not the same . 
as a matter of fact , my , you know , the majority of the amount of camping i've done has been really roughing it . 
um , as a little girl i'd go with my dad and my uncle and my brother , 
and we went to the boundary waters area in minnesota . 
are you here in local texas , 
i mean ? 
where are you ? 
i'm in garland . 
right outside of dallas . 
so um , we have a five year old , 
and she was pretty young when we started , uh , camping with her . 
oh , the kids love it . 
i know . 
i mean , they just love it . 
it's wonderful for them to be outside . 
i know , 
and they , you know , 
 there's no t v , 
and they don't have all these modern toys , 
and they have to use sticks and rocks and stuff like ,
and i like that . 
it's pretty fun . 
well ,  how it ,  
good family thing ,
yeah . 
we try to , uh , go with another couple that have children also . 
and , uh , that makes it a lot more enjoyable . 
plus , you know , we don't have to go out and buy all the equipment and stuff , you know , 
we kind of split it up . uh , 
good planning .
because if you don't want to rough it all the way . 
you know , even the sleeping bags , those are running , you know , a good thirty dollars a pop , 
you're right . 
do you have a boat ? 
want one bad . 
do you ? 
oh , well , actually , you know what i would love ? 
i would absolutely love a sail boat . 
that doesn't go along with camping , 
i would too . 
we usually , 
uh , let's see , 
we try to go to a lake . 
my husband and this , uh , other couple that we go with , her husband , um , kind of likes , um , is it scuba dive ? 
and , so we'll go to a lake uh , where they can go do that . 
we're close enough so they can do that , 
and the girls can play on the beach area .
and i would play on the beach area too . 
that's what i would do . 
 yeah . 
that's fun . 
i'm just sitting here listening to your accent and thinking what a good time the computer is going to have with that . 
am i pretty texan ? 
 but you know , you know what's really funny ? 
um , people tell me that i have a texas accent , 
and i mean , there is just no way i've not picked one up . 
you don't sound like it to me . 
i've only lived here about six years . 
oh , have you ? 
so , if i have one , it must be very , very slight . 
 the yankees can hear it . 
oh , that's true , 
i , see i don't think i do , 
uh , but a lot of people do say i sound like , 
i have , i guess more of a twang ,
are you a native texan ? 
i've lived here all my life . 
well , good for you . 
but , any way , uh ,  , 
have you ever been to austin ? 
how was , 
i'm wondering , i'm really not that not familiar . 
i know there are some good places to go camping along uh , the lakes . 
is there ? 
well , we didn't go camping , 
 uh , we drove down to houston to visit friends , 
so we didn't go camping . 
that would be fun though to go . 
that's one thing my husband wanted to do , on this summer's vacation was to go and camp wherever we went . 
it takes a lot more planning . 
it does , 
 you know , my weeklong vacation , i ,
so , we're hoping to do like a three day weekend . 
there's , um , a thing called pfeiffer rim . 
i don't know if you have ever heard of it ? 
uh , there's a town called glenrose . 
i think it's around two hours from here . 
and , uh , it has like dinosaur tracks ,
 oh , that sounds , 
and it's got one of those wildlife parks . 
i think that'll be fun . 
so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend , go there 
have you ever camped out of state ? 
you know , where you should try ,
where at ? 
it is beautiful . 
is it ? 
i've just been up there skiing , 
and , well , we've driven through , 
 but not , you know , camping or anything . 
but i would love to camp ,
estes state park is fantastic . 
that's what my girlfriend says . 
she loves that place . 
see , you need to go there . 
she loves that . 
she says that where we need to go sometime . 
it's high canyon 
uh , and there's this little mountain lakes 
and it's very peaceful . 
and , um , in the early fall time , 
 um , i can't remember what type of trees they are , 
but all the leaves turn yellow , 
 and it's just brilliant . 
i love that . 
you would . 
you'd like it very much . 
that's neat . 
that's neat . 
i know you would . 
i used to go camping all the time as a girl scout . 
i was too .
 all the time . i got real used to it then . 
i felt like we roughed it then .
uh , well we did , you know , 
i mean , i just don't understand these people that think taking an r v ,
it's not camping . 
i mean , we had to make the fires and dig latrines and everything . 
i mean that is it .
 you have to get poison ivy and all that good stuff ,
well do you say you haven't been in years ? 
um , i'm a struggling single mom . 
 oh , gosh , bless your heart . 
 and , uh , 
 thank you . 
um , it's , you know , 
time is precious , 
money's precious . 
um , and it , 
i think i haven't been able to do it , 
and , you know , that was one of the things i really thought i'd like to do with my children ,
and i'm a little bit fearful of trying that just women . 
i don't blame you . 
you know ? 
i hope , 
years ago it would have been fine 
i have gone on one little vacation , just the girls and i . 
we drove down to port aransas ,
 and that was great . 
and even at that , it was like the first time that i ventured ,
i stayed in a nice place . 
but it's real different not to have another adult with you . 
i kn , 
 you know . 
i can imagine . 
i'm just a chicken . 
i know lots of women would do it all the time . 
i don't blame you , not nowadays . 
i haven't quite adjusted , you know ? 
now are you with t i down there ? 
well , i was with t i until january . 
uh , i left t i in january hoping to strike out and find a job where i could make some money . 
have you ? .
i got into sales , 
oh , that's neat . 
and it's fun 
and it's interesting , 
but it's also , um , pretty challenging , 
and i haven't started making money yet . 
so , yeah , 
now , how old are your girls ? 
eleven and fourteen . 
oh , goodness . 
so i'm old .
you're not old .
honey , i'll be wi , 
go ahead . 
 there's someone at the door . 
oh , okay . 
do you need to go ? 
we always check and see if we should answer the door ,
that's very smart . 
so , well , i've enjoyed this . 
me too . 
and , uh , 
and good luck . 
how many have you made so far , calls ? 
i haven't made any . 
i've been just a recipient .
oh , have you ? 
they're all , 
this is only about my second one i've ever made . 
i've been a recipient on the others . 
how many have you had so far , do you know ? 
i think i've had about four . 
four , 
that's good . 
very good . 
that's four each . 
well , you know , when i had to sup , 
this is my gemini nature , you know , 
it's like what are you interested in , 
 and it's like virtually anything . 
i'll talk about anything to anybody .
i don't , 
you bet , 
and it's been real interesting , the different personalities .
i know . 
i always try to find out where they're from ,
because it is neat . 
it really is . 
well then , i guess i'll let you go so you can go get the door 
well , thank you . 
and , um , i enjoyed talking with you . 
me too . 
you have a good time camping , 
when you go next time ,
thank you . 
all right . 
go ahead . 
oh , um , uh , i usually don't get to hear any of the current events probably until about the ten o'clock news . 
uh , you know , being , uh , 
i mean , by the time you get off work , go by and pick up the , uh , baby from the baby sitter , it's , you know , after six 
and by the time everything is settled in , 
it's ten o'clock before i can catch up on anything . 
i guess that's the way i am too . 
on the radio . 
oh yeah . 
i only get the newspaper on the weekends 
so  , 
oh , uhhuh . 
oh , i don't even have , time to read the newspaper except in passing , 
 you know , i'll look over my husband's shoulder and see what's going on . 
 but , uh , 
we have , uh , a news thing on the computer i'll try to look at every day . 
and , uh , it's pretty much headline news . 
which isn't , you know , pretty much what we look for anyway . 
but , uh . you know , the news events that you get are , 
what do you think about it ? 
well i guess it's pretty good . 
and like the dallas area , 
 and i guess when you're in a big metropolitan area like this , 
there's , i guess , a lot of pressure in that business to ,
well , you know , there's a lot of competition in the media . 
and sometimes i think it too much trying to figure out who's going to get the best headlines . and that they'll run a topic into the ground . 
and , uh . you know , they try to play public's opinion . which i think is awful , because it usually works . 
i'll bet that was the case of the war in the middle east . 
uh , lots of new , uh , newsmen were created during that 
so , it will be interesting to see what happens . 
trying to think what else is , 
uh , uh , 
well , um , i don't know what to say .
uh , that's a bad one , 
they , uh , 
looks like we're going to have an income tax in texas , 
i hate to see that , 
but you know , if what it's going to take , 
well , you know , we can deduct that from our federal income tax . 
uh , you know , but we need good schools . 
uh , we're more involved in that now . 
and , i think it's better for everybody if we had better schools . 
that's true . 
i would think they could find a better way to fund it though , 
but they haven't for , 
you know , i wish they could have gotten a lottery . 
well , they're struggling with it . 
i think , you know , the lottery could have helped , with that . 
i mean , it wouldn't have been as painful as what we would've paid in state income tax . 
i mean , probably would have paid the same amount 
but , you know , it's not the idea of your paying , uh , income tax . 
i'm not sure there's a positive solution for that . 
it'll be interesting to see what happens . 
trying to think what else is current . 
you know , i haven't seen the news in a couple of days . 
so it , uh , 
i'm a little behind on things . 
well , the other thing i can think of is , uh , what is still going on in iraq 
that's sad . 
two bad situations , 
it begins to make you wonder why we didn't go ahead and go on in and ,
but i understand why bush , you know , doesn't want to go in and uh , take sides . 
i mean , because that would definitely look like another korea , 
 and he'd have all these people jumping down his back , even though i'd agree with it . 
i think he should've gone in there and blew them away . 
seems to have helped him though ,
yeah , it , 
he did a real good job i believe . 
i have , uh , inlaws that live in saudi arabia that stayed there during all of it too . 
 uh , it , uh , you know , 
so we kept very much abreast of what was going on . 
in any of the areas where they , 
they were just north of it .
uh , and they stayed active was uh , the military there . taking supplies out to them in the desert . 
it was a new situation . 
i'll bet . 
i don't really have much more to say .
i don't know anything else that's current other than the weather 
you're right , 
and that's awful in texas .
have you all been getting rain storms down there ? 
and today's just been real drizzly . 
we did last night . uh , some real massive thunderstorms . 
apparently , i don't know if it was just the strong winds or some small tornadoes up this way too . 
caused some damage . 
it did ? 
we may get some more tonight . 
oh , well . we've just got slight chances of rain . 
but , uh , we had the hard thunderstorms the other morning . 
course while everybody was getting ready to go to work . making nice traffic jams . 
so  , 
well the ground here is so flat , 
and it's all saturated now , 
we're getting some flooding . 
uh , when was it , last week , we had all the rain ? 
but , uh , 
i think we had about eight inches . 
it was between six and eight inches here where we are . 
and , uh , you walk out on the ground , 
i mean you , 
i mean , it's awful . 
it's just so soggy . 
it's a lot more humid down that way . 
in fact , miserable . 
well , today i mean , the air was just so sticky , so damp . 
i think there were places around downtown fort worth last night they got three inches in a real short period of time , like an hour or so just ,
well , i guess that's it .
well it's , 
that's about as much as we can do with current events . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
good talking to you , michelle . 
all right . 
the public school systems , well everybody's has known they've needed renovation for years , but never really had a clear direction on which way to go with it . 
the first direction that i would love to see them go with . 
kids learn at different rates 
and for too long they've kind of lumped everybody together . 
you'd learn at this rate 
and that's the only way it's going to happen . 
that's true .
you've got some kids that'll pick up on it in the first three minutes you're talking about it , 
and the other fiftyseven minutes you've been talking about a subject , you've bored them . 
that's very true . 
um , i guess i can relate to that , because i have two kids that are opposites like that . 
 uh , one picks up real quick 
and the other one doesn't . 
and you're right , they do get bored , uh , really fast , if they already know what you're talking about . 
what do you propose that they do ? 
what is your suggestions ? 
the educators need to be a little bit more open minded as well as innovative in dealing with , uh , the various students to get the maximum potential out of the person . 
out of each child . 
out of each child . 
each individual child . 
some kids are going to be great with mechanical stuff . 
other kids are going to be really into math , 
some are really going to be heavy into reading . 
instead of pushing the scales too far either direction , i mean it's great to be well rounded and be exposed to all this stuff . 
but why not hit the points the kid's really interested in ? 
because if he's interested , he's going to study it , 
and he's going to learn it , 
and he's going to remember it . 
that's true . 
i think the only thing that they would argue about that , is that , you know , every child needs to learn every subject . 
i mean , that might be the only thing . 
but , i mean , i definitely agree with you . uh , 
they need exposure to every subject . 
they don't need to be masters of it , 
that's true . uh , 
everything i learned about ancient rome has not helped me anywhere in ,
i definitely agree . 
there's no doubt about that . 
 i'm going to college right now , 
and i feel like , i mean , i'm taking this history class . 
and , i mean , it's so boring , 
and i just hate it . 
i mean , what does this have to do with getting , you know , a computer science degree or whatever , you know ? 
what type of history class is it that you're having to take ? 
uh , american history . 
we have to take , um , like this is like early seventeen hundreds through , i don't know , i think like mid eighteen hundreds . 
and then we have to take another one that's mid eighteen hundreds on up , to basically present . 
well , the early ones they could actually combine two , 
combine that into one . and then from eighteen sixtyfive to present , 
and make that your second step because ,
well that's , 
but even then they're skimming over , 
they're almost trivial with it . 
oh , yes . 
i agree . 
you know , i mean , if they really wanted to get to the meat of the matter , i mean , they make all these people out to be , oh , 
they were great men , 
and they're the father of the country and all this . 
he had just as much dirt on him as anybody else . 
if not more . 
the man was not a saint . 
that's true , 
any way , this , um , school system thing , 
i tell you , i saw something on the news , oh , i don't know , maybe two weeks ago . 
and they were talking about , 
i don't know where you're from , 
but i'm from the dallas area . 
and they were talking about the plano school system , that , they had one school that , uh , if the students did something wrong , i mean , whether it was behavioral or , uh , you know , they weren't learning properly or something . they took these students and put them basically in a closet . with no windows . 
they had , a table , or not a table , but a desk in this closet , 
and they had to sit in there by themselves . 
well , how is that helping my child , you know . 
and , uh , the thing , you know , 
and this helps them to think . 
 but a lot of kids , 
i mean , if a child has , uh , claustrophobia , i mean , that's just going to terrify him , you know 
if the isolation concept really works that good , why are our prisons overcrowded ? 
 uh , that's true . 
but , no , 
i mean , they were , uh , i mean , 
i definitely agree with parents . 
i think that is a very wrong way to handle , uh , disciplining a child . 
putting them in , i mean , they called them their quiet rooms or their isolation rooms . 
they didn't call them closets . 
but they showed these rooms uh , you know , on the news 
and , i mean , they looked like a closet to me . you know , with a desk in it , real small . 
but they said that one of the solutions they came up with was to take the doors off of these isolation rooms . 
i mean , either way . you know , i definitely had to disagree with that . 
i think you know , discipline a child by putting him in a closet .
as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev , the public school system i want to see changed too . 
when i was brought up , if you crossed the line and you broke a rule bad enough , you were going to get spanked . 
well , then the extreme came in , 
and now we can no longer ,
so we now isolate them . 
uh  , 
we've swung the pendulum both ways . 
let's find a middle ground . 
there has to be some sort of discipline , 
and there has to be some sort of punishment .
let's put him into a situation where , okay , you crossed the line , you broke the rule , you're going to have to pay for it . 
but , it's going to tax you physically . 
i don't , 
have them pick up around the school yard , have them weed a flower bed somewhere on the school yar . do something to beautify the school property . 
that's true . 
but you cut , you know , 
the kid's having to give up his , quote , play time to pay his debt for what he did wrong . 
but he's seeing something constructive come out of it . 
um , i have to , 
i think discipline , okay ? 
but , okay , 
for instance , one of the things they do at , uh , my kids school , uh , they have what they call , uh , caught being good slips . 
and when the kids are in halls and stuff , and if they're being really good , i mean , just being excellent , they're not , you know , cutting up and so on . 
they're just standing in line , doing whatever they are supposed to , 
they get one of these caught being good slips . 
and then , when they collect them at the end of each week , they get to go to this little , what they call their caught being good store , 
and then they get to spend these like money . 
well , see , to me , that's positive reinforcement , is much better than trying to find ways to discipline kids , because they're going to be good and try and earn those things , you know , to get the positive part of it . 
i mean , they'd much rather go in the store and buy something than be spanked . 
so , they're definitely going to work towards being good , you know , rather than trying to act up and be bad , you know . 
i think that not only applies inside the public school system , but in society itself . 
there's been too much negative reinforcement . 
how much , like , the caught being good slips . 
how about , just the john q citizen out there on the street ? 
well that's true . i think , really though , 
i mean , that's one thing that , i mean , my kids definitely get spanked when they need to be spanked . 
but i really do try to use positive , uh , reinforcement with them at home , also . 
and it really helps . 
and i mean , they don't get spanked very often , 
but they do when they deserve it , you know . 
but , uh , i don't think any kid should be exempt from being spanked . 
 i mean , i think i wouldn't mind if a teacher spanked my child . 
but , you know , that's just my personal opinion , 
and that's not going to , 
i mean , i don't think that law will ever change . 
they are never going to let a teacher spank a child again . 
but i don't think , 
i mean , some kids don't get don't get spanked at home 
and some kids need to be spanked at home . 
 i mean , don't you think ? 
 but i don't know . 
i mean , there's a point of over kill , 
but somewhere you've got to find an even line . 
but there are times when a child needs to be spanked . 
i mean , they do things that they need that . 
need that shock effect , where they equate the shock of being spanked with the actions they did to get spanked . 
um , i guess my task . 
i usually ride my bike . 
i have , uh , a stationary bike and , uh , a regular bike . 
and when i can , i like to ride my regular bike outside , because it's so much nicer . 
the stationary bike is so , uh , 
 but i have head phones , 
plus i have it , uh , in the living room 
so i either watch t v ,
so i watch the fish , you know . whatever i can do to keep myself occupied . 
 i like to have the t v on , because that usually keeps me , um , more occupied . 
it kind of takes the time away 
and i don't realize , that's really the only time i ever watch t v , is when i'm on the bike . 
 and then usually after i'm done riding the bike , just to cool myself down , i usually take a walk , you know , 
and that just kind of uh , gets me , you know , to where i'm not quite as tired i guess . 
 but it's definitely a task . 
you think so ? 
i can't say that i really enjoy it . 
 i wish that i did enjoy it more , 
but i do it because i have to not because i want to .
i bought a stationary bike , 
but i find that if i sit on that seat too long , it hurts . 
and i haven't figured how to get that soft , 
and i tried even tying a pillow to it . 
but two years ago , well , it's not quite two years , it's almost two years , i joined the cosmopolitan lady here in plano . 
and i love it . 
i just love it . 
so is it just women that go there ? 
see , i think that's what's my biggest problem with going to a health club . 
because i don't feel like having a bunch of other people watch me exercise . 
 you know , so i have tried to just do stuff at home 
and , uh , i just feel conscious about it . 
i mean , i'm not big , you know , or anything , 
but i still don't like other people watching me . 
i like to be able to sweat , have my hair a mess .
and my bathing suit's just one piece , 
so there's no big deal all the way around , 
and it's a total free relaxation . 
because , hey , you can do what you want . 
you're a female , 
and no one is staring at anybody else or worrying about what anything else is doing . 
that's what , 
and they've got such fantastic equipment in there . 
oh , yeah . 
 and i love the water aerobics . 
do they have a pool 
or what is , 
oh , yeah . 
they have two types of water aerobics . 
they call it aqua exercise , i guess is what they call it . 
i've heard that that's really good for you to do . 
it pushes you because you're pushing against the water 
so it is like double strenuous . 
but you're not being double strenuous on your own body . 
because you're pushing it yourself . 
so you're doing it yourself . 
when you're in the water ? 
i end up having to quit for a while . 
but i get blisters on my toes on the bottom because , 
 oh , wow . .
well , that's funny , 
i never would have thought of that . 
well , a lot of people wear those little , uh , terry cloth with rubber soles on the bottom . especially around the pool . 
so they just 
like wat , 
is that , 
oh , okay , 
no big deal one way or the other . 
huh , that's really funny .
 but , i never think about it until after you go there for about a week , your toes , you start getting blisters anyway . 
so no big deal . 
huh , that's , 
but it's fun . 
so , how often do find yourself going ? 
um , if you're doing it on a regular basis , how often do you go ? 
i try to make it at least three times a week . 
that's really , 
for a while i was doing it every day . just ,
i wish that i could make myself exercise every day . 
but i do force myself to do it at least three times a week . which i don't feel like is enough , 
but it's at least something . 
 you know , it , 
i have to force myself to do it , like i said , because to me , i really don't enjoy it . 
but i know that i have to do it . 
i mean it's not a question of whether i want to , you know . 
when i was working up at , uh , the summit ,
and i'd be at the swimming pool by four o'clock .
oh , that's , 
so i was there by four thirty , every night . 
and the only thing that ever bothered me was my hair getting wet . 
because no matter what i did or how i did it , i invariably got myself wet . 
but the water only comes up basically anywhere from your waist to your , oh , chest , i'd say . 
so i mean , it's your choice where you want to go , 
did you ever , 
well , i'm sorry .
that's okay . 
uh , did you ever go to texins at all when you were working for t i ? 
did you 
so i'm very limited what i do . 
 oh , okay . 
it's like i can walk , 
but if i walk for more than fifteen minutes it's going to bother me . 
especially when you're on cement or anything that's hard , 
it will bother me . 
then that would , 
it will bother me . 
i went in there strictly to strengthen my back muscles . 
she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor . 
she says in fact you get more . 
i said , okay , because i'm not a swimmer . 
i like water . 
i'm not scared of it . 
but i couldn't , 
i guess i could swim across the pool , 
but i'm no swimmer per se . 
but i found that this worked really well . 
and i came out of there 
and i saw my stomach going down well . 
i dropped , oh , i'd say almost twenty pounds .
and they fix you up with a diet , which worked real good . 
what if you're already on one ? 
i mean , 
a diet ? 
oh , no , 
see uh , when this one down here opened up , i joined as a v i p . 
and the v i p a computerized diet . 
and they go over all your health and all your history , 
and they show you everything to do , and how to do it , and the whole nine yards . 
so it became part of the package , 
so i went through it . 
it worked out well . 
 but they have packages where they just offer the exercise program . 
is that what you're saying ? 
oh , yeah . 
i see , 
i just went and took the , because they were offering it as an opening benefit , 
so it's less than what you pay now for going in there ,
so it's like when i got laid off , 
i went back in there , and start all over again because it had been a while since i'd done it . 
so i get all the same treatment again . 
so it's kind of nice . 
like i said , i like it . 
i like the heat . 
i like the , 
i jump out of the swimming pool , 
and i go into the hot tub . 
and i love it . 
that would be really nice .
because i have never , 
i think i have gone home maybe once or twice slightly sore . 
but that's because of my physical condition and nothing to do what they did . 
i knew i was pushing too far . 
but usually , when i go into the hot tub before i go swimming , or when i come out , i'm totally relaxed when i go home . 
it's no big deal . 
so you really do enjoy your exercise then , since your , 
it's fun . 
uh , i've gotten on the bike . 
and they've got , uh , the stepping bike , where you step . 
 and i've enjoyed that , watching how well i can walk up and down stairs . 
that's , you know , 
 but most of the others to me are very dull . 
but i got talked into the bike instead . 
and i don't know , 
i really wanted a stepper . 
i'm considering maybe even buying one of those too . 
but i'm not sure if i'll get benefit out of both of them . 
i mean , i don't know if it would really do any good having both of them . 
which one do you feel is better , since you use them both ? 
 um , i get bored very easily . 
uh , the one nice thing about the bicycle is you just sit . 
like you said , you can sit and do it , and watch the t v and not even really be conscious of what you are doing . 
with the stepper , you are conscious of what you are doing because you're basically watching each step as it gets harder and down . 
so you have a you know , little , 
you can program the one at cosmopolitan lady so ,
uh , i , 
it would depend upon which one you want . 
i think now that i've had the bicycle , 
i would go to the stepper . 
but if i were you , i would go apply to either a health club or one of the others and use it for a while . 
because you can buy a month's membership .
oh , really ? 
because it all depends , you know , for everyone their own what they want to do . 
because i jump on the bike here at home . 
mine has see , the handle bars go up and down , 
so i can sit there and read and listen to music , like what you said , 
and it has no effect on me . 
so i mean , it's boring .
do you want to go first ? 
well , you go ahead . 
well , i'm going to tell you what i'd have .
down in the south , we have a lot of shrimp ,
and i have , uh , shrimp that is steamed in beer , that 
oh , yeah . 
and then i have a cauliflower that i would cook , garlic bread , green salad , tea , 
and we'd have a lemon pie for dessert . 
oh , it sounds fantastic . 
and what's really neat about it is , the shrimp is cooked in uh , like your rice steamer , 
 oh , yeah . 
and , um , you place the shrimp in the rice steamer , 
and you put a bay leaf and put some , uh , red pepper over it . 
now , you can either use , you know , the kind that comes in the little can 
or you can just get some , you know , regular red peppers . 
is it cayenne pepper , you mean ? 
uhhuh . 
and you put a little bit of that over it . 
now if you use the dried kind ?
and you put that in there , 
and then you pour two bottles of beer over it . 
and how much shrimp would you use ? 
two pounds . 
two pounds , 
that's the jumbo shrimp in the shells . 
oh , yeah . 
leave the shells on them so they won't just roll up . 
and you pour the beer over the top of it , 
and you cover it . 
and you only cook it until the mixture begins to boil ,
then you remove it , 
and you put it on a platter . 
and then you serve it with melted butter . 
and , uh , i usually put garlic powder in mine . 
oh , yeah . 
and they can just dip it , 
and they shell it as they eat it . 
but , uh , then uh , the cauliflower , you ,
and what you do is , you just , uh , wash it , 
and you core it .
a glass dish . 
uhhuh . 
but it's got to have one that has a cover on it . 
and you , uh , put about two tablespoons of , uh , water into this bowl , and about an eighth a teaspoon of salt . 
and then you just set your cauliflower in there , 
 and then you cook it for seven minutes on high . 
and you rotate it one time . 
and are you cooking the whole head 
i see . 
and , uh , you just set it in there , 
and you microwave it on high for seven minutes , 
and you turn it one time . 
and while that's cooking , i take about a cup of mayonnaise , and a teaspoon of mustard , and some garlic powder , 
and i mix it all together . 
and i shred up some just regular white cheese . 
and after that's cooked , you take it out and pour this on top of it , 
and then you sprinkle the cheese on top of that . 
and you cook it for another three minutes on high , you know , 
oh , that sounds fantastic . 
it is good . 
but it looks , 
i mean , like what i usually do is , i'll like sit the cauliflower in the middle , 
and then i put the , uh , shrimp around the outside of it ,
 um , um . 
and then i have a green salad that i put around the outside of that . 
and , you know , you have all the different seasonings and stuff , 
and then i just fix little individual cups for them . 
and they have the ,
and it makes it a real nice looking ,
 and it's 
but it 
that sounds , 
you look like you went to a whole bunch , 
i bet it tastes good too . 
and , uh , usually i cut those little cherry tomatoes up ,
 oh , yeah . 
and i'll lay those on top of my salad , you know , to make it look nice and things like that . 
now , how many could you serve ? 
uh , it usually serves six . 
i figured about that . 
oh , that's good . 
see out here , we have so many , uh , ethnic people . 
we have italians , 
and we have portuguese , 
and we have russians and polish . 
and it depends , out here , like the type of people you're going to entertain , you know ? 
so it's hard , uh , 
the group that you're going to entertain for that particular time . 
and , uh , they're big on finger food here , too . you know , chicken wings and , uh , ribs , and that kind of stuff .
have you ever had crawfish ? 
uh , no , 
oh . you ought to try some crawfish . 
they are good . 
but see , that's one good thing about living down here is , usually anybody that comes over , you know , even if it's like , out of town guests and stuff , they want our cooking . 
oh , of course . 
you know , 
because , just like now , especially crawfish , it is starting to move out , you know , 
and more and more people are beginning to find out how good it is . 
is it like shrimp ? 
it's similar . 
it's not 
i mean , it's got a taste of its own , you know , 
but it is , 
 oh , it does ? 
um , i can't even think of what you , 
i guess uh , and a lobster . 
because it's small like that 
and it's got the pinchers like a crab . 
 oh , yeah . 
and we call them mud bugs .
but , i mean , they're fantastic tasting . 
they are so good . 
it's the season for them right now . 
and where did you say you were from ? 
louisiana . 
oh , well , do you do cajun cooking ? 
oh , yeah . 
oh , i love , uh , blackened , you know , uh , the fish and the chicken and that kind of stuff . 
oh! we have a few places up here that do that . 
and if ever i see it on the menu , i always get it . 
it is so good .
you know , 
now how do they do the blackened ? 
you buy it as a seasoning . 
but , uh , do you have to have a certain skillet ,
i cook mine , well , do you have uh , like a black iron skillet ? 
i don't have it now . 
but i have mostly teflon . 
oh , okay . 
you now , 
but i don't know . 
you know , i never have . 
i use , uh , uh , the black iron skillet to cook mine . 
does it have to get extremely hot ? 
but it doesn't burn or anything like that . 
the blackening is really the seasoning . 
i mean , there is , 
 oh , oh , 
you know , i mean , that is a seasoning . 
it's not like you would have to cook it for an extreme amount of time , or something like that , to get it , 
oh , i see . 
because , uh , what it's called is , blackening magic . 
and it , it comes in a bottle , 
and , uh , 
it's got a picture of dom de luise on it . 
oh , really ? 
now you would cook it for the same amount of time as you would , prepare it any other time ? 
is that what you're saying ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , oh , that is so good . delicious . 
but you know , you do have to have it hot when you cook it . i mean , 
it does have to be really hot , you know , when you put it in . 
but it's not like it's burned , 
and what blackens it , is the seasoning . 
and it is so good . 
it is . 
i love it . 
in fact i was in texas for a little while . 
and i liked , uh , the barbecues and the mexican food . 
i have a passion for all that type of different tastes . 
because i have been brought up mostly italian american food . 
because my , uh , parents are italian and portuguese . 
so we cook a lot of pasta , and , uh , gravies , and pizzas , and , you know , roasts , and that kind of thing . 
that's why i enjoy going to restaurants and you know , trying different things . 
well , have you ever thought about coming to louisiana , you know , to visit ? 
i would love to . 
you ought ,
um , you don't even have to go all the way to new orleans , you know , if you want to really get some good food . 
i mean , you don't have to go that far south . 
but , uh , of course , the further south you go , the better the food is , as far as i'm concerned . 
is that right ? 
and fact is , we're going to take a vacation this year . 
we're going to go to new orleans , again . 
and , uh , we're only going down there for the food , though .
now , where do you go when you go there ? uh , right on basin street and those places ? 
uh , yeah . 
and , uh , i have some friends that live down there . 
and so , usually we don't go to the tourist ones . 
we go to the ones that they tell us to go to , you know . 
oh , i see . 
and we went to this one , 
it was called the back porch . 
and , uh , they were cooking the stuff , you know , while we went on this boat ride . 
and then we came back and ate , out on this , it was like a back porch .
and , uh , 
 oh , that's nice . 
of course now , when you go down there , you know , i mean , they've got just , 
there's no where you can miss . 
i have never gone to a restaurant , and not just been so full , 
it's unreal . 
i mean , it's so good . 
the seasoning it's just unreal . 
and don't they make a lot of , um , 
i'm trying to think what they call their soup . 
i don't know . 
gumbo . 
no , gumbo . 
gumbo , 
right . 
is that with seafood ? 
oh , you can ? 
that looks good too . 
i've seen the chefs on t v do that ? 
and oh , it looks delicious . 
and i'll tell you what . 
see we do , um , uh , a thing , we call it a sea bake . 
 uh , you take clams , 
well , you , 
do you have any pets ? 
two cats . 
and , uh , um , 
you know , my family had cats when we were growing up the whole time until my mom developed an allergies , 
so , i mean , i'm used to having cats around , 
i like them . 
i like having or pets around in general 
i favor dogs over cats actually 
oh , see , uh , i'm not a dog person at all .
oh , i'm a dog person . 
i had , 
i guess it depends on what you had when he were a kid , right ? .
i was allergic to dogs when i was a kid ,
i may still be , 
um , we , 
but not cats . 
 that   , um , 
i wonder sometimes .
um , but um , my wife's boss a couple weeks ago 
and , um , uh , he has a dog and everything , 
you know , we were sitting the dog and everything 
and , uh , i felt like just miserable all weekend 
and it really didn't dawn on me until sunday , 
the thing i don't like about dogs sometimes is that the house will just reek ,
well , dogs are real high maintenances , 
you got to take them for walks 
and you've got to pay a lot , you know , 
you need to pay attention to cats and everything 
but it's not quite the same thing . 
that's true . 
um , and , um , um , you know , you know , cats , yeah , you don't have to let them outside ,  you know , 
all  cats are indoor cats , 
so , you know , you're not worried about them running allaround the neighborhood 
and , you know , they make their mess in the cat pan which is , 
you know , it's a pain to clean 
but , you know , we used to , 
i mean , they got great stuff out now for cleaning cats'  pans  .
they didn't , 
oh , really ? 
well , you know , when i was growing up i had a clean the cat pan all the time , 
and i hated it because i had to carry everything upstairs take the stuff out and put it in the toilet and everything 
it was really terrible . 
but now you get these liners ,
 and you , you know the , 
oh , that sounds so easy , what i did , 
the cats do it in there , 
you pull it and take it out and throw it away , 
and that's it , .
i housesat  from  cats for a friend of mine which she was finishing up her thesis , 
and what we used to do was just put , um , newspaper on the bottom and then put cat litter 
and then i would just take the whole thing to the garbage can and dump the whole thing . 
same idea .
then i would do it , you know , everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very , very rarely , 
and so it wasn't so bad . 
oh , okay , 
i see . 
  two cats and  just as easy  
it just never started smelling , 
i would put just a little bit of cat litter in there ,
 , all of her animals that she ever had were adopted . 
i that true , 
she's got one dog now and the two cats 
and her dog there is basically a reject , 
somebody had bought him ,
it was her ex boyfriend and , you know , just was not mature enough to keep the dog , didn't realize how much work it was 
and now ,
and she's just so kindhearted that she just takes all the animals 
but i think that for me , well , my husband just has completely nixed the idea of having a dog or a cat .
because that's all there is to it . 
so , you know , 
so , you don't have anything right now ? 
oh , except the kid , 
 huh , that's   , 
now we have a kid 
but he was , no , completely against having a dog or cat , 
and they're harder to get rid of for the weekend , .
uh , i don't know because the cats pretty much , um , 
we can leave them for a weekend as long as we put plenty of food out , 
and , um , uh , it's not a big deal really , 
i mean they're happier when we're around 
but , you know , they're pretty much okay by themselves , 
um , and you know , we couldn't do that with a dog . 
that's , uh , yeah , really true . 
but like other friends of mine have cats , 
they have four of them , 
and if they go away , they hire a pet sitter to come in twice a day and pet them and things like that 
and their cats , you know , they're so used to the attention , that if they don't get it , they get really upset , 
 well   , that's , 
and , you know , they sort of cause trouble around the house and things like that . 
 um ,  , figured something having ,   
so i tried to have a goldfish , 
and , um , i killed that one within a very short amount of time . 
 but  they're not that much fun , you know , 
you can't take them for a walk , 
you can't , you know , 
they can't fetch , you know , 
they can't do anything , 
so i've never , 
i think we had fish when i was a kid 
but i don't , 
my brother had fish when i was a kid 
i remember that , 
and one of his fish jumped out of the , um , gosh , what do you call it , fish tank . and fried itself ,  , on the radiator behind the dresser . 
i'll never forget that 
because i remember my brother ,
and one of the fish was missing 
and they couldn't find it anyplace , 
they couldn't figure out what had happened 
and then they found it fried on ,  , the radiator behind . 
  it was not gross , 
i didn't see it 
but , um , 
trying to remember we had a dog for a while , 
and i don't know if we got rid of the dog 
because my brother was allergic to it , 
my brother had asthma and some allergies which i think he's outgrown now , 
but because of that we didn't have very many pets afterwards 
and then he had fish . 
and you , 
like you say , they're not the most exciting pet to have . 
it's like , 
i don't know , 
what the attraction , 
i mean , you know , they're pretty and everything 
but i've just never seen the attraction of having fish . 
it's not as much fun . 
well , a friend of mine had , um , an eel , 
 , an eel ? 
and then he had a , um , 
i forget what type of fish it was , 
it was one of these fish that it ate a big other fish and things like that . 
 there would be sort of   moby  fish in a tank . 
oh , now we really get sick .
and it , 
i couldn't see having fish like that . 
i could see having , maybe some of the tropical fish , that are really , really pretty 
like ,  i remember  a friend of mine at work telling me that at his frat in college that they had a tank of piranha ,
these aren't cats ,  , you know , 
this is gross . 
that would be , 
what did they do , everyone come around and watch them . 
i mean , i guess that's fine if you have a mouse problem at your frat house ,
well , a cat will do the same trick .
 let's see   , 
i had a pet rat ,  , for a while , 
and it was a live rat , 
and , um , this woman just offered  it to me  while i was in graduate school 
 i had a friend  in col , 
um , i forget how she got it , 
but um , it was the same kind of a deal 
i think she got it , 
i think she was a psych major 
and she got it from the psych department . 
 yeah   , 
mine had been a 
how did this work , 
a mill rat had been bought 
and they had  misclassed  the sex of    back there  
and so , um , she asked me if i want  one of those  babies , 
and i took the baby 
and i got her when she was , you know , just this tiniest little thing like ,
and then she grew to be , you know , 
i had pictures of her when she would sit on my hand 
and then she grew to be pretty big ,
i don't know how much , 
and i had her for over two years 
and she was very affectionate . 
she would , you know , crawl on me 
and she would sit like on my neck or my shoulder while i was working ,
oh , yeah , 
i mean , you know , if you get them young and everything before they go , kind of  nuts , 
so  .
rats are not my favorite animals in the world , 
but i could see getting one from birth and everything . 
sort of weird for me to have had one too 
but there , 
it was a convenient little pet to have because it stayed in its cage 
and , you know , it was easy . 
i have friends with hamsters and gerbils 
and they tell me the same thing . 
i just , 
again it gets into  vivant  much fun ,  , you know what , i guess they can be . 
actually it was more fun than you would think . yeah , starting from the beginning 
but , um , 
we also live in the city now , actually in manhattan . 
and so it's almost impossible to , 
it's not fair to a pet to have a pet here ,
i mean , people do , 
oh people , 
but it's not , 
i don't , oh , 
plus , i mean , the pooper scooper  one  new york , 
 so , you know  .
oh , yeah , 
you see all yeah , these stately people , and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them , 
it's really kind of funny . 
yeah ,  uh   , 
i was living in northern jersey when that  law  came through , remember hearing all about it , 
we were wondering if uh , they had any special law for the horses in central park . 
 i should make you   , 
of course , not . 
they have , um , the bags behind them 
but i think they're actually supposed to ,
 hit  the bags . 
but , oh , gosh , i can't even walk by central park  yeah  when summertime , 
just the smell is so bad  ,
oh , god , i can't , 
last time i was there was fall so probably wasn't that bad .
oh , well , it's not that long ago . 
 it was   ,
not this past fall 
but i mean fall ,
i mean , yeah , it was almost like october of eightyfive , 
i think was the last time i was up there and at center park . 
um , i had a friend who went to colombia 
and i used to go up and visit her . 
um , so , 
that's not too far from were we live , 
you said you had two cats , 
 um , just what you call it , are they breed cats or anything 
or are they just , 
my wife got them from , uh , um , friend of hers at work and everything , you know , you know , as kittens , 
and i mean , this was before we even met . 
um , she's had them for a couple years . 
and um , you know , they're really cute , 
they're sisters , 
one of them is a lot bigger than the other one 
and ,  , she pushes the other one away from the food . 
apparently i don't know all the details 
but they were born around christmas because one of them is named tinsel 
and the other one is named holly . 
you know , the scr , 
they're both females ? 
and the front claws . 
and why didn't it work last time ? .
well , i'm all for it . 
well , i am too . 
i wish , uh , it had started a long time ago , is the problem , because we're so wound up 
and i guess , they tried what'd the call it , soft conversion and hard conversion 
they tried the , 
one of them is where you just take whatever's already standard 
and you give it some sort of a weird metric number like six point two eight seven instead of six millimeter . 
direct conversion . 
i don't know . uh . 
i think they uh , just go all the way on new products introduced or whatever , you know , start your packaging , go to liters instead of quarts , 
and you know , people if they have to are going to learn to think that way . 
well doesn't just about everything now have both metric and english . 
but things are generally packaged in the english sized packages , you know . 
you buy a quart of milk , 
and sure it has the metric equivalent written on there , 
but it still a quart . 
oh , yeah , 
but if they started putting it in liters , of oil , and you know , liters of gasoline , people are going to learn to think in metric . 
as long as you can still buy a product in the english units , that's how you're going to think of it . 
i kind of remember back when gas prices started up , you know , pretty dramatically when they started getting toward a dollar a gallon range , 
somebody had , uh , 
i believe it was exxon 
it figures . 
we were living in lubbock at the time , 
they started marketing it in liters , 
and it was only like twentynine and thirty cents a liter . 
and nobody had any idea what a liter was , 
so , uh . 
that's the problem . 
when we finally out that liters was about a quart , there's about four liters in a gallon 
so you can figure out what you're actually paying for it . 
it's kind of hard for me to believe that this day and age , 
i don't know , 
when i was growing up , we were talking metric system in school .
but by the time i was in fifth or sixth grade anyway . 
i would expect people with any kind of buying power you know , under the age of thirty or so , to have some idea what it is , anyway . 
a liter's about a quart . 
 uh , i think maybe there's where the problem came in , you know . 
we've tried to , instead of learning , 
it's kind of like learning a language , you know , 
when you learn one from the other , you always end up in this conversion thing all the time . 
so , you , 
it's almost like , uh , 
course this country isn't a dictatorship , 
but , uh , 
well , thing is , it's a global market place these days , 
and , you know , we're like , what , one of two backwards countries in the world , as far as , 
i read that , what uganda and , 
i don't remember what the other one is 
there's one or two others that just , 
it's just time i think for us to go over . 
because all you end up doing is if you're in business or you're in any kind of international  , 
i don't , you know , 
i work for t i , 
we're all around the world , 
you have to 
yeah , uh , i , 
and one of the things that we've run into a problem , 
course you're familiar with any drawing system 
mils and microns . 
and then you end up with a decimal , where you start getting into mils , and that sort of thing . 
and then some of them are done in , you know , purely metric . 
i remember that stink came around in the design area a few years back when it was all overseas designs were in microns 
and ours were in mils . 
and it got to , you know , 
somewhere down the line they went standardized , 
they went microns , 
but , uh , you know , you end up with all kinds of problems with converting your designs . 
oh , i can imagine . 
uh , the one that , uh , uh , 
have you ever lived in a country where they use metric . 
i was with t i in el salvador for a while , 
and i had to get used to , you know , purely metric system down there , because they didn't understand anything else . 
so , i had a little bit of experience with it , 
and also i noticed in canada uh , you drop a quarter , fifty cents , whatever , in a coke machine up there , 
and you get this funny looking coke , you know , 
it's in a can that's taller but not as big around . 
you know , i guess that's some 
about half a liter . 
it's not a liter , 
it's like a half a liter or something like that . 
it's a strange looking can . 
but my daughter in law's from panama , 
and they have had americans down there for so long , you know , that they're kind of into both systems , 
but , uh , she gets real confused on distances 
and temperature is the big thing 
i would have 
well , i had kind of gotten used to centigrade temperature , you know , 
if it's between zero and ten , it's cold , 
and if it's ten and twenty it's not too bad , 
if it's between twenty and thirty it's pretty warm , 
it's getting warm , right . 
if it's more than thirty it's just hotter than all get out . 
you know , between a hundred , if you're talking about a hundred degrees or what , thirty , zero , you know thirty four degrees , whatever that is . 
you know , you don't get all the little differences 
it's about . 
 you know , the differences between seventy and seventytwo or seventyfive degrees isn't much , 
but the difference thirty and thirtyfive degrees is , quite a bit . 
is about twice as much , what it works out to . 
one point eight times as many 
something like that . 
so . i think as long as people have a choice , they're going to stick with the american way . 
and until we have to learn to think that way , we won't . 
though we call it the english system , 
but i'm not sure what they do in england now . 
except they've got a , 
now , okay , we run into some problems once , 
i remember , they've got a nut and bolts system called wentworth . 
and this thing was even different than , you know , s a e standards and stuff . 
this , ca , 
my dad bought one of these little nash metropolitans here quite a few years back , 
and the thing had a austin heeley type engine , you know , 
it was austin motors engine and running gear . 
and the body was built by nash , 
or who , you know , 
that was even before american motors , 
but nash , essentially , in the u s somewhere . 
and that thing had the darndest combination of metric and wentworth and , uh , s a e . 
he ended up with about three sets of tools 
he just get one more   .
because i think the wentworth and the s a e bolt sizes were the same , 
but the threads were different , 
and , uh 
oh , that would be a mess . 
and on my chevy van that's a couple of years old . 
part of it's built in canada . 
matter of fact , the thing is , i always say it's built off shore , you know , because it was assembled in canada . 
the only thing that was in it built in the u s was the , uh , differential , 
and it was built in buffalo , new york . 
but it's got the hardest combination of , uh , metric 
and , most of the body parts seem to be metric , 
and most of the engine parts seem to be s a e , 
so . it's just crazy . 
it just gets bad , 
now , you got to have one , and not mix them up . 
because you're never going to get to got a mix . 
and of course , here that would involve changing road signs all across the country , you know , miles per hour to kilometers per hour , and the whole nine yards . 
kind of hard to do gradually . 
i thought maybe they would convert to , uh , metric back when they went to the fiftyfive mile an hour speed limit , because what is it 
and you know 
hell , you'd have people doing a hundred miles an hour . 
you'd have , 
hundreds on the sign looks lot better than fifty five , 
you'd have people going , you're right , a hundred miles an hour . 
and , so . i don't know , 
i'd kind of , 
and the other thing , too , is , you know , between here and el paso's , what , five hundred miles , 
but it's almost eight hundred kilometers , you know . 
that'd sure seems like a long way . 
but they'd seem to be ticking off faster , too . 
i guess that's it . 
well they converted all the road signs to fiftyfive miles an hour , you know , 
they could've converted it to metric just about as easy . 
i think they , 
you got the problem with all your cars are still , 
you still got cars on the road that don't have both . 
at that time , anyway , that was still when things were , 
the metric system was still not , 
not all that common . 
you know , now cars , they have both . 
sooner or later they'll start putting the miles on the inside and the kilometers in big numbers so people start thinking that way . 
i know the only other place that i was ever at where they really had it mixed in miles per hour 
and some are in kilometers . 
and you got to know where you are 
uh , so , jack , what type of music do you like ? 
well , i like , uh , classical ,
i enjoy classical too . 
i never really had listened to it till i got married , 
 and my wife , uh , enjoys it . 
so i had never listened to it till then , 
but now i listen to it well , whenever she does . 
and even every once in a while i put it on myself , you know . 
i used to play the piano , 
and i like , uh , bach and ,
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah , 
see those are really nice . 
i like those . 
though i couldn't tell you anything about them other than when my wife says , this is bach , you know . 
well , i don't know all that much myself , 
i just know ,
that you w , 
what you like . 
how about popular music ? 
uh , whatsever's on the radio is usually okay with me , 
it's mostly just the tunes . 
i'm pretty much the same way . 
i know . 
there's well , you know , 
i just thought they just all sort of rhymed , you know . 
i know , 
i know . 
about the only thing i can remember after the song is over is the refrain . 
that , whenever they say it two or three times . 
i'm the same way .
it's funny , uh , depending on where you live , 
i commute back and forth between baltimore and a rural town called salisbury ,
and the difference in the radio with popular music ,
oh , really ? 
and as soon as you go down to salisbury , this town that's , you know , uh , two and a half hours away in the suburbs or whatever , uh , in a real rural uh , maryland ,
and they don't , you know . 
oldies or what ? 
but classic rock , you know , with , 
 you know , like when the doors movie came out , you know , doors was really on the radio there ,
oh , yeah , 
so , it was sort of a funny thing . 
there's a big variation among the country , 
i mean , if you ,
i'm starting to realize that . 
i never really thought about that much , 
but there is . 
yeah , 
i never , 
i lived in pittsburgh before baltimore , 
and i never really noticed the difference when i moved to this area ? 
i really didn't notice at all . 
it just seemed the same . 
but when i went more rural , you know , it really changed . 
chicago has a lot of good stations , uh , 
oh , does it ? 
now , you don't have to wait till the hour mark . 
it's sort of constant . 
you just turn there , 
and , uh , you get the latest news and everything . 
uh , it's sort of like c n n , you know , 
you turn on your t v 
and it's on . 
boy , that would really be beneficial . 
so , yeah . 
because you never hear the news basically on the radio . 
i never get it . 
you know , and if you don't read the paper , you sort of fall behind if you're in ,
that's pretty good . 
i like to listen to tapes , uh , of music or , 
and , um , now you can even get books on tape , um . 
on fact , uh , my grandmother does that a lot ,
or she's losing her sight or whatever . 
that , in , 
i can imagine , you know , if you're driving cross country ,
lot of the classics are really ,
so , that's a lot of fun 
that would be good . 
i guess so . 
but i guess music comes into that whole aspect of listening .
but if you do have to go something , i guess we can just cut off . 
well , jack , it was nice to talk to you . 
nice talking to you , tom . 
 and good luck , 
and i hope you get some more calls and make some more calls . 
all right . 
thank you . 
bye , bye . 
why don't you tell me about yours . 
i live in plano , in a four bedroom , two bath house , which is the area's dominantly three bedroom , two bath . 
so , i'm just a little bit different than typical , uh , 
and of course , the plano area is basically with alleyways , 
so everything around here is set up that way . which i think is a little bit different than most areas , in the houses , the way they're constructed . 
and it's a brick house , with , uh , some wood . 
it's real nice , 
i like it .
how about you ? 
well i certainly hope so . 
we have a classic ranch , up in denton . 
ranch style home , i would hate to think that anybody thought , uh , the lot we live on as a ranch . 
uh , it's in a subdivision and one story . 
it started out life as a three bedroom house , and now has no two car garage and has , uh , the two extra rooms enclosed . 
i suppose we still only have three effective bedrooms 
but we gained a playroom for the kids and an office out of enclosing the garage . 
are most of the houses in your area three bedroom , two bath ? 
i can't think of any four bedroom houses in the subdivision . 
ours is probably the closest to it . 
you know how realtors are , 
if you had two people that don't have any clothes it could be a five bedroom house , 
 to  .
don't need a closet .
the only thing about mine , um , i think there's probably about , oh , when i go down the street i can just pick out houses that are identical to mine 
and usually they are the four bedroom , um , 
but they're spaced out , oh i'd say maybe three , on a two block period . 
because it's all different builders up here . 
so it's kind of hard at that point to , you know , classify some of the builders . 
but most of the builders all built three , two . 
but the one thing , my house is a little bit different 
and i can pick it out again because it's not typical , 
i've got the , oh , what do you call a , uh , double ceiling , double high in one half of the house . 
so like the den and the living room are all double cathedral ceilings . 
uh , cathedral ceilings . 
and , uh , the kitchen is norm 
and the bedrooms are norm . 
so it just goes down the dining room , the family room , and the living room that way . 
and i love the space . 
it's , uh , 
luckily i came from a house in colorado which had the cathedral ceiling 
and i just lucked out and walked into this one 
and of course i felt the same airy feeling , which i liked it real well , 
so it's a nice thing to move into , 
but , again , it's not typical in this area . 
you can just spot them because much higher . 
but , uh , 
well i hadn't thought about it in that sense , of the high roofs . 
we have cathedral ceilings in , uh , two rooms . in the , uh , family room and in the master bedroom 
and those are pleasant . 
well it's like when my son goes up into the furnace area over the garage . 
he can walk 
and he's six foot . 
i'm not going up there , 
but he says there's plenty of room up there for a room . 
so that means if i knock out the wall in my family room , i could make another room overlooking my family room from upstairs with no problem . 
but , um , i'm not that ambitious . 
i tol , 
maybe someday when i feel really ambitious and get angry i'll start poking holes up there , but until that time .
but , uh , i've noticed the houses around here uh , with three bedrooms . 
and we're 
probably a hundred percent of them all are mostly brick , uh , with some wood . 
but it's basically all brick . 
the next subdivision over from me is total brick 
and the one on the other side of me is about the same as mine . 
but , uh , the one on opposite the street now , they're total brick 
and they're basically almost all three , two . 
they're all three , two . 
but of course they have a little river going down their area too , which is kind of nice .
if it's the kind of river i'm thinking of , better than us , you know .
are you talking about a real river , creek ? 
they've put little fountains in and such . 
well that's nice . 
uh , i came from mississippi recently 
and the rivers that we had there were the ones that came with the rains 
and they didn't pay any attention to banks and that kind of stuff . 
so you're just as likely to wake up and discover you're in two inches of water . 
do you have i mean a lot of yard around your house now , in denton ? 
uh , it's a third of an acre . 
i don't think that's a lot , uh , 
in fact , i have been real disappointed in the six years that i've lived out here about lot sizes .
i'm more accustomed to a one acre lot being a standard and the two acre being what most people have . 
when you get down closer in to the newer tract homes you find almost like there's no lot line at all . 
they're built practically on top of each other . 
that's true . 
i know , i was , 
while there are some advantages to that , there's less time spent outside making it look nice and taking care of things . 
uh , i just feel hemmed in by that . 
it's not as comfortable a living for me . 
well this subdivision here has got , 
oh , there's enough to put , oh , i'd say , uh , twelve feet between each house on each side . 
well , i've got more on one side than i've got on the other , 
but i'm like you , 
i came down from colorado 
and there was more land up there around a yard with a big full back yard , which here , i look out my back yard and i can see the gate . 
i mean the fence is right there , 
i mean just don't run too fast , 
or you'll hit it 
and i'm not used to that either . 
i mean i could see people putting swimming pools in the back yard all around me , 
but to me , you put the swimming pool in your back yard 
and you've lost your back yard . 
i mean , uh , sure , 
i mean you've got a little place on one side or the other , 
but , uh , to me they're not that big enough for a pool , 
but , you know , they're going up , 
uh , it's great for mowing .
from that aspect , you're right . 
 and it doesn't take nearly as long to get out there and weed it by hand and that kind of stuff . 
but yes , 
i'm used to , uh , walking out the back yard 
and you can play catch across the back yard 
and you've got plenty of room to even play a small game of baseball , but , don't do it around here . 
the one , 
that's sort of what drove me to denton  ,
i started looking 
and it seemed like the further i got away from dallas , center , uh , the more lot came with the house and the lower the price , at the same time . 
and it just seemed like there was a ten thousand dollar drop for each city . 
i hadn't thought about it that way . 
so moving up thirtyfive , i stopped when i got to denton . uh . 
it ju , 
well see now , with our jobs mainly hitting downtown dallas we couldn't go too much further , 
but , we went that way . 
it was the schools and the cost of houses , 
so we kept going out until we figured we hit a point where we need the traffic , time to get into work , 
and that's where we stopped . 
it was the same problem . 
but i think plano's , 
you all both work downtown ? 
oh , well , this is a wonderful thing that you're doing here still helping them out . 
oh , i ye , 
uh , but you were working downtown . 
my exhusband was working downtown . 
but uh , no , t i as far as i concerned , they've been great as far as layoffs is concerned , 
so i have no problems . 
but as far as the housing , personally , i would like to move out of a four bedroom house and go with something smaller . 
but prices in plano , um , there isn't a section in plano you can really move to without getting caught 
and , uh , my price right now , for what i pay , 
i do 
however  , there are solutions to it . 
 and foremost , uh , where we compare that we are now doing fifty percent of our , uh , people are voting . 
uh , we're probably making a comparison against , uh , some european uh , 
uh , so , uh , uh , one of the reasons that it is lower in the united states is that mostly we hold it on tuesdays . 
god knows why we hold it on tuesdays . 
what  . . . 
to the polls in any case . if they , uh , have to work late into the evening and not get up . 
my solution 
oh , really , 
they hold it on the weekends ? 
in america that is not true because a great number of people work on sundays . 
 well , uh  . . . 
 but that is one of my solutions . uh  . . . 
 uh , a real long period of time that you can absentee vote before the elections . 
and i do not think they have seen a really high 
have you absentee 
 well , i have absentee voted in , uh , new hampshire , 
and it is a fairly complicated process where you have to go 
 oh , really . 
i do not say that it is that complicated , 
but part of the process also is that you must preregister at some particular point . 
new hampshire is fairly easy 
but other states 
to absentee vote specifically ? 
so registrations are perhaps a problem also . 
and we're the mobile society , uh , 
people are always mo , you know , 
one out of every seven people moves every year . 
 uh , that is almost a fourteen percent turnover every ,
if you compound 
if it is difficult to register to vote , that would remove your eligibility to vote . 
but i do not think it is difficult enough to prevent people who are motivated in the first place ,
i mean , and the people that i have talked to  . . . 
 well maybe that is another factor  , the motivational factor . 
the motivational factor is probably  . . . 
i think that is the biggest one . 
i  . . . 
that's the biggest problem . 
i  . . . 
 well  , that's diminished by , 
wwe have noticed this in particular . 
i , just read two books , 
one of them is whose stars and stripes now ? 
the , uh , trivial pursuit of the presidency in nineteen eightyeight . 
 oh , really  ? 
it's a fairly decent book . 
i mean 
uh , wake me up when it's over was about the eightyfour elections . 
and i forget what the other books were  , 
but any case , uh , iiit is , uh , uh , the mar , 
uh , uh , there was , uh , 
blue smoke and mirrors was the one in eightytwo . 
uh , these guys , uh , have taken the place of theodore white on reporting elections . 
in any case , they say that , uh , there's a definite trend , uh , well , you know , toward candidates using negative voting . 
it is the only way that you can use television effectively . 
i don't understand that . 
 uh , is that just because they have such a low opinion of the public ? and the public's , uh  ,
no  , 
and , you know , 
and put some sensational thing before the public , as mike dukakis learned in the last campaign , 
and it is not refuted , 
people will , you know , uh , believe it . 
if you don't refute it , as he didn't , there must be some truth 
 well , he did refute it . 
 , he refuted it , 
it just was not effective enough to  . . . 
 well , he didn't refute it til the last two weeks of the campaign . 
he didn't believe anybody would believe that . 
 and indeed his trend started upward . 
 well i didn't believe anybody would believe that either . 
i guess i 
 well , they do . 
 well , don't give too much credit to the american public for their motivational ability .
 and it  . . . 
well , then how can a democracy work then ? 
 well , it , uh , 
well , i don't know . 
how can it work ? 
is it working ? 
i mean that's the question . 
i guess the question also that we discovered , is that they don't throw rascals out . 
everybody seems 
but they don't throw the rascal out , their own rascal . 
uh , an economic incentive for people to vote . 
that sounds rather crass , i think , because 
i mean , you know , you would take a certain amount off their income tax or property tax or whatever . 
 but  , it would be very difficult to administer because i am sure that any time money and votes are involved , 
 the whole thing 
when i have heard about england's elections , they are allowed to run for what , a total of six or eight weeks . even for the higher offices in the land . 
what if we totally just severely limited the campaigns so money wasn't so much of an issue ? 
i feel like ,  ,
but the idea is to get the individual to the polls , aaand we have to make it as easy as possible for him to get to the polls .
  , i don't care how easy it is for them , 
i do not think they are going to because they do no think that anybody listens to their vote . 
they think whoever has the b . 
they really think that the packs , you know , no matter what you're promised during a campaign , 
and these days we are promised hardly anything of substance . 
 oh , you mean the special interest groups ? 
which isn't very much , specif , 
they do not promise anything specific these days . 
but whatever you are promised , they just reverse themselves depending on who pays them what once they get into office . 
 i mean , i think that's the  . . . 
and yet bush did that . 
 i mean , but 
generally , people , i've read polls now where they've excused him because there was a definite necessity to balance the budget . 
well , then why did he say that during his campaign ? 
 oh , he gave it , 
he did 
then he , 
it was totally irr  . . . 
and he is the president 
and he should address those problems 
and if there needs to be a change in a period of time . 
what was so funny about it is that , i guess , that it happened so rapidly , you know . 
he knew it . 
and being 
and maybe 
well  . . . 
but i think it is , errr , 
i mean , 
and he is motivated because we happen to be the cradle of liberty and all that . 
i think voters are motivated , uh  . . . 
what about voters in the other countries that you were talking about ? 
like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts ? and , well , the newer democracies 
because it's going to be totally different , 
 well , i don't know if they have higher turnouts 
you do not think so  ? 
i don't think england has , 
i think england has about a seventy percent , sixtyfive percent turn out . 
i think that we just discovered 
uh , just , it more violent every year . 
they went down almost fifty percent in this election before they blew up 
 oh , really ? 
talk about the turnout relative to the eligible voter , right ? 
i mean is , 
a great deal of our population , uh , mainly the blacks in the south and the 
now everybody is available . 
 so , if you really computed it , they probably 
when we said we had a seventy percent turnout in nineteen fifty , we really only had a fifty percent turnout 
because all the eligible 
 oh , i see , 
because , right . 
weren't qual , 
 you know , it was skewed 
 were disqualified .
 but isn't that kind of a blanket racist kind of thing to say the blacks and hispanics and other minorities just don't vote ? 
or is that just the truth ? 
i don't know about hispanics , you know . 
i just , 
i mean , i think in this sort of 
well  . . .
but you know that just made me think of something that happened down here in dallas last year . 
they have this huge fight going over redistricting here . 
and at one point they took another vote on it , 
and to pass their plan . 
and this is something that had been going on for months . 
it was on the news every night . 
 and they have had lawsuits over it . 
i mean , it was a major issue , 
and there still wasn't enough minority vote to pass the plan that they were backing . 
so that's , 
you know , i think that you have really hit on something there . 
to say that , uh , those  . . . 
what do you mean ? 
well , with the minorities and we are saying we have lower voter turnout . 
maybe it is , uh , now that we have minorities included in the  . . . 
my last , uh , auto repair was my , uh , alternator went out . 
i have a nineteen eightysix toyota , uh , 
it's a little tercel .
and , uh , i have a friend who's real good with , uh , repairing cars 
so i got him to take the alternator off and take it and , uh , you know , get a replacement part . 
so we went to a place called quality auto parts 
and everything 
and they're , uh , very reasonable . 
so , uh , i bought the alternator , 
we put it on the car 
and it didn't work , 
and it blew out all the fuses . 
oh , no .
how much was the alternator ? 
uh , i bel , something like sixtynine dollars , something on that order . 
wiring wrong ? 
just didn't fit the car , 
so . i took it back 
and , uh , in the parts shop took the alternator 
and he put it on the little thing he has in there to test them 
and , uh , he said there was nothing wrong with the alternator 
so we went back and tried it again , put it on again 
and it still didn't work , 
and we took the car up to , um , a little place called pep boys , 
i don't know if you have them in your area 
 but , uh , they're pretty reasonable , uh , car repair place also . 
so , uh , towed it up there because it , you know , wouldn't start or anything 
and this thing just kept blowing out the fuses and , uh , took them about what was blowing the fuse , 
and it was the alternator that was blowing the fuse . 
anyway , ended up taking it to the toyota dealer 
and the only problem was that , uh , it had to be a genuine toyota , uh , alternator because most of the other ones that they say will fit it , that , you know , they sit in there and everything 
but there's just some little difference that , um , causes it not to work an i , 
they probably built that in so they could make money . 
i guess so 
and that was my last experience . 
well i had a weird , 
there's a little sensing device , uh , fan , 
it's an air conditioner sensing device . 
i don't know why , 
it actually , 
there's a metal piece that fits through the belts , uh , 
and somehow that broke off 
and , uh , i still can't figure out how it broke , 
and , uh , anyway , so this piece obviously , um , 
i have a subaru , 
and , uh , i think you can only get it through subaru dealer , etcetera , 
uh , this little sensing device costed like sixty bucks .
are you able , 
and i haven't had too many problems with my car , 
i got a eightyeight subaru , g l x t 
and it , 
uh , and then , you know just basic maintenance and oil changes 
 and i do not do my oil changes 
and i will not do my oil changes . 
 i think the first time i tried to do one and ended up , um , trying to ge , uh , 
yo , borrowed somebody else's jack 
and i did this 
and i went and bought everything , 
so after buying the filter and all the oil , you're looking at ten bucks at least ,
so that's , um , you know , 
as far as any maintenance on my car , i shy away from the oil changes , 
that's for sure . 
well my car uh , it's an eightysix 
and i really hadn't had until that 
and the car now has a hundred and thirty something thousand miles on it 
 uh , and this was just recent , 
so i really can't complain about this one . 
how did you put that many miles on it , in ,
um , well , i used , 
it was a seventy mile trip everyday , you know , two ways was seventy miles . 
oh , a hundred and forty mile trip ? 
oh , thirtyfive miles each way . 
yeah . 
and , uh , i did that for about three years 
and it really added up . 
i've only taken , uh , maybe two trips that were about four hours long uh , down to shreveport . 
and , uh , the rest of it you know , it's just basically driving a long ways to work . 
and now i drive like twentythree miles each way , 
so , i'm getting uh , little relief , 
but still i drive a long ways . 
but i guess because they're highway miles , you know , it's not so bad on your car as if it , you know , were just regular street , you know . 
do you work for t i ? 
do you ? 
and i get these green , 
i don't know what you want to call them , fake 
and , uh , i just wondering how i go about getting the cash .
uh , there's a number that you call , 
it's the same number that you call to make a call . 
oh , okay . 
you call that number 
 and , uh , somehow or another they'll give you an option to leave a message 
and you can leave a message . 
i know someone that did that , 
you leave a message 
and they'll call you back . 
all right , 
well that's good to know . 
i haven't been doing 
this is the first time i've been called in a long time 
and i haven't been doing it 
oh really . 
and , uh , i've done it maybe twelve times . 
well i don't know if i've done it quite that much , 
but , uh , mine is mixed up too , 
i have to call and get it fixed .
uh , let's see before i had this car um , i bought an audi five thousand 
 but i bought it used . 
give him for it for a tradein , 
and , uh , it had a whole lot of miles on it . 
i figured maybe i'd get one or two years out of it , 
an i did get a couple of good years out of it 
and uh , the engine messed up on me 
and then i gave it to a guy to repair who works for the audi dealer 
and , uh , he took the engine apart 
and , you know , he just said he couldn't fix it 
so the engine never got put back together again . 
huh , oh well . 
i was driving a sixtysix plymouth fury . 
i think those old cars 
i don't know , i , 
the body was in good condition 
and   you know , it ran fine . 
it was starting to burn some oil . 
um , but i had to  , you know , ge , 
you know , couple of months after i was out of college i finally splurged and bought my car 
i read a book one time that said that the best cars were made before seventyfour . 
well , you know , these cars made in the sixties and stuff , 
i mean i mean , the thickness , 
i mean , 
you just don't see cars like that . 
and they last a long time . 
and they were simple too , 
the engines were simple and durable 
i guess it's still easy to find engines for those cars , engines and transmissions 
and changing them out you can keep a car for a long time . 
course i guess i could do the same thing with the toyota that i have , 
i just don't know how much they'll want to charge me to , 
it almost costs so much to fix anything or do anything with it , 
you're just better off buying another car . 
i guess so , 
but i just think they cost too much in the first place , now a days . 
uh , actually my last vacation was in connecticut . 
uh , we went home to visit family . 
before that we were in hawaii . 
oh , well actually i did visit hawaii once 
but i never made it off of oahu ,
it wasn't actually . 
oahu , uh , i couldn't wait to get off .
we took a cruise 
and we went to four different islands 
and it was really nice , 
kauai was nice and maui was nice . 
we had a great time . 
we were there for ten days . 
oh that's , 
yeah , 
so where have you been ? 
oh i've been lots of places . 
my last vacation was actually in morocco i guess 
  that one would count   , 
uh , that was about a year and a half ago , 
no kidding . 
an , what , did you just decide to go there 
and we were living in france at the time 
 and we decided that i've never been to africa 
and i needed to get that continent  since  i  ,
and actually it's a fairly common vacation place for french people to go 
and they speak french 
and it just seemed like it would be a fun place to go . 
oh i'm sure it was wonderful . 
we had about , a little bit less than two weeks . 
and as always , it seems a bit , uh , rushed . 
we do a lot of traveling around . 
we rented a car and drove pretty much everywhere . 
was it hot ? 
it was , 
well we were there in the winter .
i was born in saudi arabia 
and , uh , 
but i was very young 
so i don't remember that 
 excuse me , at what age did you , 
oh , that's too bad 
so i don't remember 
but we have all these wonderful pictures of all these great places that they have been  , 
and that was when i was a baby 
because that area of the world i think would be great . 
it was a very interesting vacation . 
the only thing i didn't like was in some of the more touristy areas 
and there were some places ,
there would be kids there that were excellent at ripping you off , 
and we had nothing taken because we knew 
and we had things in inside pockets and you know , in jacket underneath a coat type of thing . 
we found that in jamaica . 
it was the same way ,
but they were so destitute 
and i guess they make all their money on tourism 
if you want to buy different things 
and really , after awhile it really gets annoying , 
you know , it's a little scary too when they're coming up and they're all over you . 
the worst place was in marrakech 
 and the other cities it wasn't nearly as bad 
and a couple of them it was , what we did in some of the other cities 
and they tell you to do that is to hire a local guide 
it doesn't matter who it is 
and they keep everyone else away from you . 
oh really . 
and it's worth it 
and it's like ten dollars a day or something 
and its worth it just to keep everyone else away from badgering you 
 and you feel stupid doing that 
but we did it , 
and we were much happier , 
and you also get in to see things that you might not get into 
well that's great . 
where else have you been ? 
uh  , 
well you lived in france , 
so you've been all through europe . 
uh , we're going to go for a conference in september 
and so , hopefully , we'll get to travel a little bit too . 
uh , my more exciting spots have been , 
i've been to the galapagos islands . 
if you don't like wildlife it's probably not of interest .
but that was really , really fabulous 
and just the photos i have of it and gosh , incredible and be so close , 
now when was that , when were you there ? 
um , august , eightyeight . 
and then , actually , after there i went to um , hawaii , 
a lot of my travel has been sort of based around conferences or business meetings 
 and so , i went to hawaii and then to australia 
did you go on the barrier re , 
did you see the great barrier reef and go snorkeling ? 
i'm a diver 
and so , 
oh diving . 
 but , uh , 
i drove from sidney down to melbourne and over to adelaide . 
it's gorgeous , absolutely gorgeous . 
the coastline was just incredible . 
it's huge . 
is it really ? 
yeah , 
uh , but , 
did you have shrimp ? 
i've seen in , you know , 
and great big prawns , you know the big shrimp 
i don't remember if i had shrimp . 
didn't have shrimp there huh  ? 
i remember food .
 oh , i like that too . 
but , uh , in fact i didn't eat out that much there because i was traveling by myself in a car , 
it would have been , i think , much more fun to do it like in the van ,
but , uh , 
oh you're adventurous . 
you went by yourself . 
and i was by myself in china too . 
oh wow . 
china was a little bit more , uh , of a challenge . 
but , it wasn't more of a challenge in a sense because i hired a guide all the time , 
and so i never , you know , got out by myself , or not much , 
was it very expensive ? 
maybe it was about a thousand dollars , maybe a little bit less , 
i don't really remember , for ten days including all my meals , a guide , a car , the airfare 
you're kidding! 
no kidding! 
because i was already in hong kong 
um , but it only cost you about a thousand dollars to go there 
and i went to beijing , shanghai , chengdu 
and actually then i took a train up from shanghai to a little , quingdao i think is the name of it . 
it's a little , uh , sort of getaway retreat village not far from shanghai . 
it's just a train ride . 
and that , 
i had yeah , two internal plane flights and a couple of other things . 
it was really , 
all for a thousand dollars ? 
that really surprises me . 
around a thousand . 
and i didn't stay in the top of the line hotels 
but i stayed in , 
they were all completely clean , 
and , you know , they were newly built 
and they were sort of the lower end of the top of the line , hotels ,
and you don't want to stay in the very exclusive ,
uh , but 
that was , 
 i highly recommend that way to go . 
if you're ever interested in going the route , i dealt with this woman , 
her name was rita at china tours in boston .
oh really . 
and she just gave me this woman's name to contact 
and it would really be fun , i think ideally with like two couples because you have a car and a driver 
and then , 
well i grew up out in the country and , uh , was used to having , uh , guns around the place 
and , uh , 
i think i'm kind of bent towards middle liberal of the bridge myself . 
you know , i have quite a collection myself 
and , you know , i'm a good hunter 
and i started hunting when i was twelve years old . 
of course , my parents made me take hunters safety classes 
but i don't want them to completely turn loose of their controls either 
well i feel that its , uh , 
i think uh , about if you outlaw guns , 
only outlaws will have guns then . 
i believe that . 
and i believe that too because the person that is wanting to ,
and it's the honest citizens like ourselves that are responsible about use of guns , uh , 
we can handle it 
but there's an element that can't . 
and our police departments and our d e a agents and everything have to carry automatic weapons 
because everybody that's in drug trafficking has got them . 
they have got them outgunned . 
you know . yeah . 
there was ten millimeter automatic pistol for the f b i 
it had , held like a fifteen shot clip ,
that would be , 
 but you figure you got some drug guy out there that's got an uzi machine gun , uh , 
smith and wesson revolver isn't going to do you much good . 
it's sure not . 
i have lived in , uh , illinois at one time 
and they passed a , uh , it wasn't really gun control 
but it was , you had to register as a gun owner , 
you didn't have to list your guns , 
but you had to have this card , 
it was like a driver's license card that you had to have it in order to buy ammunition 
 and that was the first , uh , 
this was twenty years ago . 
but they had that so that they were trying to control it a little bit in that respect . 
 see in california they , 
you have to sign a , you know , 
they take your name and driver's license number , hunting license number and all that good stuff ,
now rifles aren't too bad , 
but , you know , any kind of handgun at all ,
we lived in tennessee for awhile 
and i bought a pistol there 
and there was a fifteen day waiting period . 
you had to fill out an application and ,
gee , that's not a bad idea . 
i think that , uh , you know , a waiting period , uh , 
but again it's going to be the law abiding citizen that's going to comply with that . 
it is . 
so i don't , 
the only way they could do it i think , would be to stiffen the penalties on anybody using a gun . 
you know , i think if we kind of stiffen them up a little bit , course , 
i feel kind of weird about that anyway , 
i think if somebody shoots somebody , they ought to be shot . 
 but , you know . 
but i agree with you there that , uh , 
it would definitely be gun control .
again the purpose of gun control is to control how it is being used 
it's not to keep people from buying a gun that need one for a specific purpose , legal purpose 
and i'm in favor of keeping the illegal guy from getting one in his hands 
well and they're actually a necessity in life , you know . 
 oh yes . 
they're not , you know , 
not everybody needs a gun 
but sooner or later i need one . 
you know , whether i'm out hunting or you know , 
i'm never had to protect my life or , 
well i did in the service but you know , not on the street 
so i don't really need one in the  aspects   , 
you don't have to carry one in your car uh , 
so you know , i use mine for recreation , 
i don't , 
and i enjoyed my guns . 
i have a good time with them 
well i know what , uh , 
i took my kids out and taught them out , how to shoot a gun . 
my wife the same thing , uh , she knows how to shoot any weapon that we have not that i have an arsenal or anything , 
but we have several guns around the house 
one of these days my grandkids probably . 
but i think it's , uh , 
you got to 
living in dallas there's not that many places to go shoot 
if someone gets shot with a ,
i had to explain that to my , 
i've got a six year old now 
and he , you know , 
i have a fifteen year old and a seventeen year old , well 
they understand now . 
you know i've taken time to teach them 
and now the young boy wants to know 
so he started with the b b gun and shot a couple of holes in a couple of windows 
and i took it away from him , 
but at least it was a b b gun not a twentytwo or a four ten or something 
i remember i had an old uncle up by tulsa , oklahoma that took me out and , uh , showed me . 
it was my mother's uncle , 
this was a gentleman in his sixties , 
and he took me out with him and , uh , single shot twentytwo ,
we went squirrel hunting 
all right . 
and , i was probably about twelve at the time , 
and i thought that was the neatest thing 
and he let me shoot and showed me how . 
all right . 
i think there is a lot of responsibility on any of us gun owners to make sure that whoever is around us is at least safe and knows how to use one . 
you know , i don't want to get out there deer hunting and have some guy blow me away , 
well that's about all i , 
we agreed pretty well on this i think . 
i think so . 
well it's been real nice talking with you . 
all right , 
have a good one . 
do you have children ? 
uh , yes , 
do you . 
how old is she ? 
she's only about , uh , uh , a little less than two years old . 
uh , i guess you have not reached the stage where you need to , uh , promote a college or anything , huh . 
i've got one that's seven and one that's three , 
so , uh , we started saving , 
but that's all . 
so , are you planning to , like , encourage your children to go to a particular school ? 
 , no , uh , um , 
no particular school . 
uh , i think that's really a decision that , 
that you are going to let them make . 
you know , that's a big influence , i think and ,
so , uh , you know , you need to go to a school that handles whatever it is you want to do . 
where did you go to school ? 
uh , university of mississippi . 
was that local or , uh , 
uh , well , well , it was within the state . 
but it was not necessarily local , it was , 
but i mean , so what's ,    , 
what's the criterion for choosing to go there ? 
uh , well , at the time , i was , uh , thinking of going pre med 
 and in the state , uh , they had the best pre med uh , curriculum for the , uh , state institutions . 
it was choice between there and , uh , a private college 
at the time , we really could not afford it 
uh , i enjoyed it . 
so did you commute everyday then 
oh , okay . 
oh , okay , 
when you said it was that meant you had to drive like an hour 
    uh , it was like another world . 
basically , no it was a , 
did not get home that often , you know , 
and at that age 
especially , if you have not been away a lot 
so , did you go there , like , straight out of high school ? 
yeah . 
uh , see i did not get my degree until later on , 
so i just finished mine a couple of years ago . 
and , uh , you know , i guess , you know , when you have to do it that way , it makes your choices a lot easier 
uh , that's true . 
my master's 
you know , i was not going to try to pick and go somewhere else 
and i was trying to work . 
you kind of have the luxury of being able to 
which group do you work in in t i ? 
um , uh , the computer science center . 
oh , uh , where is that at ? 
uh , north building . 
i see . 
how long do you work for t i ? 
uh , about three years . 
did you work somewhere else , 
like sounds like you got your master's before here 
uh , yeah , 
actually , i mean i came straight from school to here . 
i see . 
so , cause this was the first real job after getting my degree . 
after your master's or after your , 
after my master's . 
i see . 
my undergraduate degree was not in what my master's was . 
i see . 
so i made a career change 
i see . 
well , let's see 
i , have not   you know , 
there's a lot of pluses and minuses for different schools , you know , just like you said . 
uh , depending on what they want to specialize in and what you can afford , different things like that , 
so i have not 
 one day  i would like to , uh , you know , the , uh , 
i like the school where i went . 
i mean , and i would not hesitate at all 
or the school where i got my master's at , which was a different school . 
and , uh , i liked it almost as well . 
uh , but , uh , you know , that , i'm not going to hold them to that 
i , you know , think that's 
if they want to , that's fine , but 
um , because you went there . 
i didn't know that . 
well certain schools do it . 
this school does . 
so , uh , 
i was involved in some , uh , oh , alumnae recruiting , uh , here in town , uh , recently , uh , well last year .
uh , and it was kind of fun , because you are trying to get people interested in your school , you know . 
and they were , 
this was a college night at a high school in richardson . 
and it was , 
and there were a bunch of kids , you know , and a bunch of schools . 
there were a hundred schools , probably there 
it's kind of interesting to talk up , you know , your ,
your own school , 
and , i was surprised by the number of kids that came by and had heard of , you know , our school .
uh , you know , we , uh ,   
situations like that , you don't realize , you know , until you start thinking about it , the kinds of   advantages you school may have over others . 
and so , real pleased with that . 
that worked out so well . 
so did you drum up any interest  then  
i don't know offhand 
but , uh , it seemed like there were quite a few 
 so , there , 
 and that , 
and she was wanting some more information . 
but dru , a majorette or something . 
 and how good her daughter was . 
she had cards printed up , actually 
oh , really . 
and she had these business cards she was passing out 
and it was quite a production . 
i think some parents go a little bit overboard . 
it sounds like it . 
well you know i think richardson is probably you know one of the places that would definitely 
and i don't have elderly parents , yet but not that far in the distant future . 
what about yourself ? 
well , my parents are both in their seventies . 
my mother and stepfather , and my father and stepmother are all in their seventies . 
and , my , uh , uh , father and stepmother are not in very good health . 
so this is something that is , 
a concern of yours right now . 
are they living independently , right now ? 
have you looked at any homes for them or talked to them about that ? 
its got a lot of bedrooms and bathrooms 
and , uh , they all share the same kitchen and dining room and den and kitchen . 
 uh , my stepfather bought this thinking of a time when one or the other of them might need care 
and they felt like that would be their alternative to a nursing home . 
oh , that sounds the ultimate . 
unless they were so ill that they needed nursing care that could not be given in the home . 
well , even at that point , most care can be given in the home . 
that sound like just an excellent solution . 
you must feel real good about that . 
uh , i read a lot 
and then i know people then have visited nursing homes and , uh , have had great , grandparents in the nursing homes 
and it was not a happy situation for any of them . 
that has , uh , activities going all the time 
and they have , uh , 
even the people that are wheelchair bound incapacitated .
and they make their crafts and sell them at a big fair that's held annually at a big mall here .
you know , a lot of activities going on all the time 
and this is a nursing home , 
it's not a senior citizens home . 
so that the people are really , uh , 
really in need of a nursing home . 
they need , 
 but it's a very expensive solution . 
well , it's , you know , 
i think we just , you know , listen to , the fact that there are good solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes . 
it's just a matter of finding ,
able to afford either of those solutions . 
and that , i think is what is scary , 
and i also feel that that's where some of the bad images of nursing homes come from . is when people have to put people in a nursing homes 
and they really can not afford the best . 
and that's right , well i took my husband one night to an emergency room when he was in an emergency situation 
and , uh , they brought in a very elderly man from a nursing home who had , uh , apparently inhaled some chicken he was eating . 
and , uh , he apparently had not been in the home too long , just a week or so , 
but when the family came in to see him , they had not been made aware , 
i was in the room when the emergency technicians brought him in from the ambulance 
and i overheard their conversation . 
and when the family walked in , his wife and daughter and soninlaw , they were not even aware of what had happened . 
oh , goodness . 
so , i told them he strangled on some chicken 
and , uh , the wife said he was not even supposed to be eating any food like that that would require chewing or ,
and i thought  , 
what a shame , 
they put him in the home so that he could be cared for 
 and then they could have done that well at home . 
 and then she was upset , 
he had on two different shoes , one of which was not even his . 
he had on a pair ,
you hear these stories ,
well , this was just something that i was , 
you happened , 
and , uh , at no point did anybody from the nursing home come in . 
and we were there in the same room with the man for a half hour .
and , with just a curtain , of course , between us and , uh , 
revived the man and cleared out his airway and so forth , 
and he was definitely , 
just by looking at him and the way he acted , you could tell he was in need of nursing home care , 
but the family were all talking about , uh , putting him in another home . 
they said he will not go back 
well , good . 
i'm glad they have a solution .
i'm glad they the option . 
i know . 
i would hate to be in a position where that was all i could afford 
and there was no choice . 
uh , my exhusband's grandmother had been in a nursing home now for , oh , it must be seven , eight years , 
 uh , and , uh , 
 oh , my . 
as the situation is so sad because it just takes all the dignity away from , 
like this was a really neat vital woman 
and you get in a nursing home 
and the first thing that happens you have to share your whole living space ,
and  oh  i do not know what the answer is , 
but i do know that there are some wonderful places out there 
and i think it does , 
a lot of it goes down to just money .
that's right . 
uh , if you , you know , have family that , uh , you can live with . 
visits everyday . 
i really , 
i think the way of selecting a nursing home would be similar to the way you would select child care , you know . 
you would do your research 
and you would go visit . 
visit , 
and , uh , hopefully , they would have it so that you could go there anytime . 
because if you could not go there anytime , then that would make you ,
you know , my grandmother many years ago when she was in a nursing home before she died 
and i guess there was not a name for what she had at that time , 
but i guess alzheimer's would come as close as anything , 
she really was not aware of what she was doing . 
and , uh , i can remember she had several strokes 
and the nursing home was right next to a hospital 
and they would rush her to the hospital and revive her and just bring her back to the nursing home in a couple of days . 
and it was just like keeping something . 
 well , we've talked a little bit about the plano school system . 
um , i really have been pleased with plano . 
i have a child who , uh , 
my son is learning disabled , 
and , uh , i thank god every day that i have the resources that we have tapped into . 
now , is he the elementary school ? 
and he's not severely learning disabled . 
i mean , you know , he just , 
but he is being helped . 
he was in resource from second grade till fourth grade in math , 
and they recently released him from ,
oh , great . 
i really was . 
i just thought that was so neat , that they got him over that hump . 
and , um , he's in the herman method of reading . 
i don't know if you're ,
it is something new , 
and basically what they do is they start right from the beginning relearning the sounds of letters . 
i think i read about that in the paper . 
it's wonderful . 
doctor haggard is heading that up . 
he didn't have a problem with reading . 
as a matter of fact , he's reading on level . 
the problem was his spelling . 
it's interesting , because i'm convinced i have the same learning disability , or had ,
so you learned how to solve your problems on your own . 
that's right . 
 you know , it's not an intelligence problem . 
it's just a problem with learning . 
has he had this since kindergarten , 
or is this something that maybe learning phonetics , 
and then he just didn't learn the right way ? 
well , you know , it's funny . 
with spelling , 
he will be able to , 
you'll say to him , spell cat , 
and then he would go to write it , 
and he would write c o t . 
something is wrong here . 
you're right . 
he's just immature . 
 well , second grade it was , 
i will , 
these teachers as far as i'm concerned are absolute saints , because in second grade , it was about the second week of school , i went up there , 
that's great for parents to be involved . 
well , i was , 
and i went up there the second week of school 
and thank god the head teacher , the team leader , was a special education major . 
oh , how great . 
it was 
so she was able to zero in . 
we think there's a learning disability 
and sure enough , they tested him 
and , you know , he qualified for the help , 
and it's been great , 
i know i have a sister who has the other extreme . 
she has a child in connecticut who is extremely gifted , 
and because of the cutbacks in the economy 
oh , no . 
and to me that's the same thing . 
it's like having a child who has a learning disability that's being ignored ,
but that's something that parents , i think , are able to help the gifted child in the home more than they could help the learning disabled child . 
that's true . 
so , because , 
 but learning disability , unless you are schooled in the types of things and ways to help a child like that , then it makes it real difficult 
 and this to me is the benefit i see in public schools 
and i'm not sure that the private schools or parochial schools address that problem ,
and if they're a behavior problem , they're out . 
that's right . 
i work a nine ten school , 
and we get students that come in that have been kicked out of the , uh , parochial and , uh , private schools 
 and , uh , they come in 
so i really hate that for them . 
but that's , 
well , when comparing test scores , 
i know recently i was in a discussion 
and they were comparing test scores between private schools and public schools , 
and that was one of the points that i made , is that you're not comparing apples to apples . 
that's right . 
but on the other hand , i can't necessarily blame them ,
and they ,
that's right , 
they can be selective , 
and they , 
that's right , 
they have the ability to be selective . 
but you can't say then , well , public schools are not as good . 
perhaps they are , because they're , 
if you choose the select top group out of the public schools and tested them , and then compared them to the private school group , then i think you would have a more equitable 
you're right . 
and i have a problem when they compare the kids in japan or germany to the kids here . 
they have to try out to even get into , to which kindergarten they're going to get into , 
oh , really ? 
and then after , uh , 
and if you only , 
and high school , 
and if they don't , that's the end of their schooling . 
and , uh , they don't ever really go on . 
it's only their top ones that go on , like ours do . 
that creates a problem . 
the other thing is that the priority in the family is that child's education ,
well , you see that with the foreigners that come here . 
that's right . 
um , they had to be the best , 
and they put off all social life , all everything ,
that's right , 
well , is that good ? 
but on the other hand , i feel like my children , who are kind of middle of the road , have , 
better coping skills . 
i think it's real important to have friends . 
i think it's real important to play sports . 
i think it's real important to be part of a team . 
and so that's why i said , their childhood is extremely different from mine . 
we didn't do all that 
we certainly didn't carpool and run the way i do . um , 
well , and you don't see the parents , uh , encouraging those students to get on athletic teams or ,
it's strictly stick to the educational , 
and it's interesting to see them as they get older , uh , then that is the type of adult they are . 
well , this is a very timely topic inasmuch as we're going to a family reunion this weekend . 
oh are you really ? 
where is it going to be ? 
down at lake texoma lodge . 
this is one that's , uh , the baker family reunion 
 and this has been going on uh , i would say , at least twentyfive years or thirty ,
oh , that's
maybe longer than that , i'm going to get back into the fifties sometime . 
first time , i married into the family , 
and the first time i went was about fiftyseven , i think . 
but , uh , this one has been well organized 
and in fact it used to be at lake brownwood , 
and now it's lake texoma , because that's more central location 
i'm sure location's really important as far as figuring out where one ought to be . 
very important , because , uh , you'll start losing people if it's too far to go . 
we have factions , when it's one part , 
 i have one reunion on my mother's side , 
and we found that if it's in a certain part of texas , some people come , 
and if it's elsewhere , other people come 
we never get them at both of them 
never get them at both places , 
it seems like , 
so i think we need to find a new place .
well , listen , uh , they've had this one , 
well it just , 
of course , over the years it has , uh , built up as far as the organization is concerned 
 but now they , uh , have a golf tournament on the saturday . 
and then they have generally a show or an auction or something on saturday night to help raise funds to cover the costs of such . 
oh , that's a neat idea . 
 and , uh , uh , they get the community building there at lake texoma lodge , 
and everyone brings in food 
 and then for the saturday night dinner they bring in like kentucky fried chicken from durant , 
and uh 
how many people , jim , are involved ? 
uh , generally , uh , i think it's been as high as about a hundred and twenty people . 
i think normal's about sixty or seventy . 
well , i guess , um , ours probably isn't that big . 
our family is dwindling , for one thing . 
and i often feel funny because i'm in a branch that's all but died 
i just have one aunt and my family . 
so sometimes when these other families get together , they're really pulling in aunts and uncles and 
and we're kind of off on the sidelines . 
but it does remind us that we have family and roots . 
so we keep going even though we're not a real big part of it . 
well , our family reunion started out my wife 
and i were the kids , the newlyweds , so to speak 
 and now our children go , 
and our grandchildren are going now . 
oh that's great . 
so it's , uh , wound up that , uh , we're the old folks now . 
but , um , they have various organized , 
they have generally a volleyball net set up and horseshoes , uh , to pitch , 
and they organize a baseball game for the kids 
 and several people bring boats , 
and there's a place they take the kids up to the lodge and go swimming up there in the afternoon , 
so there's lots to do . 
some of the people 
and some just come in for saturday 
 so , it , uh , has worked out quite well , 
and it's a chance to see some of the relatives you don't see all year long 
that's true . 
well , that's neat . 
i think they're really fun . 
we go to mine regularly , 
and then we go to my husband's occasionally down in temple , 
and he has a large family , 
so it's fun when we go to that one . 
my side of the family is from back in ohio and west virginia , 
and i think we've been to one in thirtyfive years or something like that , 
that is a problem with the distance . 
the people that we have that don't come are out el paso way 
 and it's just too much for all of them ,
it's an ,
but then we have the same attitude when it's out ,
they're going to have it at fort davis 
 and we thought that would be fun to kind of tie it in as a vacation time 
we have , 
each year , of course , they elect officers of the family reunion 
 and a number of years ago , back in the early eighties , my wife was president . 
we discovered how much work it is just to organize and get it together .
and choose ,
that's correct . 
that's a heavy burden . 
it is , 
i tell you . 
i don't really care for her to be president again . 
 but it's a lot of work , 
but it's a lot of fun . 
we've enjoyed it , 
well , i think , 
and it's good for kids to know that they have other family . 
and this year they're all excited . 
the show this weekend , 
this weekend's going to be a rock and roll show 
oh , boy . 
my two grandsons and one of their cousins are going to dress up and lip sing to a rock song 
oh , what fun . 
so , uh , it's going to be exciting for them , and for us too . 
probably lots of laughs . 
oh , yes , 
there have been some really wild shows put on there . 
they , uh , really get , uh , into it . 
well , it sounds like you really have a good structure and have it going along . 
ours is still kind of loosely organized , 
so , the officer idea is a good idea . 
well we've , uh , had various things over the years , uh , to raise funds for it 
 and again , it's not cheap to rent the lodge up there 
but , uh 
they've tried passing the hat , 
and they've had auctions and various things to raise funds , 
and , uh 
and some people don't .
and it's not fair that everybody not contribute , 
 excuse me . but , um , anyway , that's the family reunion story . 
well , thanks a lot i enjoyed talking to you . 
been nice talking to you . 
all right . 
well , i am , uh , the product of , uh , i think as much the changing roles of women as anyone , 
my mother , uh , 
we come from a , 
my mother and i were , uh , really , first generation divorce in our family . 
my , uh , mother was divorced in nineteen , uh , fiftyseven ,
and , that anyone had ever known , to have a divorce . 
of course , now fifty percent divorces in the united states , uh , 
my mother , uh , was treated very badly , uh , family members , um , especially from my father's side of the family , 
and also , uh , uh , uh , we were , uh , 
and , they all felt that was the cause of the reason for the split up , even though he had impregnated another woman and forced the divorce . 
oh , mercy . 
uh , it was always my mother's fault , she was not , uh , sufficient , you know , she just was not good enough . 
what was wrong with her , was she not attractive enough , did she not take good enough care of her man to keep his interest . 
it was that kind of an attitude . 
that's too bad . 
 so , uh , 
it was too bad , 
it was really rough . 
um , um , that's sad . 
it really is . 
uh , so , you know , that's so changing , 
some of the changing roles of women in that respect , i have been a product of . 
um , i think that there are people i think that , uh , 
i was first generation going to college in my family . 
uh , first , my mother had always had a quote career , but always a career as uh , uh , in a secretarial position . 
she did rise to the highest position that a woman could rise to in a secretarial profession in des moines , iowa . 
that's wonderful . 
she was a secretary federal judge . 
and it was a lifetime appointment for her as well as for him . 
so , that was a really high status position . 
well , that's wonderful . 
she made over thirty thousand ,
that speaks ,
well , yeah , 
she a real hard la , 
she had high standards . 
hard driving lady with a steel rod up her back , you know . 
oh , bless her heart . 
uh , so i went to college and now since have completed two master's degrees 
and i am the director of music in a church . 
um , but it's interestingly enough , i am still , everyday , confronted with , 
challenges that have to do with my sex . 
uh , for instance , uh , well , you know , i am just not taken as seriously , you know , 
and , uh , the choir members treat me differently because i am a woman , they expect me to be more motherly , 
they question my authority more , uh , than they ever would a man . 
and i have experience with this , because i work at both as a director of music and also as an associate under a man . 
so i mean , i am pretty aware of what goes on 
so , basically that's , 
well i am done talking . 
do you want to talk ? .
well , i think that you carried forth your subject matter very well , uh , nickie . 
and i can , uh , relate to that , uh , 
uh , i think it's the image that the woman has and , uh , in the world ,
oh , always . 
and , uh , i think things are changing , 
but the changing is taking a long time longer than we would like it to , 
but we are progressing . 
so , that's the main point is that we are going ahead . 
and , uh , i think that , uh , in the long term that women are going to be able to have the recognition that they deserve . 
and , uh , men , uh , a lot of them have , uh , come around and have seen ,
but there are a lot of diehards out there that will never change . 
so we have to , uh , face that reality also . 
i have never been able to figure out why they can not ever change , why they can not bend . i mean , why they can not just accept , you know , competent women , 
i have never been able to understand that . 
i guess it's fear .
i  mean what   , 
it could be , if they are not sure of themselves . 
the ones that , uh , go along with that , they are sure of themselves . 
and they know that they can , uh , you know , uh , be on the same level . 
and they do not have any , uh , ego , uh , problems that they are fighting . 
and , uh , i think that we are going to be , uh , on par with them 
uh , and what i would like to see happen futuristically ,
and , uh , i think our problems would be fewer ,
men have a lot of trouble with that though . 
they , in their own peer relationships , they do not treat themselves equal , 
and so it's really difficult for them to treat women as equals . 
they are really much more comfortable with somebody being the boss and somebody being the follower . 
uh , it seems that they are more comfortable that way . 
and i do not know if it's a militaristic point of view i guess , you know , 
somebody can not be colonel 
and everybody else is infantry , 
but it's just really interesting to me . 
i am married to a wonderful man ,
i think probably is as enlightened as anyone can be at this particular stage in their life time . 
you know , and i am the slave . 
and it , 
those are the only issues we ever fight about . 
uh , to accept women equally , 
even if they want to , they are more comfortable when somebody is the boss .
uh , dictatorships are real efficient . 
well , i guess we would have to go back to the way that the lord made us . 
and , uh , the women when they are married , they are to be subjective to their husbands . 
and i believe that strongly . 
uh , but i think that they should be in harmony with what they are , with what the subject matter is . 
and i think the issue should be settled before there's a conflict . 
uh , and i think that can happen in a very wonderful way . 
and if we , men and women , would do as the bible said , that we would esteem each other higher than ourselves . 
can you picture that ? 
i mean , if your husband did that to you ,
it's true . 
and , uh , that's really the divine answer ,
so , uh , uh , that would be a beautiful relationship . 
it would be . 
and i think there are some people that have done that , 
and i have seen it . 
and it's just marvelous , 
and i am just in awe to see this , 
i am only twentyeight 
and i haven't had much experience with nursing homes . 
i have never visited any of them 
and , uh , i don't think i've ever even been in one . 
have you ? 
and , uh , we used to g , when we were like in our  teen ages  
we'd go on sundays and visit , you know , the older people . 
but , um , i have an elderly grandma that lives with us . 
and she's lived with us for like five years . 
so i kind of know how to decide if you want to put somebody in a rest home 
or , um , like because she's pretty senile 
and  , 
and it takes a lot of care 
like twentyfour hours a day someone ,
it's rea , 
his grandmother too and they're , her son , his uncle , whatever , you know , anyway . 
he's recently retired 
and so he's the one who she moved in with when she had a stroke 
 and all the other children are working or whatever . 
they're all my parents age . 
uh , so he's got , you know , his retirement though is really twentyfour hours a day . 
they have a day care two days a week . 
they call it senior citizen day care . 
but she goes in the senior citizen center . 
oh , really ? 
so he gets a break two days a week 
but it's only for like two or three hours at a time . 
and , you know , just , you see a lot of things like you know ,   was a great golfer and wanted to play golf when he retired , 
and you know that a lot of the things he thought he would do when he retired he's not able to do now . 
but he refuses to consider any other , 
i don't , 
to put her in a rest home ? 
and is that how your parents feel 
she says that when her husband died put her in a rest home . 
so it's kind of , uh , 
i don't know . 
i mean , i don't think my parents would 
but she is getting pretty bad 
like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed 
and my mom has to take care of her pretty much 
so it gets , 
i don't know . 
it's a hard decision , 
but i don't think i would do it to my parents personally .
i know at this , 
i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either , you know . 
but i really feel bad for the people i see th , not very , 
i'm not really experienced 
but like i said i just have that one family , 
and i just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now 
and , than he thought it would be . 
when he retired ? 
and , uh , he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone . 
it's like that  good  for us just because my uncle and my mom switch off like we have her for three months 
and then he has her for three months . 
oh , well , that's great . 
so that , 
that's a good idea . 
we ought to , 
and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever , i don't know what they're going to do . 
it's really not my family . 
it's my fiancee's 
so i can't say much . 
but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either 
and i wonder , i'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children 
so if my parents do need to live with someone , it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for .
and i , 
that's fine with me . 
my fiancee and i both figure that's what's , we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever . 
if the , 
you know what i mean ? 
we feel like ,
and i feel like i would never put them in a home . 
but i wonder how much , you know , if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something . 
you think about it 
and it's really , 
i don't know . 
this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country . 
you think ? 
 and they really  seem  as wise 
 and in this country nobody really , 
they're seen as senile .
and oh , the oldtimer made with the old way 
and nobody respects the traditions . 
and , you know , it's i , 
i'm not saying that i do either 
and we really don't have any that don't have the social security 
and everything really isn't that much 
you know , even if they're in good health it's incredible . 
they don't have any , 
they don't get special treatment and maybe they should , you know 
i know . 
and so it's kind of a depressing topic though . 
how old are you ? 
um , i'm twenty . 
so yeah , and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother . 
she drives us craz , 
why don't you go ahead and say what you feel , 
and then i'll respond . 
all right . 
well , of not doing my part with recycling , i'm afraid . 
we , um , recently moved here from north carolina , 
and they had curbside recycling , 
and it was very easy you know , to put everything out there , 
but we don't have it at least in our neighborhood right now 
take things where they belong . 
well , how long have you been here ? 
well , we've been here since january , 
but , uh 
so , i guess we're old timers compared to some people . 
i think that's a good excuse . 
you need to get into 
we've been here probably two and a half years , 
and we didn't recycle at all before we came 
 so i think we're doing well . 
we save most of our aluminum cans and glass 
well , where do you take those things ? 
well , the , um , glass and the newspaper we usually take to walmart . 
 um , in behind walmart they have bins 
 and then we usually save up our cans and change them in for money . 
well , where do you do that , 
because we've been saving cans for my daughter's choir 
but i didn't know where to take them . 
um , there's a place on parker road , um , 
it's just over the overpass before you get like to kmart . 
i think there's a service station there . 
there's usually a semi truck that has a person there that will weigh them 
better than nothing , 
 and what i hear a lot of neighborhoods do have the pickup now , 
and hopefully we'll be getting them in the month of october . 
it seems like ever since we've moved here we've been hearing that , you know 
i think it was originally scheduled for february , 
but the trucks that were supposed to do it , there's been some problems with 
 and i can't wait for that , 
that will be easy . 
i get tired of newspaper littering the garage .
it gets to be a bit much to haul it off , 
i feel guilty we don't recycle our milk containers because they seem like a big waste . 
well , they're a lot of bulk , anyway 
they fill up the whole kitchen garbage can 
 so , i'll be glad when the bins do come , 
and i think that's when i'll start doing the plastic , too . 
it was real easy with the bins , 
it really was , 
it was just no effort at all , um , no more trouble than taking out the garbage , 
so , um , 
i've gotten used to washing you know , the , um , salad dressing bottles and 
it's not that big of a deal , 
and it's nicer to just throw them out , 
but we can do our part 
well , how much do you earn on the cans , 
what kind of an idea to give her for , 
oh , when we first oh , a grocery sack full or 
and it would be like two dollars 
so it's gone down . 
yeah , 
which is understandable , 
i think , more people are 
that's something we don't really make any effort to , 
and whatever pop we drink , we used to take the boys out for a bike ride , and pick up the litter , you know , the cans 
 and that was kind of fun , 
but we haven't done that for a long time 
well , that sounds like a pretty good project . 
 well , the boys think it's fun , plus you get your exercise 
and  ,
well , i'll have to keep myself get on it . 
my neighbor across the street , um , is so careful about recycling , 
and so i keep telling myself , i'll get it organized , 
but , and do the city wide first . 
well , hopefully the bins will be here in this month 
and that will spur you on , 
i won't have any excuse then , 
that's for sure . 
all right , well , it sounds like we're doing our part and at least starting ,
thinking about it , anyway .
that's all you can do 
um , yeah , 
they , you know , 
it was good talking to you , 
and maybe we'll get on line again . 
thanks , sherry . 
well , do you have any pets ? 
i have a dog named grisly , who's a ten year old , uh , mixed breed between golden retriever , afghan hound and chow . 
and i have a pair of box turtles . 
i used to have box turtles , um , well , years ago , when i was growing up 
i really like them . 
oh , yeah , 
i do , too . 
lucky and spot , that's their names 
 and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room , 
and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle ,
so do you have any pets now ? 
um , our friends in houston bred the dogs . 
i had never heard of them 
i haven't either . 
 um , they're all white 
and they're small , um , and fluffy , 
they don't shed . 
i guess they're distantly related to a poodle , 
but they're not very well known in this country , 
and they're not , um , high strung or over bred 
and how big do they get . 
ours is , uh , on the small end , 
and she's about ten pounds , 
and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds 
oh , that's interesting . 
 and they love people , um , and kids 
and that was something we were looking for , um , 
our love is golden retrievers , 
and that's what we had intended to get in houston , 
but we had a small yard and a pool 
and knowing how they love to dig 
the water , 
 so , uh , we ended up getting this , 
and , uh , my son would rather have a golden retriever , though , i think 
now he wants a good size dog .
well , we've got a good size dog , 
and we were considering getting a puppy , a small house , lap top dog for him , because he likes other animals and because we used to have a miniature dachshund , 
and i miss 
the kind you have sounds very interesting , though . 
well , um , they're really sweet dogs . 
and bred them . 
they had five litters of puppies , 
 because , um , 
and how do you spell that breed ? 
it's b i c h o n f r i s e . 
f r i s e . 
and how do you pronounce that ? 
bichon frise . 
i'm writing it out phonetically , 
they're , uh , 
and they don't shed 
so with 
and they love people , 
and they're , 
do they bark a lot ? 
um , no , 
um , than some , because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house . 
we used to swap back and forth dogs . 
  they have three dogs . 
they had a cockapoo , and two bichons 
and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there 
 and , uh , now it's funny . 
she's a good watch dog 
 and if there's , she'll bark that way , 
but she also talks a lot , 
and so , if we're leaving her , she barks at us , because 
does she ever mess in the house ? 
the circuses in europe used to use them 
uh , oh , they'll dance 
oh , gee . 
 um , but they're very easy to train 
and about how much are they ? 
well , they range , 
i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper . 
they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars , i think 
and how about the , 
 but , um , because her dogs , um , the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter , 
and , uh , the one male that she used had a tooth problem 
 and so she only bred that dog once because it had 
oh , yes . 
just pets , 
that's what we'd rather have is just a pet , instead of 
we used to show saint bernards when i was a little girl . 
we did that every weekend , 
oh , but , yeah , takes a lot of time . 
and it's very expensive . 
um , but she might have some contacts here , 
i know that the dog's grandmother , um , was from plano , 
oh , that's where i live , 
oh , that's where i live , too . 
i'm at coit and legacy  . . . 
so , what do you think about it ? 
i guess that's so . 
do you feel there's a problem with immigration in america ? 
but they're not really big ones . 
i think that , um , in general the whole immigration policy isn't quite as open as it should be . 
that it's really pretty hard for people from other countries to get in here even if they're educated and will be a good asset to america . 
it's often hard for them to get in and get on the track towards citizenship unless they marry a citizen or something like that . 
that's interesting . 
i was wondering what your response would be . 
i'm a first generation american . 
so i'm ,
uh , where did you come from ? 
so where did your parents come from ? 
uh , poland . 
and that was , you know , prior to world war two . 
but it's interesting that , you know , with the topic i think i agree with you . 
there needs to be more of an open policy . 
and you know we have to remember the chinese came here and were our labor , you know , for the transatlantic railroad 
but what do you think , 
are you from texas 
well , that will be interesting . 
and , uh , 
because we have just ,
what do you think about that ? 
um , i think that's all right . 
i , um , 
at least on the surface it sounds like a good thing . 
do you have an opinion about it ? 
well , i agree with it wholeheartedly . 
the only thing is i've got to share with you , my background is from new jersey . 
because texan philosophy is a little different . 
well , a lot of the experience that i have with this problem has to do with my brotherinlaw who's chinese and immigrated from china . 
and , um , you know he , um , got a green card and is in good standing in america and china , but only because he was always   nice to the chinese government ,
and he was always on pretty good terms with them . 
well we , 
but , um , their , 
my sister just had a baby 
and they're trying to get permission for his mother to come to america to like help care for the kid and that sort of thing . 
and it's turned out to be sort of a horrible problem . 
it's just very difficult to get a woman who doesn't have a lot of assets or whatever out of china even temporarily to visit here . 
oh , well , then you have first in the experience on immigration . 
well , that is interesting . 
well , i wonder , you know , even with those that were involved with tienamen's square . 
you know , did we really protect them ? 
 and i think that's pretty crazy ,
and aside for that , they're the best and brightest of china 
so it's certainly in our best selfish interest to keep them here if we can . 
that is true . 
well , what do you think about , 
we have in texas a large vietnamese population 
what do you think about that ? 
and these are not the brightest . 
we have a lot of boat people in texas . 
well , um , i don't have any problem with that . um , 
you're a true liberal hearttoheart . 
good for you . 
i agree because , 
um , interesting , when my daughter was in high school , one of the custodians was vietnamese 
 and with his limited english they found out , you know , that , she was in student council , 
and they found out that he was a medical doctor , 
uh , i guess , 
i don't know . 
it's the first time i've made a phone call on it . 
so , i guess we're supposed to start talking . 
uh  , what kind of books do you read ? 
i read , uh , a lot of steven king , dean r koontz , uh 
my aunt got me hooked on those .
so i , 
so it's mostly all novels ? 
i'll read some , uh , classic , too . 
oh , like what ? 
uh , like  the graduate  by steinbeck . 
i'll , uh , 
i like that . 
i like steinbeck a lot . 
a rose family by faulkner . that's one of my favorites . 
i have never read a lot of faulkner . 
oh , and that i saw 
and i read the book from that . 
oh , cool .
and , by the way , my name's bill . 
i'm from north carolina .
i'm doug , 
i'm from pennsylvania . 
uh , i , 
let's see . 
what kind of books do you like to read ? 
and , like , i don't really like the , you know , six hundred page long stephen king novels and all that . 
i really have to be in the mood . 
i read one , like maybe once a year . 
i'm not as , 
i like , say , uh , richard broudigan a lot . uh , 
i've never read anything by him . 
uh , he's dead now , 
but he was really a pretty amazing writer . 
he wrote books that were , like , pretty short and pretty easy to read , you know , like written at a third grade level or whatever . 
but they were still very heavy and philosophical , also very funny . 
like , he wrote trout fishing in america . 
so that's , anyway , 
and , uh , i read a lot of non fiction books , too . 
uh , let's see , 
i like to read a lot of non fiction history when 
i found that real interesting . 
i'm reading the lion and the wind right now . 
and that was on t v . 
now what's that ? 
it was , uh , during teddy roosevelt's time .
uh , this is when they were having their revolution 
and teddy roosevelt sent troops over and really portrays him as a , kind of a crazy man , you know . 
surprised me . 
i had no idea that he was like that . 
how crazy ? 
well , just like one quote that he had was that he thought the america's emblem was stupid because it was an eagle , 
and it should be a grizzly bear because 
oh , sh , .
 grizzly and stuff like that . 
so it's , 
i saw the movie 
and that's what made me want to read the book . 
candice bergen was in the movie . 
i'm a real big fan of hers 
see , i also read a lot of books about music because i'm interested in that and fair number of stuff about science and also philosophy things . 
i like to read 
like , let's see , 
and even like reading some new age things , things that i don't quite believe in , 
like here on my shelf i have a book called journeys out of the body . 
i think that , 
it's all about 
i'm fascinated by that . 
and , uh , even stuff about , not like ghost stories , but real encounters with ghosts and 
i like , 
i'm kind of a doubting thomas 
and i like to read stuff like that . 
some of it really 
and i like to read some self help books like , uh , 
i read dianetics once i got past all the gibberish on it . 
uh , did you like it ? 
it was okay . 
it took me a while to really get into it . 
it didn't help me that much .
i see . 
but , uh , i think once you're set in your ways , you're set in your ways . 
uh , then i , 
one real interesting book i read recently was , when i was looking for a job , 
i read , how to get the job that you wanted 
and , it had real good tips 
and it , 
you want to go ahead and tell me your favorite team , or who you think will be doing well this year . 
uh , well , where i'm from the atlantic coast conference is a very big conference 
and , course , we have duke university that was the national champions last year , 
so i'm kind of hoping that they'll repeat again this year . 
they have a lot of the same players back . 
are we talking about , is this the n b a ? 
this is college , 
we have like carolina , and duke , and georgia tech , and n c state , teams that are normally ranked in the top twenty . 
so , hopefully we'll have a good year . 
i don't really follow the n b a very closely . 
and see that's probably all i saw . 
we have moved in the last couple years from utah to texas 
and there's so many colleges and universities in texas , we haven't really followed them too much 
and none of them are our alma mater 
 , so , that seems to help . 
do you like professional basketball ? 
so , course , i was real familiar with the utah jazz , 
and the mailman or karl malone was , you know , pretty big thing 
and , the lakers have always been amazing to watch . 
i did keep track a little bit of the mavericks . 
they've not had any good seasons for a long time ,
and , maybe now that that's over they'll come out of it 
well , that's an up and coming team , though . 
i hope they do something . 
they need to 
or they're not going to have any of the team left at all . 
that's somebody you can get behind and ,
kind of like the cowboys  , i guess . 
they seem to be kind of not having a very good few seasons . 
they , coming out of it this year . 
we'll see if it's held on . 
but , i think chicago will probably with the n b a again . 
the bulls ? 
they'll probably be pretty good . 
course , the celtics are always really good , too , with their players . 
that's true . 
be interesting to see how the olympics does this year with all the n b a players playing on the olympic team . 
that's true , 
it will be interesting . 
it will certainly be different .
i don't know ,
and the season hasn't started yet . 
i'm usually more the end of the season person , 
and we need to talk about baseball 
and so , 
oh , my atlanta braves . 
well , i really do , uh , you know , 
the basketball season's supposed to start in the next couple of weeks . 
it's a long season . 
it is , 
and that's why i've , 
i guess my mind went blank . 
it's like last season was so long ago 
and i haven't really even started thinking about basketball yet 
but , this wasn't a good subject , 
it's a little early . 
we definitely will . 
it's good talking to you . 
all righty , 
uh , i guess my personal opinion , i don't mind paying taxes necessarily . 
i just sometimes wonder if our money is being used in the best way . 
uh , sometimes when i hear even what the politicians are making , you know , when they're getting a hundred and fifty thousand plus benefits and that , uh , i think that's just a bit too much to be paying them , uh , 
and that's all tax money . 
when you figure out how many politicians and each one getting that much , it's just billions of dollars 
that's , i think is just being thrown away . 
and then when you read about that they're spending all the money on , you know , these studies that have no relevance whatsoever , that kind of ticks you off , too . 
but , uh , somebody was telling me the other day that they heard some senator say that what we're paying , it's not that we mind paying taxes , it's that we're paying too much for a lousy government . 
and i tend to agree with that .
i'm not really into what they're doing 
and i think there's just too many levels of bureaucracy . 
i think it uh , less levels . 
well , i know any time there's a big , uh , budget cut , you know , 
i work with the state , 
and any time that gets hurt . 
it's never uh , the person that's making a hundred thousand there . 
it's always the person that's making the least amount , 
i see these , uh , supervisors running around , uh , having meetings . 
i really don't know what they do . 
well , i think we're going to see a streamlining in the government . 
 you know , 
and you're out , you know . 
i think we're starting to see it a little bit now , 
but i think , uh , i don't know what kind of input we're going to get from the public and how they're going to go about doing it . 
because i think we're just getting taxed way too much . 
i mean , right now we're getting taxed probably around thirtyfive percent , or more . 
and that's me not making a whole lot of money . 
well , they got so many hidden taxes , that it's really hard to figure out how much you are paying , because , go to a grocery store , something like that , and you're paying a little tax here 
and you 
gas , i don't know about you guys , 
but there's probably at least about twentyfive on our gas . 
and you don't realize , 
we got a sales tax . 
our sales tax is like eight percent , 
and i don't know what our gas tax is . 
i think it's somewhere around twenty five cents a gallon . 
so . i mean , they're hitting us up , 
and they may not raise it , you know , federally as much one year , 
but then they'll raise it somewhere in the state or the sales tax or property tax or whatever . 
it's just , i mean , you can see that your money is just not going that far . 
well , i know like with reagan , they say no new taxes , 
but they changed the , uh , deductions on you , 
and that just raises your taxes , you know , they just get it a different way 
 so , i mean , to me , it did , uh , raise my taxes . 
well , i mean , you could tell just by how much money you have left over , 
and all of a sudden , i don't know  , it's eating me alive . 
i heard someone say that , uh , if they would just , something about with uh , the defense budget , all that extra money they're throwing back , if they cut back by so much percentage , it could throw back about six hundred dollars , on an average , six hundred dollars , 
i'll let you start this time . 
 well , how much do you like lawn and garden work ? 
oh , for goodness sakes . 
what do you do ? 
well , i work for the state as a grounds keeper . 
well , that's interesting . 
um , so , at this time of the year are you doing much garden work ? .
but , uh , i don't know , 
i've always had a big interest , uh . 
i always had a big garden 
well  , i love to work outside , really , 
and i enjoy flowers and stuff . 
i don't do a whole lot of it , um , at this exact point in my life , um , because i have two teenage boys , 
and so they do all the lawn 
but i still take care of the , you know , flower beds and things like that . 
i was even planning to go out and to , uh , dig up some hibiscus plants that will not make it through the winter here , but , you know , were planted in the ground since last spring 
 and i was going to dig them up for a friend and for some starters for me , 
and lo and behold , about five days ago , we had a freeze down to about , oh , twentythree degrees or something 
 so the 
oh , that's terrible . 
twentythree de , 
and i really feel bad about it , 
it's a plant that we've had for probably twentyfive years that these 
so , they're all gone at this point . 
gardening in texas is really interesting , though . 
i grew up in illinois 
 and , um , texas is just so hot in the summer and so dry , 
why , you know , everyone that lives in town and has yards practically has uh , watering system . 
and so with that , why , our lawns do stay , um , you know , pretty nice all summer , if you water . 
but in the winter , we have bermuda grass 
 and in the winter it turns as brown as a grocery sack 
 and i just think it's ugly .
when i go back home to my parents in illinois in the winter , you know , their grass is fairly green . 
that's one aspect of a lot of those grasses , they go dormant . 
i think the saint augustine and , uh , centipede grass is another one you have quite a bit of down there 
those two . 
some people have , i think it's fescue 
but they really have a heck of a time keeping it going in the middle of the summer . 
they have to water an incredible amount . 
but , um , those lawns look nice during the winter , 
but , you know , they almost stick out like i guess not a sore thumb , a pretty thumb . 
but , you know , when you look at the neighborhoods they're all brown except the one , you know , 
it's sort of like , well , .
well , i know my folks live , uh , in arizona there , 
and , uh , you know , they just grow rocks 
so . i know i was in , uh , houston when i was working for a company once , 
and we were taking care of lawns out there , 
and , uh , that particular year they had just tons of rain , you know , 
it was raining continuously . 
and then , i know with all that moisture , a lot of the lawns get a lot of disease problems . 
that's true . 
houston is dallas area , 
that's where plano is , 
of certain things in your garden ? 
i don't have a vegetable garden , 
i guess i never have here , actually , 
um , but , yes , 
we have neil sperry talks on the radio , 
so what do you guys having up there ? 
i haven't been up there since , oh , lord , fortyeight , i guess .
fortyeight . 
that's a long time . uh . 
well , no , 
it wasn't fortyeight , 
let's see , yeah , it was fortyeight . 
i was in the air force . 
we did an air show no out at , uh 
so what's it been like up there ? 
well , for the past week or two it's been cold and wet 
 but before that , for most of the year , it's been hot and dry . 
uh , like september was hot and dry , 
um , september really was , 
i'm not sure about october . 
i think for about twelve months through september the average temperature has been higher than normal 
it really has been strange here this year , 
i mean , course this whole year has been a different year in more ways than one . 
but , uh , we have all these , uh , 
and we had all this rain , 
and it really is not a bad summer at all , really cool . 
but all of a sudden , october it got real hot and dry and just stayed that way for a long time . 
and , uh , then the end of october it started rain almost a week without stopping , just pouring down , you know . 
there were flash floods everywhere , that kind of deal , 
and then 
and you know , the average , uh , first frost is like the fifteenth of november here 
oh , if you had it early . 
 but usually it's not until later .
it's really strange . 
i think we usually have a frost in october . 
uh , but , you know . we really need the rain that we've been getting , 
and it has not today , 
but the last few days it's been pouring most of the day . 
is it flooding anywhere ? 
flooding anywhere . 
i mean , that's occurred certainly at times in the past , 
but , uh , no , 
it's just kind of , uh , clou , 
we're supposed to have a chance to get some rain the next couple of days here , uh , which will be , you know , a little bit more typical , uh , autumn weather . but really it's strange . 
we haven't really had an autumn . 
it's like we went into winter 
we had   summer lasting long 
then it became winter like , uh 
uh , it's , 
there , you , you know , 
usually there's , uh , 
i have a farm a hundred miles east of here in east texas , 
and you know , all these huge trees just like the eastern hard wood belt all the way up to maine , you know , 
it's that same trees , pines and hard woods , you know 
and , uh , i was up there last weekend , 
and there are trees that still have their leaves on , 
and they're green , 
but they're dead .
you know , the freeze just got them . 
they weren't ready for it at all apparently , 
and we haven't had a typical fall at all . 
not much color , you know , changes have occurred at all . 
really weird this year . 
i'm not sure what that means . 
i don't know . 
our leaves on the ground now . 
i think it was an especially good winter for fall colors . 
oh , yeah , 
it kind of crept in 
that's , you know , 
i think you could drive along in maryland and look at the sweet gum trees on each side and the pines and what not , 
and you know , you could be driving along in east texas and looks just the same . 
it's almost , you know , identical kind of country . 
been that this year 
i was up there cutting some firewood this weekend , 
little oak tree that was dead , and cut it up and split it   .
that's because it can't tolerate a freeze this early . 
is that right ? 
if it would came later it would be all right ? 
uh , there's some trees 
like the white oaks seem to be pretty hardy . 
nothing bothers them . 
their leaves are still green , 
and there are a few oaks that have lost their leaves . 
um , what i notice mostly is the red maples , that the leaves are just dead , the dogwoods still look , you know , they got , uh , bit on the ends of the leaves a little bit , 
but they still look pretty good . 
it just depends uh , on the tree . 
well , it's not often you get , uh , many women interested in football .
oh well .
do you follow football very much ? 
i'm sorry , what ? 
 well we can talk about something else . 
do you have any , uh , 
you married ? 
no , 
well , i guess kids are out . 
what's that ? 
kids are out . 
are you married ? 
got two boys . 
oh , really . 
so do you like football ? 
oh , i follow uh , the cowboys 
but that's about it , uh . 
the same here .
do you live in dallas ? 
 but i haven't been to any games recently . 
but , uh , i try to catch the game every weekend that i can . 
have you ever been to a cowboy's game ? 
um , it's pretty nice . 
we decided just to watch them at home .
that's good . 
at least you , uh , follow the game a little bit . 
um , yeah , 
i'm not a fanatic about it . 
i don't know who played when and who does what like some guys are . 
i just like to watch , 
and hopefully they win .
that's about the extent of it . 
right now i'm in , um , college , 
so i'm more into college football than professional , i think . 
oh , i see . 
what , uh , school are you going to ? 
um , i'm at b y u . 
leslie , what are you studying ? 
nursing . 
my mom's an l v n . 
oh , really . 
so , what are you planning to go into ? 
do you want to be an r n 
um , i haven't really picked a field . 
i don't know , i've thought a lot about labor and delivery 
try that . 
that's what my mom does , labor and delivery . 
oh , really . 
she really , uh , enjoys . 
is she a nurse in dallas ? 
 but , uh , uh , on a late shift . 
she works uh , i guess the graveyard's what you'd call it . 
she works the graveyard shift . 
and she's worked that for , oh , years , when i was small . 
uh , i guess probably going on twenty years now . 
and she really enjoys it . 
she likes the quiet that you have at that time of the night 
uh , she just started a new job at a different hospital , closer to where she lives 
 and she's really enjoying herself . 
she really likes it . 
well , that's great . 
well , good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree . 
oh thanks .
hope you'll like it . 
do you plan on staying in the dallas area ? 
right now i'm in utah , of course . 
oh , uhhuh .
so , um , 
but , my family's there , 
i'd like to go back . 
uh , i think texas , san antonio in particular , has got a large , uh , base of hospitals . 
uh , i don't know about dallas . 
i think dallas is pretty scattered . 
are you in san antonio ? 
oh , okay . 
 but i'm originally from san antonio 
 and they've got large medical , uh , center down there . 
they've got the u t health science center out there also . 
so if ever wanted , you know , pursue anything more than your nursing degree , that'd be the place to do it . 
my brotherinlaw , um , is in the medical profession , i mean , he's at medical school in san antonio right now . 
oh , great . 
well , like i said , good luck to you . 
all right , 
well , um , take care , 
and maybe we'll meet up again some time . 
all right . 
my name is , uh , donna donahue , 
and i live in plano , texas . 
my name is lowell , 
and i live in raleigh , north carolina . 
oh , okay . 
um , do you want to start 
or should i start ? 
go right ahead . 
okay , um , 
i would say that our home is a very typical home for the area that we live in . 
we have , um , three children , 
and , um , they attend the public school here and are very active in a lot of the sports , soccer and baseball 
and , well , my little girl goes to tap dance , 
and my little one goes to preschool 
and , um , i'm home with the children , just do a lot of running around . 
it seems like a lot of my neighbors kind of have a similar type , i don't know , life . 
um , what about you ? .
i'm single , 
and i live in a town home 
we have a lot of town homes here 
and at the time that i bought this one it was just a much better arrangement for me personally . 
i'm not home a lot . 
i travel a great deal with 
 so it was easier to have a home that didn't 
was sort of maintenance free . 
oh yeah , 
well , um , that sounds pretty good for 
i know my husband takes an awful lot of time on the weekends , not so much now , but to , um , maintain the lawn and the edging and the flower beds , 
and it's a lot of work , owning a home with a little bit of property attached to it . 
it certainly is . 
sometimes i think , um , it would be nice to have a town home , with not having all that responsibility . 
well , if you ever get one , be sure the walls are good and thick because if they're not you can hear . 
that's the main thing when i was shopping for one , 
i wanted to make sure i couldn't hear my neighbors 
and that was 
 so i bought one that's more like living in a , 
once you're inside , you don't know you're in a town home . 
oh , that sounds lovely . 
it is . 
they're kind of built on a cattycornered instead of like side by side 
 so you don't actually hear anybody next door to you . 
so in your area then there's probably a lot of , um , career type people that have those type homes 
and , um , the area that we're settled in is , um , definitely with kids . 
they're still doing , um , a lot of building in the neighborhood . 
so the people that move here seem to move from all over the country , which we're from , um , the northeast , 
and , um , seems like a people or also don't have any family around . 
so it , um , also gives you a common bond when you don't have a lot of relatives visiting your neighbors , 
 you know , um . ut , um    , 
well , we also in this area seem to have a lot of retirees 
now um , is it very wooded around where you are , 
there lots of pretty trees and , 
as a matter of fact uh , this particular community that i live in is very wooded . 
oh , how pretty . 
it is nice . 
i do miss that . 
around here in plano there are very few trees 
and it's pretty flat and kind of barren 
and that's the only thing that we don't like about living in texas , is we miss all the beautiful trees and the fall 
 and , um , uh , the landscape is much different here in texas than it is , you know , in the north . um , or even where you are . 
uh , we definitely have a lot of trees here . 
a lot of leaves to rake up too , i bet . 
does that , 
well , see , that's another plus . 
i don't have to worry about that 
and this is the time of year we're starting to lose , 
they're all falling now . 
that's right , 
they are . 
i'm going to get the kids to get outside with the other neighbor kids and do the little bit of raking that needs to be done . 
we just have a few trees in the front and a few in the back but , just a little kind of just in more of a make a little bit of a mess for a few weeks 
and if you didn't do anything about it , then they'd probably the leaves just blow away .
it's not too bad . 
do we have to speak for a certain amount of time ? 
it was really nice speaking to you . 
it was good to speak with you too . 
and have a happy thanksgiving . 
thank you , 
you too . 
the way , 
i'll go ahead and start 
 uh , the way i dress 
or i shouldn't say suit , but coat and tie every day . 
a year ago , i changed jobs from being a researcher 
i guess it's a different set of standards , i guess . 
so , uh , i dress almost the same every day . 
i mean , pretty much it's a white shirt and 
but , it was very different before . 
how do you dress ? 
well , i'm a drafter , 
so i just wear blue jeans and tennis shoes 
and i have sweatshirt on today . 
and that's pretty much the norm for me . 
if i come in a dress , everybody's shocked .
i understand . 
ran out of jeans .
i understand , 
that's funny .
so , does it change ? 
your dress , 
no . 
or , i guess , do you have things like presentations to do or anything like that ? 
so , back in my old job , up until through nineteen eighty 
but , probably once a month or so , there was some reason that i would have to put on a suit .
every now and then i'll get dressed up and come in , 
but that's for my husband's job and not mine .
oh , i see , 
i understand . 
i have to go to a business meeting once a month with him , 
oh . well , that's interesting . 
let's see , uh , what else about this , uh , 
like , two or three levels . 
upper management that always wears gray suits .
if i want to say don't have power or don't have authority or whatever 
 and i guess you are . 
that we dress in the jeans 
and then there's kind of the branch manager level 
but there's not much , 
middle of the road . 
it's nice that there's not a requirement 
sometimes i think there should be . 
some of these women around here look like they came off of harry hines . 
oh , yeah , 
i guess you see those once in a while . 
 and you know they have the no shorts deal , 
and some of these mini skirts , you know , are worse than shorts ever thought about being . 
but , uh , 
that's right , 
i guess isn't there a dress code , something about spaghetti straps , 
i'm not even sure what they are . 
supposedly and backless things 
oh , backless , 
all right . 
 but , i've seen those , too , 
so this wasn't necessarily a big conversation , 
but , i think we , 
uh , yeah . 
 and your name was lisa . 
are you the expressway sites ? 
oh , okay . 
uh , well , thank you . 
all right , 
good day . 
uh , that's advice that i will need in time future 
uh , i suppose i would ask what the child wants to do in life and what the child hopes to get out of college 
uh , let's see , 
when i went away to school , i'm trying to think my criteria . 
i guess when you're eighteen or so , uh , it would be important to know if it was a coed college .
that was a strict requirement for me . 
uh , again uh , i guess they'd have to consider how expensive the college is and how close to home , if they could handle being away for real long periods of time or if they need to be somewhere where they can drive home when they needed to get home . 
uh , let's see , uh , 
what advice . 
oh , okay , uh , 
i guess one clearcut piece of advice is by all means visit the college campus . 
uh , stay in a dormitory if you can . 
go to classes , 
talk to faculty members and students . 
and also , uh , depending on how , uh , uh , adjustable your child would be , or flexible , i guess it would be , uh , 
the way they run things , 
i mean , the northern colleges are very different than the southern colleges , i think . 
the people are different 
and , uh , you have to be more flexible and more willing to , uh , uh , adjust to other people's mannerisms and customs or ways of doing things . 
you know , you have to be a flexible person to be able to go all the way across country to something totally different than what you're used to . uh , 
i'm thinking 
you think so  ? 
but i agree with you . 
uh , let's see , 
what else . 
uh , well , climate would be , 
you know , you'd have to 
 you know , is somewhat , 
uh , if it's something different than the one they're used to , i guess , uh , 
if they're used to the northern weather then the southern weather they might kind of feel like they need to go out and play all the time , not be . f you're in florida or california . uh , 
i'd also advise them that , uh , if mom and dad paid for their college , that , uh , if they decided to drop a course or decided that they need another year , then they'd have to get a loan to continue . 
well , course   or 
that's right . 
the responsibility of that . 
and , uh , uh , uh , they could work and earn money towards college . 
also if they stay within their state , you get a lot more financial aid 
or it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state 
and , like i said , if they was willing to work , uh , in the summers and also maybe then the parents could pay a third 
and then maybe they could take out a loan for a third depending on how expensive it is . 
by the time , i have an eleven year old is my oldest , 
so , it's not too far away , 
but it's , 
mine is twelve . 
oh , okay . 
but it's getting there , 
i mean , we still definitely can put away the money for college now . 
uh , i would advise that they did not have a car at college . 
they would , 
that's my gut feeling , too . 
my son is certainly not persuaded of that .
oh , yeah , uh , 
i didn't have a car in college . 
i think so , too . 
i think because most kids don't have a car at college , the ones that do get taken advantage of 
and , you know , i think it's just trouble waiting to happen . 
so i would advise they didn't take a car 
and , uh 
is it , 
and they didn't take a refrigerator .
maybe that , 
uh , i didn't do any of those , though , 
we didn't have , 
well , let me see , 
what have you seen lately ? 
well , uh , city slickers , and star trek five . 
yeah  , 
only five ? 
i thought i'd better see that one before i go and see six . 
 well , no , 
didn't need to . 
i found that out .
how about yourself ? 
i just saw the latest one . 
how is it ? 
it was fantastic . 
oh , i can't wait . 
the lines in there were just perfect . 
i mean , it was classic trek . 
now , does the old star trek guys meet the new guys ? 
it's just the old guys still . 
however , the rumor happen next time 
you know , that i read in no , it was u s a today 
that they said they weren't going to do anymore . 
that was it . 
uh , except that the rumor is that they still might , 
but it may not include the entire crew 
and it will be a next generation meets this generation .
i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the old guys was . 
i think it's a hundred years . 
somewhere in that range . 
considering that spock was on uh , you know , couple weeks ago 
oh , that's right . 
is that right ? 
he was 
and he just kind of hobbled down the halls real slow . 
vulcans age a lot better .
well , yeah , 
imagine that . 
that's amazing . 
but , did they have some pretty good special effects ? 
but i think the script was , you know , just incredible compared to the last one . 
the script was bad , bad , bad .
well , you know why ? 
uh , william shatner wrote it . 
oh , is that right ? 
and even worse , he directed it . 
nimoy , he does a lot better . 
oh , yeah , 
in fact , uh , he didn't direct this one . 
he produced this one .
but he directed the one before , uh , i think star trek four , something like that . 
 or , no , journey home , i think that was . 
you're a real life trekkie ? 
i really like them . 
i wouldn't go so far as being a trekkie , 
well , i've gone to , you know , one for real live trek convention 
oh , really ? 
huh , did you get to talk to him ? 
it was 
not in a crowd like that . 
it was like , uh , want an autograph , want to stand in line for about four hours . 
it was a pretty crowded place . 
huh . they have some good management principals in this new generation . 
oh , yeah , 
it's kind of funny . 
i , uh , was reading in , uh , a book . uh , trying to think , 
i can't quite remember the name of the book , 
and they were referring to , you know , captain kirk , 
every time he left the enterprise , everything went to hell . 
so he kind of was a cowboy type , too . 
made all the decisions 
but , uh , jean luke does more of a , 
uh , it's definitely a lot better .  lot more realistic really . 
what other movies have you seen ? 
uh , saw the addams family last week . 
oh , how was that ? 
it was pretty good . 
uh , there were a few things different than the old series , 
but on the whole , it was pretty similar . and , a lot of fun . 
oh , yeah , 
did they have thing 
oh , yes , 
i mean , you know , there is lots of areas where thing saves the day . 
and he runs around a lot . 
how did , 
i've always wondered how he gets around . 
uh , you know , just finger hopping . 
he never does come in out of a box , i don't think . 
he was just kind of walking around . 
didn't he used to ? 
he was always 
oh , yeah , that's , okay . 
yeah , 
that's what i was thinking . 
well , do you do any recycling ? 
uh , see , what do we recycle ? 
they recycle , 
they have bins 
 and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and , uh , plastic bottles 
and i think that's all they have . 
what about you guys ? 
well , we , uh , 
there is a lot of things that you can recycle down here , although the only thing i guess i wind up recycling religiously is , uh , aluminum cans . 
but , uh , uh , places , uh , 
they're like unattended aluminum can smashers .
and you can go up there and , uh , redeem , 
we've got one that gives you like a penny a can , 
so if you , 
for smashed cans ? 
and , uh , when you do that it basically crushes them and then drops a penny down a little shoot . 
oh , can you hold on for just a minute ? 
well , anyways , you guys only get a penny a can . 
well , when you buy like , uh , canned drinks and stuff like that , do they charge you for the deposit ? 
uh , no , 
and so it's like they charge you for the deposit , 
so when you turn in the cans unsmashed , you're just , like , reimbursed . 
oh , okay . 
type of thing . 
they don't charge us that extra nickel . 
that's sort of nice , though .
it really is . 
really what happens is we just get a penny a can back off the price , if you want to think of it that way . 
so when we get like , uh , uh , a twelve pack , then that's like twelve cents back . 
so you guys can actually get ahead .
but , uh , they have sort of like , uh , things that you're not like reimbursed for or paid for . 
like we can recycle , uh , clear glass , brown glass , green glass .
everyone does newspapers . 
but , that kind of stuff . 
but they said they can't be smashed or else , uh , 
it doesn't fit in their little containers 
and they're not reimbursed by the people who are over them or something . 
well , shoot , maybe what we ought to do is start sending unsmashed , uh , pepsi cans and whatever 
send it to this address , 
but , uh , let's see , 
even some money basically to take care of the gas to recycle it , you know what i mean , then people tend to do it . uh , 
in other words , taking care of the environment is all well and good 
 but if it's going to cost you to take care of the environment , they're not quite as , uh 
as likely to do it . 
that's true . 
uh , so , you know , if there are some energy savings or if there is some significant savings , anything that they can pass on to the consumer , you know , it kind of reminds me of using an a t m card , you know , to get money 
you know , if it's free , people will use it , 
if it costs them something , then they're not as likely to use it . 
you know . 
but , uh , i know we had a problem down here with , uh , people taking oil out of their cars 
and , uh , all that , because there was , 
apparently a lot of people , you know , every time they change the oil , 
they just dump all their old oil down there . 
now they're starting to recycle that stuff . 
oh , that's good . 
uh , another thing i thought of , i guess , to recycle would be like clothes , because i mean everybody gets rid of their clothes sometime or other . 
and one way that we do it sort of in iowa is that we can take some of our clothes to the consignment shops . 
and that way , you know , you don't get near enough as much as you bought it for , 
but you got the use out of it 
and what you're going to basically donate to a goodwill or whatever , anyways , you can get a little bit of money for . 
and so 
we're new to iowa 
so that's something that i hadn't , you know , looked into before . 
but that's one way to sort of get money and still recycle , i guess . 
i know a lot of places , they , uh , uh , 
okay , 
i guess we're ready to start . 
well , i guess , what part of the country do you live in ? 
i'm in dallas , texas . 
oh , okay . 
what about yourself ? 
well , i'm also in dallas . 
the reason that i ask is the two conversations i've had , have been out of state . 
but , uh , have you always lived here in dallas 
i see . 
and i'm a , uh , 
before that i was at school in rochester , new york 
and i'm originally from boston . 
oh , well , you are seeing quite a different climate and quite a different neighborhood . 
but i like it . 
you probably have enjoyed getting away from the snow . 
but now i go back there 
and i'm a real wimp about the cold .
it's nice . 
well , that's good . 
i have lived in texas essentially all my life . 
around in texas 
and , uh , i have traveled up in the northeast and around and have enjoyed it . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i'm not sure i would want to take on those winters . 
i know . 
i live , uh , over in the lake highlands area if you're familiar with that . 
uh , tell me where that is , uh , 
uh , you , 
but i don't know it by that name . 
this is pretty well where l b j and audelia , skillman 
we're just north of , uh , white rock lake . 
oh , okay , 
i know that area . 
that's a nice area . 
well , we have some very nice homes here in this area . 
uh , my particular , 
so , uh 
uh , the homes that were here earlier were smaller . 
now they've gotten larger and larger as they have developed the land . 
and , of course , it's pretty static right now 
and all the values over here have dropped off because of the economy . 
how about you ? 
well , gosh , i'm barely in dallas . 
i'm just north of addison airport 
and , i guess we have a similar situation . 
i mean , we've got houses two streets away that are probably around seventy , eighty thousand 
 and then we've got bent tree right across the street 
but some of those are pretty big . 
those are over a million . 
so , that's the strange thing about , i guess , dallas because back where i'm from , you wouldn't have that sort of a variation at all . 
they'd all be pretty similar to one another within a couple miles . 
well , we have suffered from real lack of land use planning in dallas . 
not as bad as houston , 
but , exactly what you're describing is what happens all over . 
i've noticed that . 
uh , we've got a house , 
let's see , 
we moved in about four years ago 
and it had previously been unoccupied , 
but it had existed for three years . 
this is a whole block of homes that , uh , a builder built all of them 
and , i guess he did some crazy thing to get some extra money from the bank and then ran away ,
so the whole block was all foreclosed . 
and , so , some were vacant for quite a while before you know , they finally sold them because there were so many . 
well , was your house in good shape , 
was it damaged ? 
oh , it was ? 
so you know , we bargained to get an extra warrantee on that . 
i see . 
and , uh , we haven't had any problems 
and , you know , we had originally thought we'd have to get a fix up special or something because being from the northeast we figured we couldn't afford anything . 
but the prices are much lower here 
and this was definitely not a fix up special , 
but i'll tell you , 
it takes all my time .
between , we put in our own sprinkler system 
and i just finished repainting the exterior and , you know , making drapes and buying furniture , 
it's just a money pit . really is . 
i am 
where i live is a house that's seventeen years old when i bought it . 
and we bought it from someone who was in it , 
but before they had it , i found out after i had been in the house , it had sat empty for the better part of a year . 
and i'm not sure what happened , 
but i do know the folks that we bought it from had done virtually no maintenance for about four years . 
oh , no . 
i found a lot of things , 
i say arlington , texas now because i talked one night to somebody in arlington , virginia . 
oh , my , 
well , and plano , texas rather than plano , illinois . 
oh , do they have one ? 
oh , i didn't know that . 
well , i learned something already .
well , let's see , 
the three questions are what , uh , 
how much time do you spend with your children ? 
very little .
oh , yeah , 
well , mine is , uh , down at u t austin at college 
and the other one is in high school . 
so you do spend less time then ? 
 because they almost don't want to know us . 
they want to be with their friends . 
how old are your kids ? 
are they married or what ? 
uh , yes , 
and the other two , i'm not sure . 
oh , boy , you have a lot of kids . 
between the spouse and myself we have six . 
oh , well , that's kind of nice , though . 
because i came with a split family 
well , no , 
and they're doing their own things 
well , that's true . 
they have to see their other parent , i guess 
 and sometimes they want to do their own thing , 
i know . 
and you know what ? 
sometimes that's okay . 
i know .
that's what my mother said one time . 
you know , right , 
because who says that they just must got to come over to see us all the time 
that's true , 
and if they force them to , you know 
that becomes a drudgery 
well , do they all live in the area ? 
oh , wow . 
uh , you know , well , we're talking like north texas . 
and then , one is in 
and the other one is in everett , washington . 
how did they end up so far away ? 
 well , my little pair .
uh , and , uh , 
those are the youngest ones ? 
well , the s , 
boy , those are a long way . 
j r , my last son 
 and the , third daughter fell in love with , uh , uh , vermont . 
vermont . 
so they wanted to make their homes there . 
that's where they've gone to make their homes . 
my goodness . 
are those two married ? 
well , uh , let's see , 
i wish to god he would go back . 
 oh , they do .
well , i certainly hope so . 
i mean , i've got a daughter that's a sophomore at u t 
and i'm going to u t a right now myself 
well , oh , i agree it's never too late . 
especially in some of these schools around here , i think they have about twenty percent older students . 
and when you're saying older , we're talking fifty up . 
oh , yeah , 
i've seen some people that are really quite up there you know 
oh , my , 
why not because that's a lot of times , well , it's , 
i believe that , uh , we in that category , 
and i'm not in that category quite yet 
 but , we are seasoned minds . 
oh , yeah , 
you're really ready to learn finally . 
i mean , i don't know why i even went to college when i was seventeen . 
it was , 
it was a complete waste of money . 
settle down , 
we know what we're wanting to , uh , study 
and , uh 
and , uh , 
and we don't try to burn the candle at both ends and in 
we don't go out drinking beer till three and try to go to class in the morning .
at seven , 
yeah , we're past that age .
we're smarter now . 
we know what we can do .
uh , so let's see . 
so mine i don't spend a whole lot of time because they're not here . 
what was it , uh , 
what do the trends in families 
and do we approve what other ,
well , uh , the trends in the families were to spread apart , do your own thing . 
that's right . 
but i have seen 
i was going to say the same thing . 
schools are 
 and between a person's religion , uh , their faith in their maker 
and the family 
 those are the two that have the wherewithal 
and , of course , judeochristianity , uh , and of the jewish folks , too , believe that the family unit is the one that was given the , uh , uh , mission by the lord 
so when another group they're tromping on our territory , so to speak , 
i firmly believe that , uh , 
you think you're getting your money's worth ? 
uh , the only thing in texas . 
well , that's probably the next year's agenda . 
boy , i tell you what , 
i sure hope they don't pass something like that . 
oh , yeah . 
they're finding a way to tax you every time you turn around , 
and i think one way or the other , we're going to pay for the bureaucracy , i guess . 
uh , it's one area that is really , i think hurting the economy more than anything . 
i think the taxes they have taking more bite out of the dollars that are available for spending for any kind of products , 
and i think that is probably as big a item fueling the recession as anything right now . 
well , i tell you , um , 
i remember every time , it seems like , we turned around , they're adding another nickel or 
that's right . 
that's right . 
and actually , that one , don't bug me as much as , uh , uh , what are we , eight and a quarter percent sales tax ? 
that's right . 
and every time you go to buy anything now , uh , 
even , you know , they tax food . 
that's the one that really kind of bothers me . 
well , i think allegedly taxes are supposed to be directed towards . 
but , uh , now people with the lowest income pay a hundred percent almost of , you know , taxes on everything they buy , and where people that make , you know , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollars a year , certainly a portion of that , they aren't going to be paying taxes on , you know . 
and , uh , that's the unfair inequities of sales tax as a main source of revenue , 
but i don't think it is anymore , not in texas anyway . 
oh , i got you , because people that , uh , don't make very much money wind up spending it all . 
that's right , 
whatever they spent it on , they have to pay tax on . 
that's right , 
and that's the unfairness of the thing , 
but , uh , i think taxes generally are unfair 
so  , 
or thirty thousand dollars ? 
 i have trouble buying a twenty thousand dollar car still , 
so it doesn't , 
i think , uh , you know , generally the prices of cars have gotten out of line , which is , uh , you know . 
 oh , sure . 
and , uh , i guess if people got thirty , forty thousand bucks to spend on a car , uh , that's their prerogative , you know .
i don't have a whole of sympathy  on that  .
 maybe you buy that , you know , 
and i don't mean to be knocking , uh , 
 uh , no , 
but to me it seems really interesting that they come along and add another ten percent tax , uh , on top of it . 
and there's an awful lot of cars that cost more than thirty thousand . 
there are , 
and the idea of that kind of taxation is to have people think twice on putting their money into that , i guess , you know , unless they really want it , buy something that , you know , 
more , well , it's just like having taxes on , or exemptions for kids , you know . 
it's a way of increasing the population , on federal taxes . 
and where you exempt things , like , uh , uh , one of the best things i heard on taxes to stimulate the economy , someone , brilliant deductor , probably lloyd bentsen , said that all , you know , if they gave back the deductions on credit cards on your federal taxes 
now , i don't know if that's true or not , 
but if you look on all interest things , not just credit cards , but on your cars and , you know , any kind of interest that you're paying , from a personal point of view , that might make certain sense in stimulating consumer purchasers . 
so that's a lot of the games that politicians play on where they want to go , you know , tax things that they don't , you know , to a degree , well , like booze , you know , 
example , they keep raising the taxes on booze , 
it gets to the point , you know , it makes drunks sober , you know .
they quit buying it . 
 well , what about the taxes on cigarettes ? 
well , tell me about your home . 
uh , right now we're living in , 
well it's me , my wife and , uh , two young boys . 
and , uh , right now we're in uh , i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home .
so we don't have a big yard . uh , 
but , uh , when my wife and i first moved in , it was just the two of us . 
so it was enough . 
uh , and it's , uh , i guess what they call a story and a half . 
because it's not a full two story .
so , it's got real high ceilings on half the house 
and the other half is just standard sized ceilings . 
and , uh , it's about a five year old house now . 
it sounds nice . 
it's , uh , pretty nice . 
unfortunately , the builder who built it went out of business already .
oh , yeah ? 
it was a , 
well , you know , these guys that gambled high 
that's true . 
and , uh 
exactly what happened to them . 
i'm building my own house . 
oh , that's nice . 
and as i look out the window of my trailer , i can envision all the insulation that's going up .
oh , really . 
are you doing it yourself ? 
i used to be a builder . 
oh , that's nice . 
and i retired about five years ago and 
 oh , i see . 
and now i'm a college educated builder   .
there's still no work , you know . 
 so , uh , you know , i decided this summer that , uh , you know , we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials 
so i did . 
that's great . 
and , uh , see the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home . 
is that so ? 
i didn't know that . 
you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house 
but you can't borrow the money to build your own . 
well that sounds kind of dumb . 
 well , it's to protect the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home 
 and then it doesn't sell 
and then the bank's 
works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much . right ? 
hence the savings and loan problem we have . 
that's true . 
but , uh , you know , my home is , uh , fairly simple . 
it's designed to be added on to . 
that's good . 
well , i figure it's just me and my wife 
but , you know , i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot , 
so i want 
how big a lot do you got it on ? 
ten acres . 
that's nice . 
well , yeah . 
it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor . 
he's on the other side of a hill . 
and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon . 
that's pretty good . 
well , in the winter time , i can see another guy 
but , you know , 
i can just make out his place , you know . 
and , uh , 
oh , that's pretty good . 
well , i took a lot of time in choosing this site 
oh , any of that in ? 
and uh , we'll use a wood burning stove as well . 
but , in the house itself , i've been working inside , you know , these many months 
 and i have not had to use the heat . 
because it's all geothermal . 
that's pretty good . 
and with all the , 
see i've got , 
on the south side is all glass . 
well , as much as i could get in it , you know . 
i've got one , two , three , four , five , six windows in the east side on fortyeight feet . 
so it's almost all glass . 
and , uh , 
my wife would love that .
oh , yeah . 
i mean , you know . 
she loves lots of windows . 
that's great . 
so , uh , 
is it a single story ? 
uh , it's on the side of a hill . 
oh , i see . 
so the first , you know , 
what i call residential level 
um , i see . 
and the side that's on uh , the other side is about six feet high . 
so i've got a pretty good grade there . 
and then when i put the verandas which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north , south and east sides 
that's kind of like a victorian style ? 
i've always liked that . 
you know , we don't have much yard 
but i built a small deck in the back . 
but , you know , your own deck . 
and , uh , one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck . 
uh , what sort of camping do you like to do the most ? 
uh , well , i do , uh , real rough type camping . 
i have a motor home .
huh , rough type , huh  ? 
oh , yeah , 
motor homes can be a lot of fun . 
they really are . 
i've enjoyed it . 
i've never actually done any , uh , like tent camping , 
uh , that can be a lot of fun , too . 
how about you ? 
well , so far my wife and i have pretty much had to stick with tent camping . 
this summer we went to , uh , the smokey mountain national park .
oh , how great . 
it was wonderful . 
oh , yeah . 
nights were cool enough to where they're comfortable . 
and the days were nice and warm 
and , it was beautiful , beautiful few days . 
that's great . 
it worked out particularly well , especially considering she was , what , six months pregnant . 
so  ,
it worked pretty well . 
it was one of those , dome type pop up tents . 
nice and quick and easy to put up . 
packs away nice and small 
and , about had to be something like that getting around in a pinto . 
well , that's true , 
it was a lot of fun . 
i guess the last real , uh , camping trip i took has been a couple years ago . 
oh , yeah ? 
uh , i went to california up to the sequoias . 
that's got to be beautiful territory . 
i love the big trees . 
uh , up the coast line 
what , like , sequoia national park ? 
i had been there before when i lived in california , 
but that's my first trip back in , oh , goodness , um , um , thirty years maybe .
but , that is god's country , 
it has to be . 
yeah . 
do they still have uh , the scenic , uh , roadways that cut through the center of some of those trees ? 
uh , no , 
the last one , well , 
the first time i was there , the tree was still standing , 
but it has since come down . 
but , they are huge . 
if you've never seen them , it's very awe inspiring . 
well , there is lots of pretty country further west . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah . 
we're hoping one of these days soon after we're out of school to head that way . 
and you just need to take the little one .
oh , yeah . 
yeah . 
they seem to be trailing out quickly . 
yeah  , 
because there is lots to see .
there is , course , the grand canyon 
and , uh , the painted desert is real pretty , in a different sort of way . 
and , course ,  , and you get up into bryce canyon and yellowstone 
and , uh , the grand tetons are gorgeous , too . 
i imagine . 
i would imagine they are . 
course , i guess i'm partial to big tree country . 
i don't know why i got stuck down here in texas now .
i think it's called a job , 
i don't know .
no  , 
place is forested with those concrete trees . 
lot of concrete and glass , you know . 
well , i guess that's god's place , too . 
uh , probably the last one that i went to california 
i took , uh , three weeks . 
three weeks . 
and i was actually on the road a little more than three weeks . 
the whole family , then , was 
that would have to be a blast . 
well , you went out from texas up into that area ? 
and we stopped at , uh , uh , las vegas for a couple of nights , and then , uh , went into malibu in california over on the coast . 
and then we went up the big sur highway all the way up to san francisco .
oh , wow . 
oh , yeah . 
do you have any pets now ? 
we've , uh , 
my folks and i always had a dog and a cat ,
but , uh , right now we don't have anything . 
oh , okay . 
um , that , 
what about you ? 
well , we've just , uh , 
it seems like ,
and , uh , it was , 
  we were thinking about getting a dog if we get into a house . 
uh , someplace where there , you know , 
we can take care of it and everything . 
we've got , 
and campus housing does not even allow thinking about that .
oh , no . 
no , 
we almost got chased out of here for feeding a stray cat . 
is that right ? 
but uh , you like pets and things ? 
  oh , yeah  .
i was raised , 
our house when i was growing up there was almost never , uh , at least one cat in the house . 
it was almost always at least one cat , sometimes , you know , like fifteen or twenty . but , uh , always cats in the house . 
oh , yeah . 
we like pets , 
but , uh , you know , you've got to deal with , uh , taking care of them and feeding them and everything like that . 
and our kids are , 
we've got some children 
and they're not used to it , you know , on a daily basis . 
they , uh , 
how old are your kids ? 
oh , from fourteen down to seven . 
is that right ? 
our first . 
he's about eleven weeks now . 
oh , great . 
where are you from ? 
west virginia . 
um , i don't know how familiar you are with that area of the country 
i've been to charleston . 
charleston , west virginia ? 
that's pretty much the south end of the state , or the southern quarter of the state , anyway ? .
in the north end of the state , you've got that little narrow strip of west virginia going up between ohio and pennsylvania .
right at the base of that northern peninsula 
well , yeah , that's interesting . 
so it's really up north in the country , really ,   .
i guess so . 
well , um , my parents' house is like three miles south of where the masondixon line would have hit the ohio river had it 
i see . 
it's pretty nice country up there ? 
hills , or what ? 
uh , well , from my neck of the woods , it's hilly . 
 um , you know , uh , maybe four hundred feet elevation , uh , 
is it farmland ? 
mostly it's , uh , 
i mean , you know , there's , you know , individuals uh , growing their own food . 
uh , most of the agriculture , it's more in the way of , uh , sheep and cattle . 
oh , yes . 
and even that's , you know , small time mostly . 
uh , the biggest chunk of what's going on there is , uh , industry . 
it's coal mines and chemical plants and power plants . 
uh , aluminum plants . 
there's like two aluminum plants   .
 what are you studying there at  heidelberg   ? 
computer engineering . 
 oh , yeah . 
what year ? 
uh , just finished up my fourth semester . 
well , great . 
yeah . 
i hope that works out well . 
it's a big change . 
i spent , 
oh , did you ? 
well , you've got some experience behind you in the work force . 
yeah . 
i'm working on a bachelor's degree . 
oh , okay , 
it'll be compu , 
hope it's a good program there . 
that's considered a pretty good program . 
it's nice and small , which means , you know , if you don't get the class this semester , then you've got to wait you know , anywhere from two to four semesters to get , 
but , uh , it's worth it once you get it . 
well , yes , 
that's good . 
and probably a good , uh , student teacher ratio and things . 
oh , yeah , 
yeah .
that works out real well . 
well , i was wondering what , if you all were to get a pet , like if you were to move into an apartment 
or a house somewhere , what would you get ? 
uh , well , um , first off we'd probably wind up with a cat or maybe a puppy . 
i'm partial towards the larger dogs . 
um , our last , we've had a couple of cats before we moved on campus . 
uh , had a hamster or two , 
and they got , 
a hamster . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , it's amazing how much character , 
your family have reunions on a regular basis ? 
probably , once every five years . 
uh , you have got a pretty big family . 
and that is the hardest part about getting the stuff together 
and everyone is spread out all over timbuktu . 
oh , yeah . 
and you ? 
but most of us , 
well , uh , uh , i am originally from west virginia . 
most of the family is right in the west virginia , uh , uh , what they call tristate area , uh , northern west virginia , eastern ohio , southwestern pennsylvania . 
most everybody is right in that area . 
that makes it a lot easier . 
a lot more convenient . 
that is why we only do it once every five or ten years . 
 because it is always that hard to get everyone together . 
they put one together for our family about once every june . 
it was on my grandmother's birthday , 
but she is gone now . 
see that is kind of what happened with ours . 
that is why we have not had one in a long time . 
 so , to make one successful , i mean , i mean what do you all do . 
do you all just start planning real far ahead of time ? 
well , no . 
there is , uh , 
so , uh , the day it happens is ninetyeight percent of the planning usually . 
oh , really .
uh , we , uh , get together , at uh , the park , and playground area of the church i was raised in 
 and , uh , everybody brings lots of food 
and some put up the volleyball net and sit around and tell stories and catch up and play volleyball all day and get really fat .
eat a lot . 
oh , gosh . 
it is a lot harder for us because like i said we are spread out 
 and so we have to plan anywhere from six , well really probably a year ahead of time so that everyone , can uh , start their , uh , vacation time . 
schedule vacation time 
and yeah . 
we usu , 
uh , uh , sunday afternoon 
usually , it is like sunday afternoon 
and most people do not have more than you know a couple of hours drive at tops 
is that one of your , uh , 
i mean , uh , 
well , where i am calling from is southern mississippi . 
so , we have got , uh , uh , my wife and i have , uh , a bit longer ways to go than most . 
but , you also manage to make them . 
but we are both in school 
so that makes it kind of tough . 
 uh , they have been happening , uh , just after the summer semester starts . 
you can't really get away . 
we managed to get to one . 
that was before i started school 
and she took that summer off . 
but , uh , 
well , now that we have been talking about it , uh , i am kind of getting home sick now . 
 because it has been over three years since i have been home 
oh goodness . 
well , my grandfather is the only one that is still around . 
and see , my grandmother is the one that use to plan this stuff basically . 
so , unless the aunts and uncles really get on the ball and put stuff together , it is kind of like . 
she was like the glue , 
i understand . 
where is home for you ? 
originally , uh , i , uh , was born in missouri . 
but , uh , you know , we have relatives scattered out all over louisiana , mississippi , uh , here in texas 
 but it is harder for everyone to get home . 
well , maybe this year you can find a more central location . 
so it is easier for us few stragglers to go home . 
oh , okay . 
then the majority of them are still in the missouri area . 
you know our family right now , uh , the most of it , there is only a few stragglers , uh , with any distance . 
there is one cousin out in colorado , uh , uh , some cousins over in phoenix , uh , 
i got a sister over in , uh , washington state .
uh , the rest of them are within , you know , a couple hours drive . 
well , uh , how do you all communicate ? like to plan it and every thing . 
do you all just call each other up on the phone and say this is the weekend we are going to do it , 
or do you all like mail out stuff ? 
it is going to be such and such , uh , weekend 
and , uh , you all come . 
that is about it .
and you know this is the standard pattern . 
it , uh , 
everybody brings their favorite dish 
and , somebody brings the volleyball net , 
somebody brings a whole lot of ice for the watermelon 
well , uh , uh , i guess probably the last one i went to i met so many people that i had not seen in probably over ten years . 
am i related to you ? 
i know . 
i married your cousin's brother's uncle or something like that . 
do you , 
i mean , is that since , 
 i mean do you have them every year ? 
uh , yeah , 
 and , uh , still , you wind up meeting people uh , you never knew you were related to . let alone 
well , i think that is probably why our is probably so interesting is cause we don't have them that often 
oh , yeah . 
 and then when we do , and everyone finally does get together , 
it is like after the , you know , 
so you have eight children . 
um , what type of things do you do as a family to spend time together . 
oh , we spend a lot of time outdoors jogging , bicycling , uh , going to the park , um , some time watching v c r 
we know how that goes . 
uh , with lots of kids you don't have lots of money for recreation . 
that's right . 
well , that's fun . 
so , um , let's see , uh , 
some of the things we do together as a family , we like to play games a lot , 
and you may think this is funny , 
but one of our funnest games we like to play together is hide and seek , 
and we just have a hoot playing hide and seek when it's dark 
and that is so fun . 
the kids just get a crack out of that . 
um , uh , like your family . 
um , we don't do a lot of vacationing . 
have you taken a lot of vacations together 
most of our vacations are to go and see grandma and grandpa . 
and whe , 
we get an occasional one or two day thing 
 but most of them are going and seeing grandma and grandpa . 
oh , now where do they live ? 
in arizona . 
oh , so that's a bit of a drive for you there . 
oh , so you like to go there for the holidays 
oh , uhhuh . 
uh , what are the ages of your kids then ? 
they range from twentyfour to five . 
oh , yeah . 
how old are your children ? 
we have , 
ours start at twelve 
and then they go down to four . 
i think the hardest thing for us you know , leisure time activities that all of our kids can enjoy together 
i bet , 
like the older kids love playing board games and that kind of thing 
 but the young kids don't understand it 
 and so they get real frustrated when we try to do that , 
and then if you want to play something on the little kids' level , then the older kids get real bored , 
and they want to do something else . 
i can relate to that . 
i think it's improving , actually . 
we had an interesting experience the other day . 
a routine that we spend , 
we don't have our kids play with other kids on sunday 
 and we just kind of keep them at home 
 and our next door neighbor , uh , 
we were at a soccer game saturday , 
and our next door neighbor was there , 
and somebody came up and asked if their daughter could spend saturday night at their house 
 and we keep our kids at home so we can spend time with them . 
that's good . 
and i think those kinds of things are happening a lot where we are right now . 
oh , good . 
i think it's gone to one extreme where the families were just running all different direction 
 and i think more people are interested in spending time with their kids now . 
i think so , 
and i feel bush has mentioned quite often , that we are trying to become a kinder and gentler nation , 
and it does begin with the families at home 
 and so i'm a firm believer in that , too . 
i think a lot of people are panicked , how kids are turning out and how things are going for kids and realizing they've got to start doing something . 
that's true . 
well , we see that a lot out here in utah , 
and , um , hopefully it's going to spread , huh .   .
utah's a lot better than texas . 
um , do you have a lot of large families out there in texas , 
very few . 
you feel like you're in the minority ? 
when we tell people how many kids we have they look at us like we didn't have good sense . 
oh , dear .
but , uh . 
well , out here in utah , five is about 
my wife and i were in utah until 
never been back , since then , 
so we get up occasionally . 
oh , i have some relatives out there in texas , 
in fact my mom's out there in texas right now , in dallas , spending a month with her cousins , on their ranch , 
where in dallas ? 
well , uh , no , 
i'm trying , aberdeen ? 
is that close to dallas ? 
i don't have any idea . 
i've never 
must be a 
don't you . 
i guess it's out there , clear out . 
they have a ranch that has like five hundred acres , 
martin , do you do any exercise ? 
uh , i like to , uh , play basketball and weight lifting . 
those are probably the two main things i like to do . 
um , so those are more or less indoor sports . 
how's the 
um , it's probably too cold to go out and do things like tennis . 
um , i like to play tennis in the 
but in the winter it gets pretty cold . 
um , yeah , 
so it's mostly indoor sports , i think , in the winter . 
um , how about yourself ? 
well , yeah , 
i'm on a exercise program . 
i'm riding my aerodyne bike , um 
and i'm just about ready to up it to up to fortyfive minutes a morning , 
and i feel like that's been a real nice exercise in the winter time . 
do you do , uh , any anaerobic type , weight lifting or weight training type exercise ? 
i'm about fifty pounds overweight , 
and so i'd like to get the weight off , 
and then i'd really like to get into that . 
and , uh , a , aerobic video that's called the firm . 
i don't know if you've heard of it , 
but it's an aerobic video with , not necessarily bouncing around and jumping up and down , 
but you're using weights , 
and that is the most incredible aerobic workout i have ever done . 
it's similar to aerobics with weights 
 but it's like low impact aerobics , just 
are you familiar with , um , step or bench aerobics ? 
um , no , 
i mean , yes , 
but i have never done it myself . 
have you done that ? 
uh , yes , 
in atlanta that's , um , 
most of the health clubs 
that's the in thing . 
that's the big thing , huh ? 
at first it was just regular aerobics , 
but now bench or step aerobics have 
so how is that ? 
um , they call it a low impact aerobics , 
and it's supposed to burn off more calories 
and from when i've done it , it does give you a real good workout . 
but only thing i'm concerned about is potential for injury to your knees 
it won't , 
but you never know . 
now , if , um , playing basketball , are you knees , 
do you have healthy knees ? 
oh , dear .
but , i've kind of taken care of that . 
i wear high tops and then also a support ankle brace which is very stiff 
 and , um , wearing that i haven't had any problems in the past year or so . 
oh , that's good . 
well you sound just like my husband . 
and , oh , he's just had a heck of a time getting that ankle healthy . 
so that's what he does , 
he wears his brace and his high tops 
i injured mine so many times that 
oh ,   .
i mean , it would only take three or four days 
and i could play again on it 
 oh , dear . 
how successful is your exercise video ? 
it is amazing how fast you take off the inches 
 and once i start my forty , i'd like to do the fortyfive minutes a day on the bike for a week , 
and then , every other day i'd like to incorporate the video , and then the bike on the other day . 
but , it is really amazing how fast the inches come off , 
and the muscle builds 
um , you can start , 
they recommend doing the video without weights for the first month 
and then after that you can just start with your five pound dumbbells , and then build up to your , uh , twentyfive pound dumbbells 
 and then you're just doing repetitious exercises throughout the whole video 
and it's a hour long video , 
so it's a good workout . 
it is , 
i really enjoy that , 
so i'm looking forward to losing this weight and 
so , in the winter , i guess , there's a lot of , 
it's quite cold and 
um , we could have been out walking throughout the whole winter , because really we only had about three weeks of snow on the ground . 
it was quite chilly 
but not , 
i'm sorry .
that's okay . 
i'm bill from raleigh . 
and i'm melanie from harrisville , utah . 
oh , another one from a different state besides texas . 
 um , okay , 
have you ever had to plan a family reunion ? 
uh , yes 
and no , 
but uh , it was a birthday 
 and i brought a lot of family together then . 
and how did you feel it went ? 
it went pretty good . 
i've worked in hotels , 
so i kind of know how to do these things . 
i used to , you know . 
all this planning and getting together and such . 
um , oh , let's see what else . 
usually when we have kind of our family reunion it's my grandmother's birthday , 
she has like seven sisters i think . 
oh , boy .
they show up and all their kids . 
and then all , she has , uh , 
i have like , uh , 
let's see , 
she has four sons and two daughters , 
so it's a pretty big reunion , 
it's about two hundred people , maybe . 
oh , my word . 
 well , what did you find was most helpful in planning the birthday get together ? 
um , and everything , uh . 
i guess probably the most helpful thing was that , um , for the rent , we rented like a rescue squad building or something 
and , uh , for like soft drinks 
oh , that's good . 
and each person in the family , you know , brought a dish , or something . 
and then did you have a main meal , 
or did everyone just bring , 
it was just pot luck . 
you know , everybody brought their specialties , i guess you would say . 
show off a little bit .
now how old is she ? 
uh , she's eightysix . 
oh , goodness . 
is she , you know , pretty . 
now she does , 
oh , wow . 
 and if she didn't have arthritis , she'd get around better 
 oh , that's neat , that she's in good health , and at that age . 
oh , yeah . 
my nickname for her is honey woman . 
that's what i call her . 
 well that sounds fun . 
well , i had a real challenge of planning a family reunion a few years ago , 
and there were , 
we sent out five hundred , uh , announcements , because our family is quite large , like your family there . 
and so that was a real challenge , 
and i was president of our family reunion for two years , 
and i wasn't very   at that duty , for two years in a row , 
but i found that advance planning was the key to success . 
uh , also one thing that's helpful , 
and i don't know if your family's spread out or whatever 
 but all my family lives like in the same county 
so  , 
oh , that's wonderful , though .
but it's just kind of like get on the telephone 
 and everybody just shows up . 
oh , well , that is helpful . 
our family ranges from , oh , goodness , well , australia , 
i have a brother lives in australia , to , uh , boise , idaho , and , uh , all kinds of places . 
i would say you're spread out , then . 
we are .
uh , my immediate family , you know , my parents and my brothers and sisters , i guess we're the ones that have the gypsy blood or whatever , 
because my dad was in the army 
and we're 
but since they've moved back to carolinas , we still are the only ones do not live 
i live in raleigh , 
and then my parents live in greenville , 
and i have one brother and his wife 
so i mean , we're spread out , 
oh , my gosh . 
nobody moves away except us .
they must really like it there . 
oh , you're ready to move on to bi , 
how do you feel about gun control ? 
well , uh , i mean i don't think that guns should be outlawed 
 but it's going to , 
a lot of the stuff that , 
i mean all you do is to get guns 
well , don't you think that you know , just having , you know , some , you know almost like a driver's license be required you know with stiff penalties if you are found with you know a gun that is not registered or you know that you are not licensed to carry . 
well do you even know what the procedures are now ? 
there is no national , 
but , it's kind of like if you want a gun you can get a gun , especially if you have the money to pay for it . 
uh , in most states as long as you aren't a convicted felon .
uh , and be obviously insane , 
you know but have your legal right to get a gun . 
huh . i didn't know that . 
well , that's pretty scary . 
uh , yeah , 
seems like it's a good safe number to pick , you know . 
well , i mean , i mean i don't really know how they can really enforce the laws any better 
 because i mean i do think that some people need them like , for protection and stuff 
 and i can understand them wanting to have them , 
but then again it's just like all those nuts out there . 
 well , you know , uh , uh , no , 
if you are looking at like you know country uh , where they do have a lot more gun control , like england and places like that , you know 
the amount of violent crime has decreased by so much . 
it has ? 
 because then , 
 well i mean yeah . 
uh , the 
uh , you know , i mean , the problem though , you know , since the united states had this , you know , pretty much unrestricted flow of guns going for so long that i think , you know , if you were introduced , you know , any controls , it would probably take a long while for them to take effect just because there is a glut of guns out there already . 
you know , so it's really kind of a complex problem . 
well , is the crime that bad there in atlanta ? 
 uh , i'm not really sure how bad it is . 
i've not really had that many problems with it , 
but i mean apparently we were ranked pretty high up . 
i know dallas is . 
 uh . i mean , i think , you know , in the te , 
i mean i think we have been like ranked in one of the top three for murders in the last few years . 
i don't know if dallas is in the top three 
 but . do you own a gun ? 
if i get one , i think i will probably , you know , get something . 
i probably wouldn't get a hand gun . 
i would probably get like a shotgun . 
just for protecting myself . you know , from 
i do kind of live in the downtown area . 
you know and shotguns are really good because they're , 
i mean somebody is not going to break in , steal it , and you know , use it to mug someone , you know . 
that's true . 
uh , and you know , you , 
i just don't understand these people , you know , like when they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves . 
they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know , 
they are probably going to miss the person 
and they're going to shoot through five wall ,
i mean a shotgun just really struck me as being you know a real good defensive weapon . 
you can sort of point it somewhere in the direction of 
you pretty much stop them . 
and , you don't , 
then the actual shot doesn't go that far , you know , a wall will stop it pretty much . 
and , uh , my dad gave me a gun 
 but i never did go out and practice with it enough to feel comfortable with it 
 so i finally ended up giving it back to him . 
i don't want to be responsible for it because 
that really does scare me . people , you know , that have guns 
because you know , if you ever get in the situation where you know you are not prepared to shoot , 
but you pick up the gun and point it at the person 
and they get it from you . 
and you know , you're pretty much dead you know . 
set them off . 
unless , you know that you are a real danger to them 
and then you know you know , stop you . 
well that's why i ended up giving it back to him . 
 and i just didn't want the responsibility . 
so . well , uh , did you hear about that killeen massacre or whatever ? 
did it happen at a cafeteria or something ? 
i would be scared selling guns to people . 
so , julie , how do you feel about aids research ? 
i think we definitely need more of it , definitely . 
i'd agree , too , 
but , i mean , it seems like it just makes economic sense in that , you know , uh , you know , 
it would have made even better economic sense longer ago . 
oh , yeah , 
for certain . 
you know , you know , because , uh , the country's going to wind up paying for the treatment of patients . 
do health insurance policies , like , for companies and things , do they cover diseases like that ? 
but what they do is , uh , if , you know , you apply a insurance policy 
and if you are , not only will they not give you , uh , a policy , 
but uh , they have like , 
there's like , you know , a database of people that have tested positive , 
so you'll never be able to get insurance ever again . 
um , well , started doing stuff before . 
i mean , still , you know , since it's dormant for such a long time , there's still probably a lot of people , you know , before the tests ever really came out 
i think a lot of it because the majority of the high risk groups were people 
and all these godfearing people were like , well , you know 
but , uh , 
that's a good one . 
so , uh , 
uh , do you actually think we're doing enough right now to , 
i did like a research kind of thing on aids research and stuff , 
and , uh , really we're not doing much at all , 
i mean , gets raised by , uh , uh , you know , 
private organizations . 
like , uh , san francisco has a real , uh , strong aids support group and all that kind of stuff 
and , uh , i think there needs to be more of that sort of on a federal level , you know , rather than just in the places you know it's 
i don't know , 
i don't know what the likelihood of that is , 
but , i mean , you know , people really waking up . 
especially with the ultra conservatives 
i would probably agree with that . 
that's a good question , fish . 
i don't know , 
uh , but education because a lot of people sort of get drummed out of the work place and out of society , you know , kind of like lepers would 
 and until the , disease reaches its final stage , you know , becomes really infectious 
 and , uh , i think that would be the most effective support they could get is for other people you know , try to understand what they're going through and everything and try to understand that 
 and , uh , i don't know , 
i guess i think it really needs to come to an end .
i don't know . 
i don't know , fish . 
what do you think about that subject ? 
i think  it stands  a really interesting question of , uh , 
well what do you feel about the , um , present situation in the mideast ? 
well , it looks like it's just about as volatile as it usually is . 
what do you think , mark ? 
i agree . 
i think there's definitely been some changes , um , 
and i think you know , on the situation . 
oh , yeah . 
um , you know , in that you know , 
basically since the end of world war two there was always , you know , that little proxy war going on .
and then we'll see what happens when , uh , they're not funded quite as much .
but on the same token , you know , israel has lost a lot of their , you know , value to the u s in being , you know , the foothold of capitalism .
well , we tend to be pretty strong supporters of israel ourselves , 
 you know , we kind of cringe when they make mistakes but yet 
but , i think one of the most interesting things to me recently was , you know , during the war ,
that just seemed to me to be uh , a phenomenal , uh , demonstration of restraint , 
and it must have reflected , uh , uh , some awful good , uh , diplomacy on the part of the u s . 
but on the other hand , you know , if they would have had a hard time retaliating because they wouldn't have been given access to the friend or foe codes . 
i see . 
 through , you know , two enemies . 
oh , you don't think they got the codes from the u s already ? 
the u s would claim that they would have not given them to them . 
i see . 
i mean , of course , you know , public statements can be taken for , 
that's true . 
 yet they , 
 well what do y , 
what about this situation with you know , the , uh , continual , uh , harassment by iraq right now and , uh , apparently failing to let the , uh , arms inspectors have free access . 
 well , to begin with , you know , 
i pretty much question in actually the original involvement . 
uh , i , 
the cynical side of me says that , you know , it was more for , uh , the domestic political situation than for anything else .
huh , yeah , 
uh , i mean uh , with , um , hussein . 
 i mean i'm enter that fight . 
but , you know , that , um , we chose to have our official feelings hurt . 
where a lot w , 
 well , do you think that , uh , we should ignore it and just allowed him to go ahead and , uh , 
 i think that , um , in the past we've allowed lots of things like that to happen . 
and i really don't think that , 
there were a lot more demographic related interests involved than true foreign policy interests . 
well may have been . 
you know , i'm not saying that that's not the case . uh , 
and i mean getting , uh , the iraqis out of kuwait . 
in fighting a second battle . 
um , you know , accomplish much for him politically . 
it doesn't look like we're getting ready to do much more in there . 
even at this point . 
well what about , uh , 
do you have any views on , uh , israel's relation to the u s ? 
do you ,
or what do yo , 
um , i think we've had almost a , you know , ha , t , 
so , uh , i don't know . 
oh , they did ? 
uh , they had been doing it , 
they started first in sarasota city .
and , uh , they've got these , i don't know what , if you're familiar with sarasota county at all . 
they've got these , 
it's county wide program now . 
and what they've done is they've broken everything down into garbage . uh , yard trash .
which , in the paper , it's just , uh , newspaper and corrugated cardboard .
no slicks . uh , 
oh , that's good . 
let me ask you this . 
do they require you to presort it ? 
see that's something in minneapolis they're really strict on . 
in terms of you got to put everything in its own little bag and really presort it really , you know , tightly . 
but when i lived in orlando , it's like you could put almost anything in there 
 and they'd just sort it out for you .
it was really pretty good if you're lazy like i am , 
well , you know , uh , i talked to this girl 
an acquaintance of mine 
 and she's involved with , uh , oh , 
what is the name of that company . 
it's not amway 
but it's the other big vitamin company ? shaklee . 
oh , okay , 
 and she's just shaklee crazy , you know , because it's her business and everything . 
you know , and she asked , 
we were talking one day 
and she asked me a couple of questions , you know . 
that generally , the problems that people have with being environmentally conscious is number one , they don't want it to change their lifestyle 
that's what recycling at home sorting does , you know . 
i mean it's a little extra work . 
and , uh , it can actually turn out to be a lot of extra work because what 
it can , 
you put your garbage in a garbage bag 
and you set it out by the curb . 
if you have yard trash , you put your yard trash in some kind of container . 
uh , or you can have bundles up to a certain weight , and certain dimensions , tie them up and 
you got to tie them up and everything . 
well , the plastic , cans and glass , they give you this little tub 
and it's about a foot and a half deep 
and it's about one by one and a half foot wide and long . 
this is a little container . 
and then they have another one the same size . 
that one's red . 
then they have a blue one the same size for the paper goods . 
and , so , like , you know , you would have to rinse out your pop cans . 
otherwise you got bees and ants 
it is , you know , a big 
 so not only do you 
that's true . 
i mean , up here , they give you one of those containers 
and you put everything in it . 
so it's like , if you use a lot of stuff , you , 
it's like well you know , if you're a partying kind of guy and you drink , you know , like a couple of twelve packs , maybe , over the weekend 
this is true . 
so it's 
this is true . 
but , uh , i don't know . 
that's definitely one thing they could do to make it easier is to just , you know . 
you twenty , thirty bucks an hour , 
have them do a little bit of the sorting .
make it a little more convenient . 
they've got these large garbage cans that you can rent from the waste management company here .
and it's on wheels 
and it's big . 
 oh , you can actually rent those ? 
that's interesting . 
yeah .
up here the city provides them . 
kind of like , 
 i think in the city they do 
but out here in the county you have to rent them . 
oh , okay   .
and they just add it on to your water bill or something . 
so where exactly are you in terms of , like , sarasota ? 
east of sarasota . 
and sarasota is on the west coast ? 
about an hour . 
uh , yeah , 
well . i listen to this talk radio station down here 
and it's really , 
i don't if you ever listen to talk radio 
but they get into some really good conversations sometimes , you know . 
and some of it , sometimes it's serious 
and they have some good feedback and all that stuff 
and this kind of fits into uh , the aid program , 
the welfare program that's going on right now . 
and it's like , uh , 
so , uh , what things do you consider an invasion of privacy ? 
ooh , well i don't know . 
what do you think ? 
oh , i don't know . 
i had a little bit more time to think about it . 
i was thinking of , like , uh , 
 i don't know , 
i started to think about all the big , you know , data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports 
and i don't know , 
i don't know what they actually have in there 
 well what about , uh , required drug testing , uh , as a , uh , condition of employment ? 
that was the other one i was thinking of .
i think that's , uh , 
i mean i know drugs are illegal . 
it   thing actually . 
uh , i , uh , have worked at texas instruments . 
 huh . uhhuh . 
and , uh , they instituted a drug testing policy where they randomly would test , uh , employees 
 and actually , to tell you the truth , i really did not think much about it . 
i hadn't , you know , 
it really didn't relate to me . 
but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they get a false positive , you know , what recourse do you have . 
and , also , uh , uh , this is against the law for the government to do this kind of big brother activity 
and yet , uh , a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments , although they don't admit to it , actually , oh , a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure . 
so what that means is , to me , that really it's the government that's requiring this , 
although they don't actually execute it themselves , it's really the government that   .
so , in that sense , at least , philosophically , it's really borderline legal . 
well i think that , you know , a person's competence should be more determined by , you know , their actions and their behavior 
and controlled substance then , you know , it kinds of takes away from the job of , you know , the supervisor or manager type person , you know , who is able to evaluate them . 
i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with you know , a chemical , you know , 
 well , what about this , uh , aids epidemic now ? 
where you find that , uh , uh , you know , certain people 
these people that are carriers and 
uh , it destroys their libido . 
  yeah ,  that would be kind of an extreme . 
now , uh , you know if they ever , 
 i mean i've heard of things like , you know , you know , or something like that or , you know , putting them all someplace like in a kind of , 
 so what about that as an invasion of privacy ? 
wel , i guess it kind of borders on i mean what do you value more . the invasion of , uh , the person's privacy or the possible danger to , you know , other people . 
so really , 
it gets to balancing , uh , personal freedom against , uh , the general welfare 
i guess that's been the big role of government , i guess .  mean generally . 
 well , it's supposed to have been . 
well , that's kind of a difficult one to go into . 
i mean that particular case . 
it   , 
because i mean , there's a lot of people that , uh , i mean they could require , you know , you know , there's a huge part of the population , 
not a huge part but a , you know 
a growing part . 
the aids population i guess that have it , that don't know they do 
but , again , to require , you know , such a test discriminatory practices and other things . 
i don't know , 
uh , i don't know how exactly i feel about that . 
 maybe  chop their weenies off . 
i guess , uh , uh , it's an easy one for me . 
i think uh , there's something seriously wrong , 
what is it that you are , you know , particularly upset about ? 
 uh , uh , i think they've lost their compass 
and , uh , i'm not sure they know exactly what , uh , uh , public education supposed to be for anymore . 
but , uh , i voted with my feet 
and , uh , my kids go to parochial school . 
so , uh , 
what do you feel that your kids are getting in the parochial schools that they wouldn't get in the public school system ? 
well , one hundred percent of the , uh , customers care . 
that's one thing . 
everybody cares about the education the kids are getting . 
and , uh , they , uh , take an relatively active part . 
 uh , i mean if you're , uh , sending two thousand dollars that way every year , you , uh , watch what goes on and you , uh , uh , pay attention and participate 
and you can influence the way things are . 
so you're saying that the taxpayer who also is really paying through the pocketbook for the education of the child may not be quite so conscious of the fact that they are paying the tuition for that child in the form of , uh , real estate or other taxes 
and , consequently , they're not so motivated to get involved and make sure things happen the way they'd like to see them happen ? 
the immediacy just isn't there . 
and , uh , uh , i also think that one of the problems 
and , actually , i think this is a cultural problem . 
the , uh , problem with public education is uh , really a problem with the culture . 
and , i guess my evidence for that is the school districts in places like california , for example , where only a minority of the taxpayers have children in school 
and you can't get a tax levy passed . 
uh , people are , uh , reluctant to pass , uh , school tax levies even , uh , when the money is needed or would be well spent because uh , they don't have kids in the schools . 
i think that's a loss of civic virtue and a loss of , uh , uh , the cultural attitude that we used to have that education was first even if it wasn't our kids . 
i think uh , as their problem 
and there's an immediate problem . 
it troubles me too that the priority seems to be with my particular purse strings rather than the public good 
and by definition , for some of us , at least , the public good includes having an educated populace and  then  
uh , it means that you've got to be informed 
and you've got to have a certain level of education to do the reading 
you know , i believe that the original idea of public education in the united states , which i guess was controversial at the time of the constitution . 
uh , you know , it barely made it . 
i think it was added afterwards .
i think the principal was , uh , education for civic participation . 
the idea was that everybody should have an education so that they would be a better voter 
and you couldn't pull the wool over their eyes . 
it has taken on a more profound , 
and you'd think we'd notice it , economic uh , thrust . 
 well , that's exactly what i was going to say . 
now there seem to be really three reasons for education . 
one is education for civic duty . 
one is education for economic reasons . 
and one is education for civilization . 
 i mean and i think that one , 
 well i'm glad that you added that one . 
i think that one's significant . 
that's what i used to think education was all about when i was a college professor 
and then i quit and got disabused of that notion .
but , uh , uh , uh , now the only thing people seem to agree on is that education is , uh , an economic enterprise to train people for jobs . 
and , uh , i'm not sure that people in the education establishment really know what their purpose is . 
and i'm really sad to say this , 
i never thought i would have 
but i really think that , uh , the educational establishment has become part of the problem . 
and , uh , that's why i guess i'm sort of , reluctantly , uh , in favor of these , uh , choice programs . 
well agree with everything that you've said so far 
and the only that i'd want to add is that i'm a little more in contact , i think , with public school teachers than perhaps you are , uh , except as a parent of your child 
and the sense that i get from public school teachers that i know is that they are very conscious of what they feel they should be doing 
and they are the three things that you mentioned . 
but they find that they are also being asked to do a bunch of other stuff which they think is only tangentially related 
that's what , 
 like consumer , 
kids too ? 
yeah  .   .
 oh , you laugh . 
 how many , 
what ages ? .
well , twentyseven up . 
and we had five . 
you've been through the fun part .
oh , yeah . 
and how about yourself ? 
i have a four and a half and a three . 
 so . it's , 
in the way it's done now and then . 
well , when mine were growing up , i did some traveling but not that extensively 
but i always   just made it a point , you know , to spend about ten minutes with each one of them . 
so it was an hour , you know . 
but whether it was going back and laying in bed with them and just shooting the breeze or whatever , telling them stories or reading to them . 
what was the age difference between the youngest and the oldest ? 
six years . 
so they were all real close ? 
that's tough . 
that's a lot of time . 
 oh , yeah . 
we look back and wonder how we did it . 
did you both work ? your wife too ? 
uh , well , qualify that . 
she worked at home , i'm sure .
 well , yeah , 
but that's , uh , 
well both my husband and i work 
and sometimes i feel like , you know , by the time i pick them up and get them home and get them fed , i have very little time each evening . 
maybe thirty minutes max . 
well that's plenty though . 
 and well he spends a lot of time with them while i'm cooking 
and then i spend time with them while , you know , he's doing other stuff . 
and , of course , we try to spend a lot of time on the weekend . 
you know , there's a lot of times my house may not be as clean as i particularly like it 
but it's neat , 
it's straight 
and i can live with it because 
well , you know , with kids you're not going to have a neat house . 
well , i've accepted that too .
 and , you know 
that's true . 
it is . 
that's true . 
well , that's true 
and we do a lot of that on the weekends , you know . 
we try to spend saturdays together . 
if my husband golfs , you know , he'll do it during nap time , things like that where they're not really missing the presence , you know . 
and we do a lot of family things together . 
we're kind of going the other direction this weekend . 
we're planning a trip , just he and i . 
this is the first time we've gone anywhere without the kids 
 well that's good too . 
that's good that way too .
well , i decided that , you know , you need that once in awhile . that you , you need to plan the quality time 
and i do think that if you plan it and spend that and make it quality time you don't have to be there twentyfour hours a day . 
well , all it takes is about five , ten minutes a day . 
you know , and as the kids got older i made them , you know , help me cut the grass and 
and they think that's a family activity , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah . 
that's great fun .
and , uh , well , yeah , 
of course , you can .
just keep them talking that way . 
but , uh , another thing we used to do is have family councils .
and what would you do , 
discuss everything that didn't agree with them . 
and we'd take turns being president . 
and everyone would get one vote . 
and i always thought we'd get outvoted five to two 
 but it never worked that way . 
so they would just pick whatever issue kind of was at a 
well and we could bring up 
and then , 
and that was always good time . 
boy , we really got to know the kids well . 
i imagine . 
and i imagine you still have a very close relationship with them . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , that's wonderful . 
but if you have a problem with what we did or how we did it , you can always come back and talk to me about it . 
well , we did too . 
and i remember the one daughter saying , we had a friend of hers that used to drive us up a tree 
so why make fun of mine ? 
uh well . 
 kind of hit us between the eyes . 
now that's good . 
i like 
 and then 
but if they missed it , they had to abide by the rules . 
well i think that's great . 
and we'd usually take notes 
 and , you know , the younger kids , uh , or maybe all of them needed help at one time or another . 
 uh , but they were usually tougher on themselves than they were on us . 
and they loved it . 
i think that's true . 
and we would always come up with something that was harder than what they would have done 
so i do think it's right that they're harder on themselves , you know . 
but , uh , boy , i feel for you and your husband . 
 oh , why is that ? 
well , uh , two of my , uh , 
 so how do you feel about it ? 
uh , with testing for random drugs . 
i , myself , almost , uh , am in favor of it . 
uh , i work at honeywell 
and i was brought on . 
i think that's pretty standard . 
at least at honeywell it is . 
uh , i think it's important to insure the quality and , uh , i don't know , almost the goodness of character . you know 
where do you work ? 
 oh , okay . 
 and i just came from saint paul .
oh , great . 
and , uh , they have a policy for , uh , testing . 
if they make you an offer , then they'll test you right before you start . 
and i guess the only drawback i can see in case you are on some sort of medication that might give some , uh , sort of false positive result 
but i , 
and that definitely happens , you know . 
i mean the drug tests , sure they're accurate 
but there's always that margin of error . 
and that's something to be aware of . 
another thing is , a lot of times , you know , they aren't that accurate . 
they aren't that sensitive . 
like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind , you know , what are they going to do about that .
you know , i was on a couple of different prescription drugs when i was tested for honeywell 
and , uh , uh , you know , i know they didn't catch that or else they would have said something . 
uh , i'm sure they screen for just a particular few types . 
and then they list about five thousand drugs they try to test for . 
uh , i don't know . 
what program are you in over at carnegie mellon ? 
uh , electrical engineering . 
oh , okay . 
uh , yeah , 
i'm a graduate student at u c f in florida . university of central florida . 
oh ,  wow  .
 and this is actually a an internship up here . 
but , uh , they do the whole random drug or the whole drug testing thing , 
they test you , uh , before you start or before you even 
uh , they essentially , 
i sure don't uh , 
so , uh , it was one of those things where you go through the general battery of all their tests 
and then , they essentially give you the offer 
 and then at that point they'll ask you to go to a drug testing and things like that . 
i'm actually in a mall calling 
what happens if you were to fail ? 
that's a good question . 
they probably give you a chance to explain yourself 
but , uh , you know , once again , those things are not that accurate 
so there's undoubtedly a proportion of people who do fail , you know . 
but , uh ,  wha ,  
are you working right now anywhere 
uh , no . 
 oh , okay . 
that was the first time i'd ever gotten any kind of drug screening , you know . was going to honeywell . 
a friend of mine is also a doctoral student down there . 
and he's doing an internship with i b m . 
and , uh , they , basically , uh , did the same exact thing . 
uh , we both got our internships at the same time 
and we both had to go through drug testing at the same time . 
so , one of those things where we went through a kind of an identical process . 
 but , uh , 
 right now , at work too ? 
uh , i think the unwritten rule is , yeah , expect it 
but they don't do it . 
you know , so . that's good i guess . 
i don't know . 
i mean , since that time 
and while i don't do any drugs myself , i've seen some people who work there , uh , you know , smoking a joint or whatever . 
and , uh , you know , that's the kind of thing that would definitely come up , you know . 
but no , 
is it formal policy that they said they might test ? 
uh , first , um , i need to know , uh , how do you feel uh , about sending , uh , an elderly , uh , family member to a nursing home ? 
well , of course , uh , you know , for their own good . 
i'd be very very careful uh , you know , checking them out . 
uh , our , 
had t , place my mother in a nursing home . 
she had a rather massive stroke uh , about 
and , uh , i was fortunate in that 
i was personally acquainted with the , uh , people who , uh , ran the nursing home in our little hometown . 
so , i was very comfortable , you know , in doing it when it got to the point that we had to do it . 
but there's , 
well , i had an occasion for my motherinlaw who had fell and you know , could not take care of herself anymore , was confined to a nursing home for a while 
that was really not a very good experience . 
uh , it had to be done in a hurry . 
i mean , we didn't have , you know , like six months to check all of these places out . 
and it was really not very good , uh , deal . 
we were not really happy with ,
fortunately , she only had to stay a few weeks 
and she was able to return to her apartment again . 
but it's really a uh , big , uh , 
you know , is there something else we could have done , you know , in checking out all the places that , uh , might be available . 
of course , you know , there's not one on every corner ,
probably the hardest thing in my family , uh , my grandmother , she had to be put in a nursing home 
and , um , she had used the walker for quite some time , probably about six to nine months . 
and , um , she had a fall 
and , uh , finally , uh , she had parkinson's disease , 
and it got so much that she could not take care of her house . 
then she lived in an apartment 
and , uh , that was even harder 
because change of location 
and it was very disturbing for her because she had been so used to traveling . 
i mean , she had children all across the united states 
 and , you know , she spent nine months out of the year just visiting her children . 
and , um , that was pretty heartrending for her . 
i can imagine . 
that's tough . 
i mean , for somebody who has , uh , not just merely had a farm but had ten children 
and , you know , facing that situation , it's quite a dilemma . 
i think , 
my mother , excuse me . 
go ahead . 
well , uh , my , uh , 
probably one of the biggest decisions i think that was very strengthening for our family was rather than have one child make that decision 
i think that they had a great deal of , um , 
all the brothers and sisters got together 
and they actually had a conference . 
that's great . 
and , i mean , it was probably one of the most strengthening things for our family , getting down together and doing that . 
that's right . 
and just the children were involved in the decision , because it involved just them .
and everybody had duties 
you know , whether it was just , you know , giving money or whether it was actually taking part in a lot ,
you were very ,
and they , 
i know . 
they had seen it coming . 
i mean , it , 
i mean , i truly wish that if something like that were to happen that my children would do something like ,
unfortunately , a lot of times responsibilities like that seem to fall to , you know , maybe one child in the whole family , you know . 
well , we , 
and , uh , it's usually not a very smooth , 
i was lucky too that i only have one brother . 
and , uh , fortunately , we agreed , you know , on exactly , you know , what we thought should be done . 
my mother also was very independent . 
she still had her own little house and still driving her own car ,
we were lucky you know , really much aware of what was going on . 
that nursing home life would not have been , you know , anything of her choosing , 
of course , she would not have been happy there at all . 
but as it turned out the stroke took care of that concern for us . 
well , uh , that she did not have the problem with , 
she was very well aware 
and her daughter came and visited her 
at least her daughter ,
that's great . 
and i think that when she passed away it was probably one of the greatest , 
 um , i think it would be , 
it was more of a relief 
and , um , 
i mean , but she was truly aware . 
i mean , with alzheimer's .
that would be tough . 
and , um , i think that what one thing that they were concerned probably was the fact it wasn't necessarily , you know , like the quantity of care 
that the people that worked there 
it would , 
the , what everything would hinge upon . 
is it , 
how close is it to a home environment . 
that's right . 
that's probably the major question . 
i think that great strides are being made nowadays in a , 
just people are , of course , populations getting older . 
you know the population of the united states is changing because , you know , uh , now that so many more minorities , where they have had extended families for such a long time . 
um , matter of fact in the united states we used to have extended families . 
it wasn't , 
but , i guess as we become more industrialized and more , you know , less in a rural situation 
yes , um . 
that's right . 
perhaps the extended family , you know , that it maybe one of the solutions to a lot of things even child care . 
you know i mean , of course they're going to be a good caretaker for our children . 
just because they're grandparents . 
i mean they raised us after all . 
just because they're grandparents that doesn't automatically make them a good child carer . 
but , uh , many people especially where they've had , uh , extended family . 
i mean , uh , it's , 
money seems to be too big of an issue .
oh , yeah . 
realistically it is . 
and that may be , you know , perhaps if we put money on the back burner 
that would ,
i mean , 
 but actually have a truer standard of living . 
that's just a matter of defining priorities , i guess 
i think your right . 
well , i guess that was it .
it was good talking to you . 
all right . 
take care . 
well , the first thing for me is i mean an invasion of privacy is something that disturbs your private state , 
that's one thing , 
and if privacy is something that comes into your private state and extracts information from it , in other words , finds something out about you that's another . 
and the first type of privacy seemed invaded to me , and very much everyday in this country , 
but in the second time , at least overtly , uh , where someone comes in and , uh , finds out information about you that should be private , uh , does not seem , uh , um , obviously , everyday . 
i think i agree with that . 
i think in a good example on the typical thing that happens , uh , when the phone rang 
and it's t i calling , 
my immediate reaction is that it's some sort of strange phone message 
that's right .
so my immediate reaction was one of that sense of invasion 
and it was sort of exciting 
and so , 
it turned out to be , uh , uh , an invitation . 
uh , and at the same time i think that i receive on the order of , uh , probably , seven or eight a week calls of the nature where one wishes that there were a convenient way to just hang up on it . 
oh , that's a remarkable number . 
i get them rarely 
and i'm still astounded that one , they let anyone do them and two , that they have any effect in this whatsoever .
um , because i'm usually so insulted by them i just hang up as soon as i recognize what ,
i think they prey on people's , um , inherent politeness on the phone even with the machine . 
i find people being kind of polite and waiting for it to finish what it has to say , 
and then they feel an obligation to respond even though there's not even a person there . 
and i think that's what makes one feel invaded is the fact that there seems to be little control 
and one's feeling obligated ,
the most common example for me . 
um , i guess i'm not typically feeling invaded in my privacy relative to this one that you raised . 
and i don't think i would have thought about that . 
i think that's a good idea on your part . 
i don't typically feel intruded on the things , uh , the sense of finding out information . 
well , presumably those who find out such information , if they are doing it , i would prefer to not to be known , 
and , i mean , you know , the classic , oh , i don't know c i a conspiracy theories or whatever , would have such parties trying to do it without your knowledge . 
so there's ,  , things that invade that second type of privacy where you do know about them and possibly things that invade that second type of privacy without you knowing about it , 
and i can't talk about the second one other than to generate paranoia .
it's a surmise 
to surmise . it is there . 
i don't think i'd like the k g b monitoring my phone or anything like that . 
well , i guess , although , well , that's a good point where you said that how does one define what invasion of privacy is ,
and i'm not feeling invaded then maybe my privacy hasn't been because i have no sense of my privacy state having been invaded . 
but i don't feel invaded by it . 
i don't ,
i'm not sure why . 
uh , i guess it comes from a sense of fact or facts 
and if someone finds out something about me that is true , i don't have a sense of loss from that . 
well , you must have a relatively clean conscience then .
 um , if someone found out something or surmised something that weren't true then i would feel probably more invaded in the gossipy sort of sense . 
more harmed or something . 
did you hear about this lotus data base that was being put together ? 
i was just about to write a letter when i heard they canceled it . 
that would be an example where my sense of threat would be high because i would find that there be , were fantasy . 
and then i would feel not only invaded in the sense that someone had obtained information that i would rather they didn't 
and that might be the sense of the spending pattern , for instance ,
uhhuh , uhhuh . 
but then if it turns out to generate incorrect things , that's even worse 
they had you pegged .
and the person who had takes unsolicited phones calls and pays money 
and then all of ,
and , um , one of the problems with the lotus data base was , um , that it was uncontrolled access to who would have that information . 
i mean , they said they would give it out to only select companies 
but , um , you know , just like software is only given out to customers , 
i mean , you can't believe that . 
it would be pirated 
and they wouldn't bother to check that carefully anyway to someone who's offering , you know , full cash price ,
i mean , you know , you can't tell it , what a company really has to do with it 
and there's something rather ominous about having virtually anyone , any hacker being able to know what your income is , what your spending habits are , 
in touch with the sneak thief 
and suddenly what started as an invasion of privacy can be an invasion of your actual home . 
and i guess that turns out to be the basic problem with any invasion of privacy is whether or not you're feeling ,
i also thought about it , uh , waiting to talk to you that , another thing that occurred to me is there is not so much invasion of my privacy because i know how to behave such that there isn't . 
but i realized i have to behave in a certain way in order to not have people invade my privacy . 
if i deviate from social norms of behavior , if i run up and down the street yelling or something , someone's going to invade my privacy very quickly . 
and i realize that , i mean , i can take that for granted 
but i used to live in india 
and things are quite different there in terms of that . 
there's less of a sense of privacy . 
in fact , it's said that no indian language has a word for privacy , 
certainly the language i know doesn't ,
oh , that's interesting . 
loneliness is the closest you can come , which is really quite different . 
 but no concept for wanting to be private . 
it's generally being alone is not a very desirable state , at least officially . 
um , so there's not , 
i mean , doors don't have latches on them . 
people don't tend to knock , 
you just , 
if there's a door closed and you open it because it's in your way 
people walk in out 
and , i was often surprised ,
that would be , 
you know , it very much is . 
but on the other hand , i realized i could go out on the street and act like a complete lunatic , 
and people would leave ,
whereas in this country where everyone respects the closed doors very much , if you go out and then act like the lunatic of , um , public behavior . 
um , people start paying attention to you very much 
but it does mean that you have yet another reason to follow a set of social norms . 
 always the case in all cultures , 
and it wasn't until i was thinking about it just now that i realized that's actually something that's culturally relative . 
that is true . 
i haven't thought about that 
to think a lot of someone who doesn't know how to say private . 
and that's really , um , 
well , i mean , i wonder how people have sex ,
i mean ,  , 
you go to india 
and you know , the results of sex are quite obvious ,  , as the population goes up an extra hundred million every few years . 
um , but i just don't quite , um , 
there's hope , i actually for al , 
of the time i've spent there , i still don't quite understand how certain things that i assume and require privacy and require not just that you be alone but actually that you have a sense of privacy . 
because anyone can be alone for some period of time 
but for me a lot of what i do requires a sense that there's this invisible barrier around me which people wil , 
and if that's gone , um , i really don't know how to live very well , 
and i really do wonder how people do that . 
that's interesting . 
where you feel your privacy to be invaded on a daytoday basis or either on a growing frequency ? 
and they're doing something that normally i really only invite ,
because i , anyone i give my number to is welcome to call me , 
but no one is just welcome to come by my house . 
so that is more of a sense of invasion . 
so , that's another example of the invasion because of the not so  . . . 
hi diana . 
have you all been able to do much as a family these days ? 
pardon me . 
oh , yes , 
we go out to dinner , 
we take the kids to the park , 
and , uh , you know , whenever my husband has time off or something , we take them to the zoo , 
or you know , we do everything we can possibly as a family . 
do you work outside the home ? 
i don't either , 
it makes it a little bit easier , i think , that way . 
it does , 
an then , uh , you know , my husband enjoys spending time with the kids , you know , 
he'll take them out just to be with them . 
so you have a break too . 
we try to spend like monday nights , we call it family home evening ,
and , we just do all kinds of fun things like that 
we have family that's far away . 
it sounds like you might too . 
we do , 
so they , 
and , uh , 
and phone calls that's about it . 
and , uh , you know , you know , we go to the park 
or we go in the backyard and sit down 
 yeah , that's what we mostly do , pretty simple things . 
especially since my youngest one is  , excuse me , only fourteen months . 
she's really getting to the age where she's playing ,
and with , you know , me being at home and just having the one income , you know , you don't have , this lot of extra money to do a lot of , you know , extra things . 
that's right . 
so , you make more fun than , you know . 
you know the kids just think it's wonderful just maybe to go get an ice cream cone or ,
oh that's a big thrill for them . 
they think that's a lot of fun . 
so we try to spend as much time as we can . 
we , you know 
are devoted to our children except for we might go out , you know , one evening or something , 
but during the day , you know , it's all devoted to our kids 
and they come , go to church with us 
and so . 
that's true . 
um , have you ever been to the science , it's called the science place ? 
that's what . 
we haven't lived here too long 
and we went there a couple of weeks ago 
and , uh , .
the kids thought that was wonderful . 
oh , yeah , 
i guess there's science place one and science place two . 
we've only been in , i think it's science place two . 
i'm not sure which one we went into , 
it was about a year or so ago , when we went . 
the one we went in had , uh , 
the thing that sticks out most in my mind is like a kid's place area . 
they really seemed to go wild in there . 
they had a lot of fun in there 
and , uh , uh , there's some petting , you know , like , uh , uh , 
i think it's owens country farms has a free petting , you know , like a farm that you can go to 
and the kids can pet animals and stuff . 
where's that . 
that's on plano road , 
uh , it's like in richardson you go up plano road , 
it's like a little bit past campbell and plano road .
and that's a lot of fun . 
oh yeah . 
they have tours going through there 
and , uh , the kids think that was a lot of fun , too . 
oh , that does sound like fun . 
it's a little bit of a ways , 
 you know , whenever we take them to showbiz 
or they think it's wonderful just to go to mcdonald's , you know , 
they don't go for the food 
they go for to play around 
that's right . 
and it's a indoor fun park 
and it has a bunch of different rides for kids . 
that's sounds fun too . 
and parents get in free 
and it's like , during the week , 
it's like five dollars admission per child , all day . 
and you said about plano and campbell is the petting , 
the petting farm , 
 that sounds fun 
i think maybe we'll try to do that . 
and the one in mesquite is , uh , scyene exit . 
and it's , uh , 
the kids just had a wonderful time there , 
 you know , you just pay that admission , 
and then all the rides are free . 
you know , of course , they have all the little video games and , you know , those little quarter rides , you know , and stuff like that 
you can have birthday parties there 
an , i think that was better than like showbiz pizza cause there's more for them to do . 
because they can just do , 
you don't have to have tokens for everything . 
so they had a lot of fun . 
that does sound like fun . 
well i've gotten some good ideas from you .
we try to do a lot of things as a family and , you know , inexpensively as possible , 
well , i think , i don't know if we've done five minutes 
but i'm sure that will be good . 
that will be good , 
it was good talking to you . 
i really appreciate your suggestions . 
oh , no problem . 
well , take care . 
i don't like having credit cards for every store . 
uh , i just don't like them .
 what are you afraid of with them ? 
um , i don't know if i'm really afraid of spending too much . 
i just , uh , don't think that i need them , you know . 
uh , they are tempting at times , 
but you know , sometimes i just don't like everybody knowing everything about me , you know , 
well , that's can be very , very true . 
 you know , everybody just gives you a credit card just so you'll spend money 
well , that's the idea . 
they figure that ,
that's right . 
see they make money off of it , whether you use it or not . 
well , the other thing , of course , is the fact that they hope ,
that's right . 
i use mine a great deal , um , for groceries , for everything that i can and ,
that's what i do . 
just a second . 
that's all right . 
sounds like you have a little one there . 
i have two little ones . 
oh , you have . 
so tha , 
how old are they ? 
  um , four and two and half . 
oh , boy . those are two very active ages .
so , yeah , 
um , i'm like you 
only use my credit card for , um , you know , when i , you know , 
i just use it whenever i feel like i don't want to write a check , 
 but i don't charge anything that i can't payoff at the end of the month . 
well , uh , uh , do you ever use the a t m machines ? 
my husband does at work just to get cash out , 
but , uh , i take the checkbook 
so if i need cash , i just tell him 
and he gets it out 
and i don't even think i know my number .
 well , i find it a great use from the standpoint that you don't have to continue to write checks ,
that's right . 
see but , you know , since he can just do it right there at work ,
 oh , that helps . 
well their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash 
 and when they do that , they begin paying interest right from that very day on . 
you're right . 
and that's kind of silly . 
yeah right . 
because they , 
you're defeating the purpose . 
the idea is to use their money .
and , uh , during that whole month and ,
because i , 
well , i think that's the only thing you can do , is just say no and mean no and ,
well , i , 
you've already been preapproved . 
oh , absolutely , 
that's their favorite word . 
everybody in the country is preapproved , i think . 
i think so , you're right . 
well , it's interesting , uh , that , uh , 
that much stuff . 
and , then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it . 
well , and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own , 
and , i mean , that does nothing , but exacerbate the entire problem . 
it does because minimum payment , you're paying interest ,
that's right . 
that's right . 
well it's been enjoyable talking with you . 
it's enjoyable seeing that somebody feels the same way , 
so , well , 
well take good care . 
take care of your little ones . 
you too . 
good luck . 
well  , what do you think about nolan ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars ? 
that's the only thing i found out tonight .
i haven't even heard that , 
that's great . 
i think he deserves every penny of it . 
but , there are some others out there that i don't believe deserve the money they're getting . 
well , isn't it funny how baseball's getting less than like football players would . 
oh , yeah . 
wonder because football , 
and they play a lot longer season , too . 
that's exactly right . 
but i think , let's see , 
the teams that were there last year were , see , somebody from california , 
i don't even know who won the pennant last year . 
beats me . 
i mean , i know yankees have won a lot games .
not lately though .
we have been talking about this , 
i tried to call earlier , 
and we had made a list of all these , uh , baseball teams and the cities that they were from ,   
then i started cleaning 
and i don't even know where i even put that paper .
threw it away .
oh , gosh . 
let's see . 
the teams that , 
i think the a's were in it last year . 
the oakland a's , and i don't think it was an all california baseball . 
 well , have you ever played baseball ? 
i played softball . 
well , that's what i did when i was growing up . 
that was fun . 
that's fun .
that's a whole different sport . 
let's see , 
but i think the rangers need to go 
and i think the pirates will go . 
and , uh , let's see , 
 rangers have got a new guy this year , 
i don't even remember his name either . 
do you ever go see the rangers ? 
it's a lot more fun when your not fighting a crowd . 
i think it's fun , 
i like just looking at the billboards . 
sometimes if you go out there during the day , you just fry under the sun . 
it's nice at night . 
that's when i've been . 
it is . 
and do you know anything about that new stadium , 
have you seen all those pictures that they're going to put out there ? 
that huge 
it's suppose to be a huge stadium 
and it's going to have little shopping centers in it and like a lake or something running through it . 
and , uh , they're going to try to make it a real community center out there . 
and your going to be able to buy your , 
what was , no , wait   about the liquor ? 
that's in , uh , texas stadium where the football players ,
oh , yeah , 
so you , 
and they're never going to let liquor in there . 
well , they're trying . 
i know , 
but they try every year 
and every year they get thrown out . 
it's so stupid because they let you take it in there , 
but don't allow them to sell it there . 
but , uh , that new stadium's going to be real nice , 
and i heard uh , that you can bid on that stadium 
last night on the news i heard that they said you could bid on the stadium to have it named after you , 
and it's going to go to the highest bidder .
oh . ell , that's the way to do it . 
so that could be your , you know , fifteen minutes of fame . 
  holly  turn it down . 
i think it's the bart man , the simpsons .
oh , god .  stay away from them . 
i wish i could .
i bet you do . 
well , where are you ? 
in plano . 
i'm in garland . 
oh , you are ? 
oh , what's he teach ? 
c v a e . 
so , what do you do ? 
i teach , 
but i teach for dallas . 
oh , you do ? 
i'm trying to get out . 
is that a tough system to be in ? 
real hard ? 
i would think it , 
i mean it's good because they try new things , you know , 
but it's like , they'll try something 
and then they throw it out , and get something else , you know , 
and you get tired of that . 
that's typical bureaucracy though . 
i think it's going to be any where you go 
it's just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones , 
i don't know , 
sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad . 
well , but they can't be though , 
they don't have as much money . 
most of the time . 
but the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes . 
oh man , in dallas you don't even know who's in administration , 
there's so many of them .
you don't even know who to payoff , huh ? .
 i mean , somebody walks in a classroom 
and you don't know what they're there for , you know , when they're coming , how long they're going to be , 
oh , how funny . 
you know , it's just   there they are 
and they're writing the whole time .
no communication whatsoever . 
because , you know , you never know where they are going what they'll report 
i know . 
 and they'll tell you they've written something down , 
and you hope they're telling you the truth . 
and you never see it . 
no  , 
that's got to be frustrating . 
oh , it is . 
how long you taught in dallas schools ? 
uh , this is my eleventh year . 
ugh , that's about , uh , ten too many . 
actually it's , 
now my job's good ,
and all i do is teach reading all day long , 
and it's just ten children at a time . 
oh , well , that's not bad . 
it's good , 
and you've got a lot of federal money , too . 
but hasn't it changed a lot over the years ? 
oh , yes . 
or working in the system . 
so i'll know what i'm suppose to teach 
we don't even know where one is . 
oh , god .
how funny . 
 and now they tell you what to teach and how long and , you know , what day ,
you don't know which is , 
i know which is worse . 
i guess so . 
being told what to do is worse . 
oh , you can ? 
and no , 
and please say goodbye within the next five seconds . 
oh , i haven't ever talked that long . 
well , you know , i hadn't either till last night , i was talking to this retired administrator from cleveland , ohio , 
 uhhuh  .
and we started talking about gangs , you know . 
he lives in cleveland ? 
and , everybody else that i've talked to has been right around here . 
but , she was real interesting . 
and then tonight this woman called , 
have you taken any incoming calls ? 
so hers was the first one i gotten 
uh , and she was telling me all her problems , you know , 
and it went over ten minutes . 
did you all not talk about the topic at all ? 
well , yeah , 
but the topic was boring i thought . 
what would you serve , uh , if you were having a dinner party ? 
oh , gosh ,   all the other , 
the one i talked about the other night was good , 
it was , um , about movies , you know , what have you seen at the movies lately and stuff like that . 
oh yeah , 
i could go on and on about that . 
me , too , because we go all the time , 
the guy i was talking to never goes , 
ugh , neat . 
so , that was real good to talk about that . 
have you seen like , uh , silence of the lambs ? 
you've got to go see that . 
the last one i saw was dances   wolves . 
we talked about that one too . 
and he said he didn't think it should have gotten all those awards , he thought it was too long 
but i , 
oh , i enjoyed it . 
i did , too . 
i mean , it was just more for my money . 
i didn't think it was too long at all . 
uh , he said after about the first hour he started looking at his watch . 
the other one you need to go see is sleeping with the enemy . 
and , how old are your kids ? 
one is eight 
and one is eleven . 
you probably don't want to take them to see silence of the lambs . 
it's not too cool for kids . 
they usually pick their own . 
i bet they do . 
you know , they've got it all figured out . 
they want to see all the horror movies . 
ninja turtles , got to have those . 
but most of the time really we watch them on the video . 
oh , yeah , 
you brin , 
don't you ? 
just massive rental . 
well heck , that's a lot cheaper then , uh , 
going to , 
i know . 
especially if you get them for a couple of nights you don't have to watch them all in one time . 
that's what we do , especially when it's bad weather , man , just ,
of course , you have to get there early if you want to get anything ,
i know .
it's good when you go to tom thumb though 
and they're cheap 
and nobody has got them yet . 
that's true . 
that's true . 
we saw , um , heroes have always been cowboys , tonight . 
it was okay , 
it was kind of slow , 
and i felt like it kind of got chopped off at the end , you know . 
i don't know , 
one of those movies it's not going to be around long , 
it will be a dollar movie in no time . 
do you read ? 
i don't have the patience to read .
see i do that to make myself go to sleep at night . 
oh , my mom and dad read all the time . 
well , i was reading the book , 
and it's called shoeless joe . 
oh , really ? 
it was so wonderful . 
and then um , i decided , well , i like this author , 
so i got a , uh , book of his short stories , 
and that's been real good . 
who is the author ? 
don't ask me .
the ghost of shoeless joe was the name of the book . 
shoeless joe . 
was it like the movie ? 
but , you know , in the movie the guy was black , 
he wasn't in the book , 
that's one difference . 
there really wasn't a lot of difference . 
i didn't , 
see i never even heard that there was a book tied in with that movie . 
that's interesting . 
that was a good movie , too . 
well , do you think we covered baseball ? 
well , have a good night . 
so , who's your , uh , favorite team ? 
 the dallas cowboys . 
the dallas cowgirls , huh . 
well , they did have a fairly decent year finally this year . 
at least they're coming around . 
they're going to get better . 
i mean , you know . 
well i mean , you know , i think , uh , once jimmy johnson gets his system established , uh , they'll do all right . 
as long as troy aikman doesn't get hurt again . 
that kind of killed them at the end of the season last year . 
so , i don't even know who your favorite team is , actually . 
i'm a viking fan . 
i think i did know that , i just forgot . 
and they haven't been doing too hot , 
has herschel walker done much for them ? 
well , he was a good player . i guess , 
well i don't know , 
he just never , 
i don't know , 
for a while there    , 
 i've never been over impressed with him . 
well , you know , he'd get past like six or seven tackles and just keep spinning around and get on into the end zone . 
but , um , i guess you never could really see him play , because with the cowboys , while he was with the team , the rest of the team was pretty poor 
so you couldn't really tell if it was just him or the team 
and i always just assumed that he was too good for the rest of the team . 
but , i don't know . 
well , who's the running , 
is it sammy smith , 
or is it , emmett smith . 
emmett smith , 
emmett smith . 
he's been doing real good . 
did he actually play in the pro bowl . 
i remember he was like a backup 
and then somebody got injured 
and he was supposed to go . 
i'm not sure . 
 i haven't been keeping up with football , i mean , in the fall 
i can go on and on about football , 
but since it's kind of off season , it's kind of hard to think back about all that . 
but , uh , 
who else is , uh , oh 
there's , you know , mike    , 
minnesota vikings , used to be the general manager starting the world football league . 
and he was trying to keep , uh , uh , 
i can't even think of the guy's name , either , the coach of the vikings . 
um , i have no idea . 
jerry burns . 
no earthly idea . 
he was going to keep him as the coach somehow , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i'd like to see the vikings get revamped somehow . 
how did they end up this year ? 
did they make it to the playoffs at all ? 
they went like one and six , 
and then they won five or six in a row . 
so they were in a shot to make the playoffs 
and they screwed up the last couple of games . 
except i think the cowboys are on the upswing .
i don't know about the vikings .
just hadn't heard much about them lately . 
and the cardinals were kind of like the cowb , 
in fact they were doing better than the cowboys , 
and the cowboys came on strong at the end of the season , 
and the cardinals got killed by the cowboys , 
well , the cardinals , i don't know . 
i think the cowboys probably have a better team . 
they just , 
at the end of the season , the kind of got messed up with aikman getting hurt , because , uh , laufenberg just couldn't ever really get it together at all . 
of course , he sat along the sidelines all season , 
he never really got in a game , never did a whole lot . 
oh , don't made any excuses for him .
i mean , he didn't get to see much action . but , too bad . 
because and didn't look too good 
and so , no one's going to have much faith in him any more . 
in fact , i think they're getting a different guy for a backup quarterback . 
uh , i haven't kept up with it lately , 
but i remember reading something a few months ago about them signing somebody else on , or trying to go after somebody or trade for somebody , 
but it wasn't anybody i'd really heard of . 
but i heard on the radio this morning , or yesterday morning , that , uh , aikman's back in practicing , doing real , real well . 
um , who is it , michael irvin 
   he said that , uh , aikman was hitting him right on the numbers every time . 
so , sounds like he's going to be all right for next season . 
they're just trying not to overwork him right now , until he gets his shoulder , uh , back in shap , 
i don't know .
i think it was his shoulder he had surgery on . 
but anyway , they're trying to you know , keep him , uh , from reinjuring anything , but anyway .
but , uh , well i got my thirty day notice yesterday . 
thirty day notice for what ? 
um , i'm done , where i work . 
oh , really . 
so , anyway , i guess we can't talk much more about that , 
but i just thought i'd throw that in there .
 oh , okay , 
maybe i'll call you back after the recording is finished . 
actually i think we have talked about football for five minutes . 
i can't remember . 
oh , w , 
i've always ran out of time ever since i've done this . 
i usually have , too .
i've done that once or twice . 
i didn't look at the clock when we started talking , 
so i guess we should talk about football a little bit longer just to be sure we got five minutes in . 
make sure we get our cash flow . 
so other than the vikings , who do you like ? 
uh , oh . 
remember jim hart ? 
jim hart was playing . 
terry metcalf was on the cardinals . 
this was a long time ago . 
um , i don't know who else i've ever . 
that's about it , 
i was always a viking fan . 
i think i was into the cardinals for a little bit 
since they've been to phoenix they haven't been , uh , all that impressive , i guess . 
i guess i've always been a cowboy fan . 
other than that , i mean , you know , you know , one of the greatest football teams until the last few years , you kind of tend to get caught up in it . 
well , the cowboys were america's football team , 
there's no question about that , 
i mean it was really exciting ,
because my parents would always have season tickets , 
and they'd go to all the games , 
and you know , the hype were just unbelievable . 
it's just , you know , the last , oh 
i guess probably since about eightyfour , about eightyfive was when they started kind of going downhill really , 
but , you know , i'm just used to always growing up and hearing cowboys , cowboys , cowboys , and , you know , super bowl , and all this other stuff . 
so , i can't , you know , 
i'm not going to decide i don't like them just because they're having a few bad years . 
i mean , i think they'll pull out of it , 
and , you know , they'll wind up being good again . 
they've got that are going to , uh , do pretty good , i think . 
 but , they're raising prices on their tickets . 
so they're banking on doing good next season . 
i think tickets are , 
again . 
what are they going up to , thirty bucks or something ? 
thirty , or thirtytwo for really good tickets . 
see , they sectioned it out even more . 
they used to just have like , uh , 
first of all it was all one price . 
and then they sectioned it out to end zone and then everything else . 
and now they're sectioning it off from one twenty yard line to the other one , 
just on the lower levels is the highest price , 
and then the next highest price is that same area but above it on the upper level , 
and then like from the twenty to the ten yard line . 
and then they're some sections kind of in the corner areas , 
and then the cheapest of course is going to be the direct end zones . 
but , um , they have about four or five different prices now , 
that they're structuring it with , 
but obviously yeah , they're all going up ,   more or less is what it's going to do . 
so now the tickets even got lower than the lowest one last year . 
um , you know , i'm not sure , 
i'm not positive , 
i didn't really think about that . 
i just remember trying to figure out where you could get 
that was real close to the good section but in the little bit cheaper . 
but , not that i'll ever go . 
i hadn't been to a cowboys game , 
teams in there , 
and it was the , uh , dallas and washington redskins game . 
and i went because my dad can usually get a hold of some free tickets , because a lot of those doctors have season tickets , 
and um , if they're not going to use them they'll give them to somebody else . 
so i went with my dad to a game that one time . 
but that wasn't a real , you know , 
it was the scab teams , 
you know , it was kind of different , i guess . 
and before that it's been quite a few years . 
i've been wanting to go to a game , 
i just never have gotten around to it . 
so maybe this year   .
 that's interesting , 
i almost lost our electricity here  .
um , what do you do this weekend ? 
well , uh , pretty much spent most of my time either in the yard or at nurseries buying stuff for the yard . 
huh . which is , 
 have planned for your yard ? 
well , uh , we just bought our house , uh , last july , 
and the house is forty years old 
so there's an established lawn and whatnot , flower beds , things like that , 
but uh , they've gone a few years of neglect . 
so , we're in the process of , uh , revitalizing the whole situation . 
we've got , um , different flower beds in front and , uh , a built in window box , um , trying to get some color back in those , get the trees trimmed up , uh , get rid of a few weed problems and things like that . 
what part of the state do you live in ? 
uh , i live in dallas . 
oh , okay . 
my wife and i , we live in dallas too , 
just what that area , 
we're planning on moving to flower mound , 
and we're going to be getting some wheel h , 
we're going to have to do a lot of lawn and garden work there . 
seems like it . 
uh , the place we've been living at , we're just leasing it . 
has such a high clay content ,
i'll bet . 
i'll bet . 
i mean just scratching two or three inches was just a chore . 
it was 
and then when it gets wet , you know , you don't even want to get out in the yard , 
it's horrible . 
it's a nightmare . 
but , um , i don't know 
um , where you live is there a real high , uh , alkaline or  ash  content 
 actually it's done , uh , 
it's in the north end of oak cliff in , uh , kessler park area , 
and , uh , we've got about , 
i know right where that's at . 
maybe eight to eight inches to a foot of soil , 
and then it's solid rock from then on down , 
find the cracks in the rock . 
but , uh , 
it's solid limestone . 
how do you put trees in there ? 
uh , we're just happy that there's trees already there so far , 
um , anything like that is a , uh , major undertaking i guess , uh , 
sprinkler systems or anything , uh , start to get real expensive because there's an awful lot of work that has to be done chopping through the rock . 
but , uh , 
and it , you know , 
but , uh , 
and a different challenge , 
i've never , 
well , i moved to dallas about five years ago , 
and , uh , i never really , messed with anything , uh , gardening or anything like that until now , 
but , uh , of different parts of town . 
in fact , uh , we were at the farmers market yesterday and bought a few tomato plants and things like that , 
and each one works in one part of town 
and that's it , 
that's basically what he was trying to tell us . 
we tried planting tomatoes last year 
and they turned out pretty poor . 
 , the variety and everything . 
but it's amazing we also have roses , 
and , i mean , they just grow so beautifully . 
that wou , 
in fact , we put in uh , some more roses yesterday . 
like um , what type roses ? 
uh , a few different , uh , hybrid tea type varieties . 
oh , hybrid teas . 
yeah , 
we have a few , uh , of the real short stem . 
they're kind of like the bush roses . 
but , uh , i don't know it's a really old bush , 
i'm amazed because the sun is so intense , 
and the roses just seem to survive just fine there . 
that's what we're searching , uh , 
we've got all the different lake editions around the house 
and we're kind of experimenting right now . 
we've got the direct sun in front 
and the backyard has two great big , uh , spruce and an oak tree all about forty to fifty foot tall 
so the backyard is just complete dark all day long . 
and , uh ,  , we're struggling to find something for those areas . 
uh , we've been pretty lucky on that . 
just if you want a lot of , you know , light for underneath ,
we have a plum that's just about ready to go , 
so we may just be getting rid of that 
they seem to be doing just fine , 
but they really need pruning . 
it just seems like that even , you know , pruning once a year is really not enough 
but the way they behave . 
that's true . 
i don't know . 
what kind of grass are you growing ? 
it's , uh , bermuda . 
bermuda . 
yeah . 
oh , i've been trying , uh , uh , a mixture of , uh , the bermuda and the rye , 
but i may be working like a fescue in because of , you know , the type of weather . 
it seems that , uh , bermuda's fine 
but , um , it looks like it would hold the soil 
but it really doesn't . 
a lot of , silt that comes in it just doesn't seem to hold it very well . 
uh , but the rye does really well . especially during the wintertime . 
it just dries up ,
but anyway . 
it's , uh , 
there's such a difference ,
they're building a house into the side of a hill , um , 
well , it's already been built and everything . 
they've been living there for about three months now , 
but , uh , this is out in west texas , 
but the wind there , has been so bad that , i mean , they've tried to plant grass 
and they just ,  , have some problems , 
  that's it  .
they just , 
but it's quite an undertaking . 
they have about two or three acres of land on lake front property ,
oh , wow . 
it's beautiful , 
i mean , 
but you know , it's a pretty neat little job 
but just , uh , you know , for them , i mean , they're going to have to start gardening . 
it's going to be from the ground up . 
the whole way . 
it's amazing , 
i mean , 
and , uh , it's all on lake  greenbelt   ,
and , uh , i don't know , what they have , 
they have all the water they want , 
actually , they can pump water , 
i mean , they have to get permission 
but they can pump water up from the shore , 
but , uh , that's for like an additional , 
they have to pay like some kind of fee per year . 
oh , okay . 
but , uh , they're trying to get the trees planted and everything . 
but , man , that they're going to have to spend just getting that . 
but the taxes alone there , lake  greenbelt  
and some places , they really  nail  them for tax . 
and , i mean , your talking what , just several hundred dollars a year in property taxes . 
it's ridiculous . 
that really is , 
it would , 
it seem like it be just the opposite when you get , 
it's not it's , 
because even though it's far out there , it's just that lake  greenbelt   , you know , selling the water . 
but , um , the water usage , you know , they try to limit , even though there's three or four streams that flow into it , people still use it enough where they irrigate . 
they still haven't gotten used to the dry land farming 
that's true that , 
but i don't know 
i just came back from there 
and just the air is so dry . 
i don't see how anything can survive out there ,
 should say  
my fatherinlaw says the mesquite trees are , they're pretty smart , 
they're smart , 
they're about the smartest tree around . 
they don't even start growing until may , 
that's true . 
that's true . 
they say the roots have developed 
so that's all they work on . 
just a leafy , 
they don't do anything . 
that's something i've uh , been looking around and noticed all the flowering trees and stuff are ,
and , you know , we're trying to decide what to put on one side of the house and things like that , 
but there's so many things that they last for just a couple of weeks 
a bush there from then on . 
it's kind of disappointing . 
i don't know 
of our house we planted some gardenias . 
and they did real fine during the summertime 
it's just , 
but during the fall when it stopped , when , uh , the rain let off just a little bit i mean , it just dried up . 
they don't , 
it's like they remain  . . . 
well , how do you feel about the immigration laws ? 
currently , i think they are a little restrictive . uh , particularly for , uh , certain ethnic groups or from certain countries . 
um , i think we should permit , uh , more immigration from eastern europe , for example , uh , particularly uh ,  , uh , people from russia . 
i think we could permit more of them in than we have permitted in the last , uh , several years . 
and , i think we have , uh , uh , too much restriction uh , on the orientals also , 
but , of course , that's just my opinion .
well , i'm not real sure why i got this topic , because i don't think i checked it off on the list 
well , we seem uh , to favor certain , uh , uh , countries particularly south american countries . 
and , uh , uh , 
i have nothing , of course , against , uh , uh , or hispanics , in that sense , 
but i think we , uh , are more restrictive of the , uh , so called eastern , uh , european countries than uh , we should be . 
of course , that's from my own bias since my ancestors from eastern europe , 
 uh , spent years and years , uh , lobbying for their release and their ability to , um , immigrate from russia 
i do not quite go along with that , 
that doesn't make a whole of lot sense . 
and i still think , 
you know , again , kind of having , uh , uh , within this century , come from uh , an immigrant family , or immigrant families on both sides . 
both my mother's parents and my father's parents were immigrants 
so , i'm a little touchy .
well , uh , well , from england and ireland 
oh , my .
so , i don't have or , or , uh , several generations back , that i am familiar with their names and how they fit into the family . 
they were all born here 
 so i don't have any real strong ties with the immigration laws . 
i don't have any personal feelings about them 
and i haven't taken the time or effort to learn what they are . 
well , i think in a way , though , uh , uh , i also have , uh , an opposite point of view , which is , uh , although i believe we should , uh , permit , uh , you know , constant immigration into this country 
of course , my family and i , 
again that was , you know , 
my grandparents came over during the time when , uh , there were quotas . 
so they had to wait , uh , you know , in , uh , certain parts of europe for years before they were permitted to come over . 
so , you know , 
 but , uh 
in other countries . 
i think they'd come here trying to find a new market for their brand of crime . 
well , you know , there's another aspect of this , too . 
they're also , uh , uh , diminishing the , uh , health restrictions which , 
i was not aware of that . 
well , yes . 
there were some , uh , regulations over , 
i don't know whether they're laws passed or whatever they're called , uh , just recently , where , uh , people with certain diseases cannot be excluded , uh , from , uh , immigration . 
age is one , for example , 
and , uh , recently , uh , tuberculosis , which at one time , if you had tuberculosis you could not get into this country 
so i think in that sense , 
but , uh , i think we should be a little more circumspect about it . 
again , my opinion .
think we've talked long enough ? 
all right . 
well , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
i have talked long enough . 
thank you . 
how are you today ? 
i'm great .
well as a matter of fact before we started this conversation i was working on my p c at home . 
do you have one ? 
i work with one at work 
but i do not have one of my own at home . 
do you have , 
what do you have , at home ? 
we have an , um , 
actually it's a t i computer , 
but it is the i b m 
it's not the t i p c 
from the oldies but the goodies . 
it's probably pretty close to what i have , because i have the same kind of thing at work . 
i have a three eightysix s x which is t i computer , 
but everything is in i b m mode . 
that's what we have . um . 
do you use it a lot at home ? 
i , um , am an accountant 
so you're on it a lot . 
we have , you know , used some of it for some personal things . 
we keep track of personal budgets and things like that on it . 
since it's tax season , i'm doing a lot of taxes , 
so i do um , a lot of that work on it as well . 
i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person 
and she works out of her home also . 
and the , uh , software that does the taxes is just incredible . 
oh it is . 
you know , i mean , she just , you know , 
i expected to go and , you know , drop the stuff off and go back two weeks later . 
and , you know , she had it done and out in twenty minutes on her little p c . 
you can . 
it was great . 
you can , 
that's right . 
that's wonderful . 
i have often thought that having one at home would be neat . 
i just don't know if we would really use it that much . you know . 
we really , 
we didn't decide to get one until i started working at home . 
we di , 
for us it really took , you know , a business application 
oh , definitely , 
i know my stepfather bought my mother a little personal computer , oh , i guess , probably three years ago for christmas , 
and , you know , it's got some stuff on it . 
it's got a nice little word processing software on it , you know , and some budgeting type things and stuff . 
and i don't think she's ever touched it 
it just seems like a lot of trouble for something at home . 
you know , she always seems to have better things to do than to try to sit down and figure out how to use her computer you know . 
she could just as easily do those things by hand . 
just as quickly . 
now i know my boss has bought the software , um , 
and he goes in and types his checks on the screen and then hits print , 
and they print out on the checks , 
and he's ordered envelopes with the windows in the right places 
oh my gosh . 
and he just whips , out , you know , 
i saw him yesterday morning over there , 
and he paid his monthly bills , 
and he just , you know , wrote all the checks on the screen and hit print 
and it printed out like ten checks , 
and he just , you know , 
they're perforated , 
and he just ripped them off . 
they go through just a continuous thing on the printer 
 and he ripped them off and stuck them in the envelopes 
and there they went . 
and you know there's not going to be those adding mistakes that we all make . 
that's exactly why . 
you know , it does it for you . 
so . this , you know , 
there are some advantages to it . 
it's just a matter of , like you say , does it justify the cost , if you're using it strictly for personal business . 
i think in most cases i'd have to say no . 
not unless somebody really enjoys it .
i have a four year old son , 
and we have some education programs that he likes . 
a little sesame street one 
 and we have another one that plays music , 
and he really likes that one . 
as he grows up he'll be even more and more too . 
that's right . 
that'll be great . 
and yeah , 
now i think about it , 
i guess for kids like , as they get older , 
especially now 
i mean , my sister went to college , started about three years ago , 
and she had to have a computer . 
i mean , it was like a necessity . 
well , yeah , 
she couldn't imagine going through college without a computer . 
well i'm going through right now . 
i'm , you know , going part time in the evenings , 
and , you know , i do , 
everything has to be typed . 
i mean , they require it . 
you have to type it 
on the p c up here , you know , typing stuff . 
so i can see where it would be a great advantage to have one at home , you know , if you were going to school . 
any more i don't even know if a college kid would have a typewriter .
well , you , 
i don't know . 
probably not even , 
i just finished a major research paper a couple of weeks ago , 
and i couldn't imagine not having that thing on a disk 
i don't know what they used to do before they , 
well , unfortunately in our family , my husband and i went through college together 
and then he went on and got his master's degree while i was working . 
and i'm the better typist ,
and we just had a regular old typewriter , not even a correcting one back then . 
oh 
it wasn't that long ago , 
oh gosh , 
oh boy , to have a computer back then . 
oh , cut your time in half at least . 
at least . 
i mean , 
and then of course you have some changes to make , and do the whole thing over . 
you take out a sentence , 
on a computer you take it out , bleep , print it out , fine . 
take out a sentence on a piece of paper , 
you do the whole thing over . 
that's right . 
you know , i remember when i was working in high school , you know , i was working in an office , right after i got out of high school 
i continued working there for probably another year . 
and we did everything on a typewriter 
oh , yeah . 
but it's amazing , you know , 
then , when , they did it right . 
i mean , they were , 
the first time . 
they sit there 
and you typed it 
and that was it , 
and now , you know people just send it back over and over and over and over . 
that's probably one of the problems and frustrations that it's brought about , because people do feel like , oh well , we can just change it . 
well , we'll try this out and see what it looks like . 
yeah , 
use it as just a , 
instead of knowing what they want to say 
but , you know , it gets a little out of hand sometimes . 
i've seen it get out of hand up here , you know 
oh yeah . 
are they typos ? 
are they because i couldn't read it 
or people just change like , one word because they think it sounds better , or whatever . 
and , you know , she's also keeping you know , what percentage of letters am i retyping for whatever reason . 
and there's like one week , she did retypes on ninety percent of what she typed 
i believe it . 
and you know , it's ridiculous 
and that was the high week , 
but it's running about seventy 
well , it's good that she does that , i mean , bring it to people's attention . 
well , that's exactly right . 
you know , this is ridiculous and you know , changing , add this time to now . 
you know , i mean , that's the kind of things , you know , that she's keeping and showing , that , this was a big waste of time , it was a waste of paper , it was a waste , you know 
so . anyway , it'll help in some way , 
but i don't know . 
there definitely even with the few disadvantages like that are far better than the alternative . 
oh i have to , 
without a doubt . 
well , i would like to get one at home some day . 
we've got a two year old son , 
and so , you know , some day i would like to get , even just like the video to be able to pull in sources from outside would be wonderful . 
you know so , 
especially when they're in school , i think they would get a lot out of it . 
oh , i do too , 
the on line encyclopedia just sounds wonderful , 
you know , that sounds like such a great idea , 
you know , it'd be kind of fun to be able to play with it . 
so . i know , my father had a p c , 
and when we were in high school it was always fun . 
we could , um , link in , 
and i don't even remember now what it was called . 
but you could link in and talk to people all over the country , you know . 
and , like , you have your own little code name , you know , 
and you'd type in du du du , hi how are you , du du du , 
and they'd type back and everybody , 
and you'd have five or six or seven people talking to each other at the same time , 
and everything everybody said prints out on your screen as they're typing it , 
and it was just great fun , you know , 
it was very expensive , because the whole time you were on there you were on long distance , you know . 
it was like a 
so , we were each limited to like twenty minutes a day , you know , 
that still could add up . 
oh it added up big . 
well , you know , my parents were divorced 
and so the time we were like visiting our father in the summer time , you know , 
so he felt like he could splurge and let us do it . 
i'm sure we would not have been allowed to do that under normal situations , you know . 
but when you're doing the guilty father complex , you know , because he's not there to watch us grow ,
that's sad . 
well , it was nice to talk to you . 
you too . 
have a , 
have a nice day . 
you too . 
first of all , i want to tell you i have two little kids , 
but they're not in public school yet . 
i get that experience starting next fall 
yeah . 
so you haven't really , uh , dealt with that in a sense . 
but , uh , being one of these late in life mothers , i've listened to everybody else's , you know , 
do you have school age kids  ? 
and , uh , 
such as ? 
uh , just over the years there were situations that , uh , uh , came up that i didn't think were fair or handled correctly 
or the teachers didn't seem to be teaching anything . 
of course , it's a little hard to tell from the information that you get from your child , you know . 
they bring things home 
and i was never one to believe everything my kids said ,
but , uh , still i questioned the ability of some of the teachers to , uh , really do a bangup job , 
and yet others i know are just wonderful . 
well , i heard a frightening thing . 
actually , i didn't hear it . 
it was told to me or suggested to me , uh , that to work as a teacher in the public school systems in the state of texas , 
and i think it's similar in many other states , if you have a degree in a technical field you do not need a teaching certificate because there is such a shortage 
and there's always going to be , you know , somebody having a need for a math or science teacher . 
this would be frightening . 
i don't know anything about it . 
that's pretty interesting because just , 
and even if i knew how to teach the subject matter , i don't know if i'd know how to handle that kind of a group of kids . 
oh , yeah . 
in fact , i think and the way they are sometimes disinterested in what's going on in the class and disruptive . 
i tell you what i'm finding frightening 
and this comes from , you know , the aging hippie near forty mother . 
so i went through this period of supposedly , you know , cosmic social enlightenment . 
i'm in the plano school system and living in richardson , 
and there is a real dichotomy in terms of educational and economic background of the kids that are going to be attending this school . 
you know , they can get a real life experience . 
what i'm seeing now , uh , in terms of kindergarten preparedness , just from , in different preschools 
and i wonder , how do they handle a child who is obviously very ready and another child who doesn't even speak english , let alone know her colors . 
and they're in the same classrooms . 
and i guess also you're going to see the first of the , uh , crack kids starting kindergarten . 
my god , i think it would be next year is what i'd read . 
some of those certainly have a lot of difficulties , you know , with , uh , all sorts of things , 
and i would imagine their learning disabilities are quite large in some cases . 
when i was listening to n p r , the national public radio , 
and they've quoted statistics that my throat just about fell into my toes . 
they said at the bottom of the s a t scores of graduating college seniors are usually those people that go into education . 
oh , wow .
that's encouraging . 
and it , 
my god , you know , i , 
are the rest of us who went for the big bucks , you know , staying out of , you know , where maybe we should be kind of socially obligated to spend some time teaching or something with 
i don't know .
well , you know , that's an idea . 
maybe there need to be some radical changes made . 
do some things that are totally different and unheard of . 
 well , you know , you sit here 
and you think about that . 
 oh , you're kidding . 
oh , no . 
and i keep thinking , you know , gifted is einstein or , you know , uh , musical prodigies . 
it's not a kid who's , you know , precocious . 
you know , what has the educational system been watered down to that anybody who's above average is now gifted ? 
i don't know . 
that's interesting . 
i don't know . 
mine did not fall into the gifted category .
oh , don't say that . 
and i would never had said so either . 
uh , but , uh , they managed to get through , although not always with flying colors . 
uh , in fact , one of the incidents i was thinking of that my son had . uh , he was struggling with senior english 
and i had a meeting with the , uh , vice principal and the english instructor , 
and , uh , she showed me a paper that he had just handed in . 
and she told me what she had requested . 
and i read it 
and while it had , you know , a few little grammatical problems , it wasn't very long and so forth . 
i thought it had some nice , well thought out , uh , parts to it . 
she gave him an f on that paper . 
and you give them an f on something that doesn't seem that bad to me . 
what are you telling that student ? 
you're telling them that , hey , you might as well forget it , you know . 
 well , you see , i think that harks right back to the elementary and junior high years . 
because i have a stepson now who's twentyfive 
and , uh , i was just absolutely shocked , uh , the first time that i saw his schoolwork . 
uh , i remember being , you know , taught , 
and i think , you know , you have to teach how to write an answer and , you know , how to construct a thought process . 
and , you know , they can grasp the points . 
can they convey the data verbally or in writing . 
and that's what's , you know , really scary to me . 
uh , i would really , you know , 
there's such a push among young mothers these days to make sure their child is computer literate . 
i would really think that they should be stressing more can the kid write a thought and at an early age . 
and if they can't , i mean if they have missed that training , then somebody , you know , before you're start penalizing them with bad grades for not being able to communicate what they're thinking , teach them these basic skills . 
it's pretty sad to think , uh , about those who , even today , are graduating from school 
and they are telling that they don't know how to read , you know . 
 well , my stepson , you know , he went into the navy or air force . 
i just really get my military , 
i married into a military family , 
 and i don't know , 
i address them all as generals 
so i don't offend anybody . 
but , uh , you know , fortunately for him , he wasn't dumb 
but boy he sure had trouble , you know , putting things on paper . 
and one of the things that they did for him . they tested him 
and they said that he's , you know , great in electronics 
but he , you know , really does need the basic skills . 
and they put him through six months of composition writing in addition to all his electronic training . 
and at that point , he has now graduated from warfare electronics school with honors . 
this is the kid who really , you know , barely 
and i keep thinking , you know , it's really not too late at any point to do , you know , some , 
that's interesting that the military saw that and did something about it . 
you would have expected them to be the last ones to .
and i kind of have always poohpoohed military educations . 
but i think that for this kid , it's going to be , you know , his lifesaver . 
otherwise , he might have been driving trucks or framing houses , you know , from here to eternity . 
so , i don't know . 
you know , it does make me nervous . 
well , i can see why if you've got little ones just coming along . 
there's a whole lot of stuff going on out there . 
 and part of me says i just would like to , you know , shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't , you know , go on .
maybe i should volunteer to , you know , teach what i know . 
maybe adult literacy . maybe , you know , composition writing . maybe , you know , uh , volunteering , you know , on a tutor line or though even through the elementary schools for help with homework 
do i reall , .
what type of lawn and garden work do you do ? 
i see . 
do you have a garden ? 
uh , yes . 
we do the same thing . 
i just have a small plot it's like ten feet by five feet . 
i have two plots , 
one's ten by ten 
and one's like fifteen by four . 
i see . 
it's a long skinny one 
you do a lot more area than i do . 
all the rest of my backyard is , uh , you know , pool and decking 
it's all the dirt i have ,
oh , i see . 
i see . 
well , i enjoy fiddling around . 
it's cheap entertainment . 
it's nice to get out in the open air . 
it is , 
and especially when the weather's not too hot or ,
that's right . 
but , uh , 
i enjoy , 
excuse me , go ahead . 
i grow a lot of things , a lot of food . 
and sometimes i want to plant something , there's not enough room to plant .
that's right . 
takes a lot of room . 
and it takes up your whole space .
it sure does . 
i made mistake one year and planted some cantaloupe , 
my goodness ,
they just run all over ,
they do . 
well , it was very good 
it just takes up , you know , like you say , a lot of your garden area . 
it's the first and only time i've done that . 
we don't do anything exotic 
we just do , oh , 
the basics . 
that's what we do too . 
my wife used to plant a few snow peas . 
i don't really care for snow peas . 
well , she just plants a few for herself . 
i got a few peas out my garden a couple of days ago . 
did you really ? 
the first one , they started them indoors this time . 
i read it , 
oh , i see . 
and so i , 
we don't start anything indoors 
uh , i guess you can get an earlier harvest by doing that , 
but , uh , sure is a heck of a lot of work . 
i guess it , 
because you got to ,
and i don't think i'll do it again .
 well it will make them taste better i'm sure . 
oh , yeah . 
i enjoy it . 
i come home from work 
and i usually say hello to wife and kids ,
you got to inspect it , 
and the kids want to swing , 
and i push them on swing . 
and i mow my own lawn . 
and i don't have a sprinkler system . 
i don't enjoy watering . 
this is the first home we've lived in we've had a sprinkler system , 
oh how , 
and boy , it is really nice , 
it sure beats dragging hoses around . 
you can have it come on just early in the morning .
that's right . 
that's right . 
it's really nice . 
i usually get it started for my wife 
 and she moves it around ever other day . 
i'll have to admit i do my own yard . 
i really don't enjoy doing that . 
i enjoy having a nice looking yard , 
i just don't enjoy the work ,
i had a lawn service to do my yard for me 
and now i've lost my excuse for that so i have to  , 
for the last couple of years i've done it myself . 
sometimes i wish i could get one of these , uh , chemical services to come ,
but , uh , they want too much money . 
it is kind of expensive , 
it is . 
of course , the chemicals themselves when you buy them , they're expensive too . 
but it's still be quite a bit cheaper to do it yourself . 
that's right . 
if i have a problem discipline , you know , i think , 
now , boy , i really need to get out , you know , and apply something , you know , 
and i screw around and don't do it or wait too long or something . 
and the weed come up , 
that's right . 
and all of a sudden you've got to do something else . 
that's right . 
i'm kind of bad about that . 
i enjoyed having a lawn service 
but now i have the time 
and you know , don't , 
 well , if you , 
that's right . 
i'm not limited to ,
i can do it on most any day of the week . 
when the days start getting a little longer ,
that's right . 
when they switch to , 
when we get an hour more , 
when they rollback an hour . 
that's coming up here pretty soon . 
is it this weekend ? 
i don't know . 
it's pretty soon . 
i really don't know . 
it just seems like i here it on the news the day before . 
and , uh , i think it's coming up here soon . 
 i believe it is too . 
are you having any trouble with bugs in your garden ? 
i seldom use anything harsher than seven dust , you know . 
i don't really like to put a lot chemicals on it 
but then ,
it seems like they come in spurts . 
one year i didn't put anything on 
and i didn't have any problems . 
next year i was planting some broccoli and some of those , they're called cabbage , 
they were just covered with them , 
i mean , i went up , 
i didn't go out there for about three days , you know , 
that's right . 
they devoured it that quickly . 
they really go through it , 
and , they , 
they really do . 
and they would , you know , 
i picked off like twenty of them 
you know cutworms will do the same thing to your tomato vines too . 
boy , they'll strip , 
they got that , uh , what is that safer soap , uh , 
and i've been watching them every day 
and i haven't seen any signs yet . 
so , if i see any signs i'm going to spray them , 
and , uh , 
i did something a little bit different this year that i haven't done before , 
i've got , 
my garden is shaped that i can , 
it's kind like this , uh , box shape , 
so i got four pieces of two by twelve and joined them together and just made a box .
and , you know , various other things ,
well , the good stuff . 
and i'm hoping especially with those big tall sides on there it that maybe oh , i'll have less of a bug problem 
they'll have a hard time crawling up the thing . 
my backyard uh , is sloping 
so i built a box up , you know 
and , uh , i had sandy loam hauled in . 
i had a dump truck come and dump it . 
on my driveway , i guess , that's what they do 
and then , 
but , uh , you know , you can improve your own soil there 
 but the texas soil isn't the greatest ,
that's right , 
you have to work on . 
and you know , if i didn't wait five years for it to be good enough grow 
you know what i mean .
that's right . 
when we had our pool done i had them to leave some extra loam , you know , for my garden 
so i had a lot of loam out there to start with 
i just turned it all up and mixed it all up together 
do you have a rotor tiller ? 
i did it by hand , 
small enough , 
you have a , 
just do it by hand ? 
it wasn't too much of a job ,
like i say it's just , 
i'd like to get one of these little small ones ,
it would be handy . 
and it weighs twenty pounds or ,
my neighbor across the street has one . 
he always uses it to dethatch his lawn , 
i see him out there , 
and i guess it has a thatcher attachment to it . 
it might be handy , 
they're pretty neat little , 
i've never seen one . 
i have a friend who has one 
and he lets me , you know , no problem borrowing if it's ,
oh , yeah . 
and it's a fairly large one to ,
that would be neat , 
that would be nice . 
we've had a garden , gosh , for years and years and years ,
i can't remember a year when we didn't have one of some kind . 
what have you got growing right now ? 
uh , got , 
you know tomatoes that are starting to bloom 
 and , uh , i mea , yes , i've got a few carrots up 
and i've got some radishes up , 
and as a matter of fact , i've already done a second row of radishes . 
and , uh , the green onions are coming along . 
what kind , 
excuse me . 
what kind of onions do you grow ? 
do you grow those ten , fifteen y ? 
oh , they are the best . 
we tried to find them last year , 
we screwed around and waited too long 
and i couldn't find a nursery that had any of them left . 
but we've got some this year . 
uh , those , 
snow peas are up 
and , uh , my wife does , uh , a small herb garden on the side . 
i see . 
they're up and doing fine . 
i , uh , 
those onions , i think , onions 
and they lasted from , you know , when you harvest them about a month from now or so ,
and , uh , we really missed them when they were gone ,
that's kind of a ,
she made these onion rings that were so good , 
oh , i bet , 
they were . 
that's right . 
we use a lot , 
we sure do . 
and it was just like everything you put it into tasted so much better . 
one nice thing with onions and bell peppers at least you can chop them and freeze them if you have ,
we froze a lot of peppers . 
we let some turn red . 
we did that too , 
and some we do green 
and then my wife puts them on pizzas .
oh , yeah . 
put them in salad , 
you're making me hungry here . 
we planted some yellow peppers this year . 
we've tried it ,
and nope , 
yellow peppers , huh . 
they have some little buds on them hopefully they'll do something . 
sounds like you have a real good garden . 
we enjoy fooling around with it . 
just let me see what i got , 
i got the peas 
and i've got some broccoli , uh , onions some radishes and , uh , uh , beets . 
beets . 
we've got some beets , 
uh , and i planted potatoes too . 
i've never done potato . 
we used to do it at home when i was a kid ,
oh , the potato , 
they're delicious 
but they , 
you don't seem to get that much for the space , 
they do . 
 yeah , it does take some space . 
some beet , uh , potatoes 
  and i've got some tomatoes still growing ,
i see . 
i got to wait for a place to free up . 
uh , our kids love pickles 
and we all love pickles 
so we're going to try to grow our own pickles this year . 
that will be neat , 
we've got some good , um , um , hybrid burpee uh 
and we're going to try to see if we can pickle our own 
that will be neat , 
they're expensive . 
i know it . 
i don't know unless it ,
i really ,
i guess . 
but we're going to try that ,
that will be interesting . 
an experiment . 
i'd like to you know , just try something new ,
that's interesting . 
well , i'll let you go it's , 
are you on an exercise program now 
i lift weights quite a bit . 
um , i run occasionally . 
let's see what else do i do . play golf some , 
and i work out on a hanging bag . 
i'm brown belt in karate , 
so i 
oh , yeah . 
how about you . 
um , the only exercise program i'm doing right now is walking . 
i've got a nine month old , 
and i'm four months pregnant with my second , 
and so , at the time , walking seems to be the best . 
it's something i can do with her , plus , um , doesn't tax me too physically . 
i have enjoyed aerobics in the past , 
and i enjoy that because i like the group association , you know , like exercising with other people . 
um , and that's my favorite way to exercise . 
well , that's neat . 
i do walk some too . 
my wife's about five months along 
 so she's been walking quite a bit , 
so that is a good exercise for that . 
it's nice to do it together , too , i guess . 
my husband and i use to walk together , 
but our schedules don't coincide as well as they used to , 
and so , we very seldom get together to walk 
but , when you work out , do you pretty much do it on your own schedule , 
or do you go to groups 
i do it on my own schedule . 
we used to try and belong to clubs or the y , stuff like that , 
but it was so difficult to go on a regular basis , to drive the distance you have to go . 
save the fees , 
we've , uh , just save the fees and buy some of our own equipment . 
and then you can do it whenever you want i guess . 
i've got a weight bench , 
and we got my wife an exercise bike , 
and i use that sometimes too . 
it's a little more convenient , 
but , i guess you're not as dedicated if you don't drive over to do it . 
i guess it depends on the person , depends on how motivated you are . 
because my husband used to work out three days a week uh , at the texas instruments gym . 
and then i would just go on saturdays . 
but , since the first of the year neither one of us have been going . 
so , i guess , like i say , we've been paying these fees and not going , 
so it's kind of a waste of money if you don't take advantage of it . 
i think you really have to be disciplined . 
uh , i try to work out at least a couple of times a week , 
and i think you really have to , at least twice a week , just to maintain the shape that you're in . 
with the walking , i think they said you need to walk at least twelve miles a week for it to be aerobically beneficial . 
and i have two friends , that we walk . 
they have babies that are about the same ages as mine , 
and we've been walking every morning going 
when it was cold we would go to the mall because you can't take the babies out 
so do about fifteen miles a week , 
but the last little while , for one reason or another , we haven't been real consistent . 
so it's a little harder when you're depending on other people to do it with you 
you know , i usually do it because i want to , because i know it's good for me , not because , i don't feel obligated to do it . 
i enjoy it . 
if i feel too obligated to do it , 
i start to rebel , 
and i won't be as consistent with it . 
i understand . 
did you exercise between your first child and your second ? 
and i started having pains . 
so i've calmed down everything except , i was working out doing aerobic exercises as well as the , um , walking , 
and i had to stop the aerobics because it was just kind of painful . 
but the t i rec center has an aerobics program for , um , prenatal and postnatal aerobic type thing . 
and i was going to wait until , um , about my sixth month and then start that . 
i did that with the second baby , 
and , um , i went to my exercise class one day , 
and then she was delivered the next day . 
so , it would seem to be real beneficial . 
maybe it speeded up the process and all that . 
and is this your first that you're having ? 
oh , okay , 
well , then i don't know how much you've been through it , 
but i think parts of it made a lot easier . 
and , i've talked to a lot of ladies that exercise with one pregnancy and didn't with the other , 
and they said that the one they had exercised with was three or four times easier . 
and i had , 
having both of them natural , the first one was natural and going natural the second , 
it's rough 
but it's not as bad as i thought it would be , 
and i think the exercise helped . 
well , that's good . 
so , do you work with t i ? 
my wife has been working with them . 
oh , okay , 
well then she could go if she were interested . 
i think , that's what the class that meets on saturday mornings . 
so she could find out if she wanted to go . 
 it's kind of fun because with the first pregnancy all the other ladies except one were on their first pregnancy , 
and they would talk about exercise and just general things relating to the birthing process . 
and so for us it was educational as well as exercise beneficial . 
at least its something you enjoy . 
but there's a lot of different things you can do that are enjoyable that you don't have to strain yourself or sweat 
that's right . 
but i guess that you don't want to overdo . 
well it's been good talking to you . 
been good talking to you as well . 
i hope your baby goes well 
yours too . 
well what do you think ? 
well , from one to ten what my no would be . 
it would probably be somewhere closer to , uh , less control because i don't see , 
i'm not a member of the n r a although my ,
but , i think the n r a has gone overboard the wrong way . you know , 
they're sitting there on number ten , 
and i think that's a dumb ,
because there has got to be some kind of background check to see ,
that's true . 
it's not a big deal for them to go . 
if they're can check your drivers license every time you get a ticket , you know , i mean , they should be able to go back and find out if you've had any kind of psychiatric record , 
that's true . 
any of that kind of stuff . 
and , it seems to me right now that there's not that much of a check . 
i'm not really sure what texas law , i think there's a check for   felonies , on your record . 
if the gun shop owner does it , 
 you know , but , 
but he has to go out and do it . 
that's true , i think , 
 and if it's a private sale , of course , then there's nothing . 
and , see that's my only problem with , uh , 
you know , get the check and everything is , i guess bad guys , if you want to call them bad guys , 
they are going to get a gun no matter what . 
they're not , 
i don't think they're going to go to a gun store or pawn shop and get it the right way when there's a check , 
i think they're going to go out and find it someway , individual sale or something like that . 
but maybe we'll prevent a few john hinckleys . 
i hope . 
that's true . 
 you know , i , 
that's the kind of people , 
like i say , i don't think the guy who's going to rob a seven eleven , is going to rob a seven eleven whether he has a gun or a knife , baseball bat , 
he's going to do what he wants to do . 
that's true . 
i just think it makes honest people more honest 
and the people who want it , it's not that big a deal , like i say , to wait . 
and , if you have to have it in a hurry , something's wrong .
it makes you wonder ,
 that's right . 
well , i'm married to a policeman , 
so we talk about this a lot .
his opinion is a little bit towards the one there , 
if i was a cop i would be , 
worried about that . 
too many people have too much access . 
they do . 
 and , i think , the other thing that we ought to control to some extent is , there should be some law against the types of gu , 
i mean , 
or um the little um toy guns look real . 
i mean 
that's really gotten bad 
i've heard so much about that on tv 
and that's kind of scary to think that you may be shot for holding one . 
or your child 
if your child is old enough , 
i mean , there are a lot of kids who when they're ten look like they're twelve ,
that's the truth . 
 and if some of them are doing something that they shouldn't be and then they have one of those toy guns in their hands 
and a cop comes up , 
i mean , you can't blame them . 
it looks 
you can't    , 
jeez and you can't take the chances . 
that's right , 
because there's been kids that age who have killed people . 
and , you know , you know , there was a law i think it's in oregon , where they've now made all toy guns , 
they're making them neon colors . 
and i think , that's a good idea . 
 you know like , yeah , 
and the kids don't care . 
that's right . 
my kid didn't care . 
i know . 
he picks up a stick and goes bang . 
it doesn't make any difference to him . 
a gun is a gun to them . 
they can play with anything and make it a gun . 
that's exactly right . 
so you like to do , 
i think they ought to do that with toy guns , 
they ought to make them very reasonably 
 you know , so that they're not very distinguishable from a real gun . 
that's right . 
that's a good idea . 
i was , uh , watching t v yesterday 
and there is a town in georgia , 
and it's the law that you have a gun , 
every adult , you know , uh , is able to carry a gun , 
that's kind of    , 
which really surprised me 
 i think , and that's what they were going after , uh , they went to interview this town , 
i mean it's a little dinky town , 
they went to interview them about the gun control laws 
you know , we're all honest , and everything like ,
we all carry them , 
but we don't mind being checked . 
uh , and i think it kind of took that uh , neatness away from it , you know , 
i don't know . 
that's kind of an odd thing . 
i don't know , 
i have a gun 
and , uh , my folks have always had . 
i learned to shoot when i was real little . 
i think that's a lot of it too , is that people need to teach their kids ,
because my dad started letting me shoot like a little air b b gun , 
but , you know , it was , 
this is how you hold 
and you don't ever touch it unless i'm here , 
that's what we're doing . 
and then they had , 
then they went to the texas parks and recreation , i guess , 
but anyway the hunter safety program ,
oh , yeah . 
i think it started in about nineteen seventy . 
if you want to go deer hunting 
and your birthday's after nineteen something ,
 well , that's neat . 
 or you can't get a deer license . 
well , that's real neat . 
it's basic stuff , 
and then you crawl over it ,
and , uh , 
well , that's real good . 
it is always incredible to me the number of times those kind of stupid accidents happen to people . 
and they usually are real basic ,
put the safety on the gun . 
always assume it's loaded . 
that's got to be the most common thing that people , 
i know 
and people don't want to believe that . 
oh , it's empty , 
it's empty . 
well see i , 
i took the clip out , or whatever 
and i forgot about the one in the chamber .
well we're trying to teach our daughter . 
she knows real well uh , about her daddy's guns ,
 oh , yeah . 
does he got them locked up all the time too ? 
when he's    , 
yeah , um , 
 and she's real , 
um , she'll know , 
don't even think about it , 
so , she's real good about it . 
and , she's never been curious , 
i mean , cause he's always , you know , 
if he has them out , cleaning them , you know , she can be there 
and he'll tell how he's doing it or , you know , show her the insides or stuff like that . 
if you make it where it's not something ,
to be feared 
not something to be curious about and not something to be totally scared about . 
if it's just one more piece of something , 
but they've got to understand , like you said , never touch it . 
they'd have that respect for what it does , 
ours is a , 
we have a shotgun , 
and it's up in the closet , 
and then the shells are in another part 
and it's something to think about , 
and i got it because my husband used to travel , and be out , 
he was out of the country at one time for three months . 
oh , yeah . 
but still , 
still .
and then i've got it so far , 
sometimes you know , i assume that the kids are not going to ever get up there , 
and it's in a case , 
and you know , it's put up 
and it's away and all that , 
but , i don't want to take the chance 
and , i think , if somebody ever does break in ,
he's got to go to a lot of trouble . 
hold on , 
hold on  , 
he's in here somewhere , 
i know he is . 
well , i know how to use one . 
we go hunting every once in a while 
and he showed me how to use his guns 
and i really enjoy it 
but , boy if someone did break in , i don't know that i could or would even grab it .
i know , 
i used to think about that , 
it was a lot easier when i was single , 
it was one thing 
and when i was just married with no kids ,
that's true . 
and now there's so many other things , where are the kids , what are they doing ,
uh , you've got , 
if you manage to get it out 
and then , you know , what you're going to do because you don't know where your kids are ,
well we have dogs 
we feel if they make enough noise that , 
if they're stupid enough to come through then .
we have two big dogs in the backyard ,
they've got to be pretty stupid , 
and most people that , uh , break in or whatever , go to houses without the dogs ,
anything , that the , 
well any advantage that they can take . 
and , that's one of them 
guess it makes it worth the dog food over the years .
really does . 
well , do you think we've , 
i think that's about all i can , 
me too , on gun control . 
we're in pretty good agreement actually on it . 
i think we are . 
you to be some of these people who are at the other end of the spectrum . 
i'm glad you're not .
me too . 
i'm glad to find there's another reasonable person in garland . 
well good! 
well , it's been nice talking to you . 
you too , 
what kind of lawn and garden work do you do ? .
 so i've been trying to rebuild and reestablish the entire lawn , 
and after three years of working at it , i've been amazed at just what a little bit of doing help out things to the lawn has really brought it back . 
instead of mowing in the same direction every time , changing , cut the lawn the long way , then you'll go the opposite way , instead of going lengthways , you go width , 
and it helps the grass come back . 
 oh , does it really ? 
i didn't know that .
 um , you've been working on it for three years ? 
what have you done ? .
killing lots of fire ants . 
i was firmly convinced the entire ,
because it was like , you couldn't even stand still out there . 
it was like you'd go out in the yard to water something , you'd just be standing still . 
and the ants would start crawling up your legs . 
it's like , i'm not standing in a mound , though . 
oh , wow . 
how did you get rid of them ? 
uh , dursban two . 
a chemical called dursban two , 
it's a crystal . 
dursban will get rid of just about anything , i think . 
 um , so you haven't had a problem with that , since ? 
um , not bad . 
but that's , to be expected . 
did it kill anything else it wasn't supposed to ? 
not really . 
even the area of the grass that was underneath and around the mounds 
well , that's pretty wild . 
we used it for fleas . 
we had fleas in our yard real bad last year , 
and we did that um , 
i'm not , 
basically , i like to mow the lawn , believe it or not , 
but i sometimes have problems starting the mower , 
so a lot of times i won't get out and do it , 
but my husband , basically , does most of it , 
and he does the , you know , edging and all that kind of thing , 
and we're renting , 
and so we don't really put a lot of money into the , uh , you know , like 
this lawn could probably stand a couple of loads of dirt , and some saint augustine . 
we have winter rye out back , 
and we have , 
i don't even know what it is out front , 
 but , um , this is the first house we've ever lived in , 
and we're just not real into the lawn probably because we're renting , i guess , huh ? 
so , it , anyway , 
you said you had problems with fleas last year in the yard ? 
we were getting , 
uh , i found one thing that , it's kind of a weird thing to say to put out on the lawn , 
powdered sulphur . 
oh , really ? 
hm , i wonder why it does ? 
you don't have to put a whole lot out , 
just if you've got a broadcast spreader 
and it's real fine , like flour 
 and you just 
and i mean , you don't have to put clumps of it , 
just very lightly cover the entire yard . 
well , i'll have to remember that , because hopefully we won't have them this year , 
but we have a cat that comes in and out , 
and the cat was getting , um , fleas and stuff and bringing them in the house , 
so we had a real problem last year with fleas , 
and uh , we got them in our house , 
and we're christians , 
and we prayed that we could get rid of these fleas , 
and we got rid of them , believe it or not , with smoke bombs , which is just about impossible to do , 
but we did , 
and so we don't want them back this year , you know ? 
 so i'll remember that if we see it's a problem in the yard . 
we're almost , 
 they were so bad last year , even ticks . 
i don't know , 
we've had ticks before a lot , 
and we've had to get out and treat our lawn for that . 
we used dursban and diazinon and get out there and do what you do with that thing , you know , and spread it all out everywhere , 
but that's about the extent of our lawn care . 
so , i don't know , 
do you enjoy doing it ? 
my wife can't understand 
it'd be a hundred degrees outside , i'll be out there . 
but it's too hot to be working in the yard . 
i'm under the trees , 
i'm having fun , 
and i'm stopping to drink water , 
so what's the problem ? .
well that's funny . 
not everybody enjoys it , though . 
everybody has a different thing . 
i kind of enjoy it 
and my husband doesn't .
i kind of have to , 
sometimes i'm too busy to get out there and do it , 
and you know , he doesn't really enjoy doing it , 
but he'll do it , 
and he doesn't gripe about it or anything , 
but , you know , i'm kind of like you 
and he's kind of like your wife . 
i mean , you know , in that he doesn't really enjoy it , 
but i would like to have a garden , you know , 
that's my thing , 
but right now where we're living we have the trees where their , uh , roots are at the top of the ground everywhere over the ground . 
i don't know what kind of trees they are , 
but you can't have a garden , 
you can't till it , 
or it'll tear up a nice tiller .
so we're going to wait until we move . 
we don't have a lot of sun , either , because it's big trees back there . 
so we're going to wait , 
and when we move that's one of our priorities , is to get a house where we can have a , uh , garden . 
and so i'd like to do that . 
i have a feeling i'll be out there all the time taking care of that , 
but that's our next thing .
do you have a garden ? 
i've got , the , 
this is the neat thing about the place we ended up at .
and half of it's , 
 oh , are you kidding ? 
that sounds fun . 
where do you all live ? 
uh , in missouri city . 
oh , really , 
southwest side of houston . 
southwest where ? 
southwest houston . 
oh , really ? 
oh , because we're in dallas . 
i guess i assumed you were here . 
well , that's neat . 
and , um , yeah 
that's what we want . 
we have a , 
but we just haven't been able to do that yet , 
so one day we'll be able to do it , 
and i'm excited about it . 
and then i don't know anything about it , 
i have to learn , 
and then you'll have to give me a call on gardening .
what do you do in your garden , 
and i'll go nothing , 
what should i do ? 
but anyway , i guess that's about it though . 
it sounds like we've covered all the bases 
so i guess we'll let you go , 
and , um , do you have anything else you wanted to say ? 
uh , no , 
it's just ,
i know , you too . 
i hope you have a nice day , 
you too . 
okay . 
well , uh , do you believe only fifty percent of the people actually vote ? 
i think it's somewhere really close to that cause i think a lot of people believe that their one little vote is not going to make that much difference . 
and they really don't listen to any of the issues anymore . 
because they feel like so many of the politicians are like crooked , you know ? 
they're going to do what they want to do . 
they're corrupt anyway .
and i think it does . 
we vote every time . 
 well , uh , there's no question it does make a difference . 
uh , so far ,
because people have to vote in different areas 
and , uh , not everyone votes at the same place . 
uh , i , personally , think that we need to do more along the education lines in the schools and the children from the little ones on up , with the idea of the value of voting and the purpose of voting and that one vote does make a difference . 
and maybe let them have some mock , i mean 
that's a real good idea . 
are doing that in a number of schools .
but it's going to take at least a whole generation of people , uh , to get across the idea of voting . 
uh , just like it's taking a whole generation of people to finally , uh , realize the harmfulness of drugs and 
how to say no to it and what have you . 
uh , perhaps we'll finally get the youth weaned off of it . 
but , uh , i know i , 
and in nineteen fiftyone the police were telling us about the drug dealers outside the school and how they were just giving away their marijuana , giving away their heroin and what have you , to get them started . 
and , you know , that was in fiftyone . 
that's forty years ago 
so it's now , uh , to the forefront 
and people are finally taking some action against it . 
and the thing , 
and we also don't make uh , the issues perhaps in language that people fully understand them . 
well i don't know how it is up there 
but down here , louisiana has a bad reputation for their politicians and all . 
i mean , i'm sure you heard about 
and , uh , people are just , 
i mean it's like they're turned off on voting . 
and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party . 
we're going to have a block party . 
everybody's going to get together . 
we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff 
and then we're going to go and vote , you know . 
we're going to go vote 
like , maybe they could give something like , uh , the top neighborhood , if you had a hundred percent in your neighborhood or something like that , you know . 
i mean a sign that they would put down at the end of your block .
but it's really bad here . 
i mean to me it is . 
it seems like people just don't care anymore . 
one crook is as good as the other one . 
and they don't bother to listen to what any of them have to say . 
and , uh , i know my husband now we go vote every time . 
i don't care how small the ballot is , i 
because the way i feel is if i don't vote , then i don't have any reason ,
right . 
you know , but they didn't go vote . 
that's right . 
and , uh , like you said , if they would start when little kids and start letting them vote and learn how to vote 
that's right . 
he needs your vote just like he needs everybody else's , you know . 
maybe if they were brought up that a way , like you said , it would . 
because i know here , uh , until you get into high school now then they had the voting machines 
and you voted for like cheerleaders 
but they should start that a lot earlier . 
it's the same way with everything in education though . 
it should begin right down in the first grade . 
uh , and your very best teachers in my estimation should be first , second or third grade . so that the children develop good learning patterns 
and you have some success and want to go on learning and continue learning , uh 
and then it's too late to try to change them around at that point . 
but , uh , everything should be started on the lower levels 
and , uh , certainly if the youngsters had that opportunity that , you know , they understood that the principles of the country were established so that everyone would have a say and everyone would have a vote and what that vote meant 
and perhaps it's because our campaigns have become so terribly expensive to run , uh , that only the most wealthy can do so . 
and they're not always the best person for the job . 
 right  .
but they have the money to be able to do it . 
and perhaps the government , 
 you know a good a mock one . 
and , okay , this candidate tells 
and this candidate tells you 
okay , then this percentage of the voters , i mean the kids in that class , they are not going to let them vote this time 
but they have to do whatever these people , whichever one the other people 
if they did something like that and started kids out real young and showed them , okay now you're not going to get to vote 
but you're 
they would understand probably by the time they were 
they'd be ready to vote . 
that's right . 
 and i think , you know , that's an excellent idea . 
they would put them to realize that they're going to have to do what someone else says even though they didn't vote for it .
now some 
uh , and i don't know that , uh , a lot of people vote in primaries for that very reason . 
uh , they can declare anything they want 
and they can actually  rig it  .
if they really wanted to vote republican , they could go in the primary and say they were voting democrat and then stack the ballot for someone that perhaps the republican could beat . 
but , uh , uh , it's just a sad situation 
and , uh , i do think more needs to be done along that line to help to , uh , teach the uh , uh , everyone , uh , more about what is going on with voting and with nonvoting .
and it's going to take these young 
i think that sounds great . 
 you know , it's going to take uh , a whole generation of my feeling , uh , before that's going to be accomplished .
well , you know , they'd have to start when they're real young . 
that's right . 
i mean , you know , it would have to be a child that is just coming into school . 
because , well i'll tell you another thing too now . 
the first time i voted , i never voted in high school because there was never anyone that showed us how to use the 
now this sounds dumb , 
but i did not know how to use those voting machines 
and nobody ever showed us or anything 
so i didn't vote because anybody that went in there and they asked a question , all the other kids 
they thought that was funny . 
 ah , she don't even know how ,  wah , wah  .
so there wasn't any way i was going to go in there and vote . 
and i mean it took such courage you wouldn't believe 
sure it is . 
now that's bad . 
and i mean i was out of school . 
i was a married person . 
and , uh , i didn't know how to work the machine , you know . 
and it really scared me , really bad . 
because i thought all these people are going to laugh at me because i don't know how to work this machine . 
 well , just the opportunity to try the voting machines , 
this is the way it's going to be . 
and my son was exactly the same way that i was 
and i didn't realize it until , uh , his senior year . 
well then i realized it 
he'll have to come back out . 
uh , so he went in 
and now he's a 
but he would not vote 
and , i mean , i think that's bad . 
sure it is . 
 you know , here i was . 
 and even , of course there's a lot of years between the two of us , 
but even with that many years between  , 
what kind of car are you thinking about buying next ? 
well , what do we currently have , 
i have a subaru , uh , g o x t . 
what year ? 
oh , okay . 
well , i have a ninety honda civic , 
and i'm ready to get rid of it .
 oh , it's not  pretty old . 
uh , well , i had an eightyeight that i really liked 
and it got wrecked , 
and so i bought a ninety , um , because i really liked my eightyeight 
and i've had a lot of problems with this one , 
so , you think their quality control's going down over there ,  kind of   ? 
well , you , 
it's kind of funny , um , 
i know a lot , 
well , i think we're going to see that i think , uh , that the quality that the japan carmakers had is slipping a little bit ,
it's true , 
but that's one reason 
uh , i've had no problems with my subaru , 
that's one reason i went with it because subaru had a good reputation , uh , for , you know , low maintenance , 
well , honda does too  , that's why i was really , 
well , really , 
there's no question 
but you have a nineteen , 
i mean ,  i've got to see if   , 
i mean , i've seen and i've had friends that have , uh , like , uh , eightyone or eighty , uh , celicas , 
and those things just keep ticking . 
i mean , a hundred fifty k on them , 
that's true . 
and they're still beating on them , 
that's true . 
and it's just amazing 
and then they got , 
and you know they're not making them like that now , you know , 
not at all . 
but they're still a lot , i think , definitely better than the american carmaker  system  .
oh , i definitely agree with you there ,  , because i had , uh , uh , uh , ford t bird before i got my honda , 
and it was the worst car i've ever owned  , 
and , um , that's why , i mean , i was so tickled with my honda 
it was just a wonderful car 
and then it got wrecked 
and , you know , i wouldn't even look at another car  , 
i just went and bought a honda , i mean , i didn't look around or anything i just said that this is what i want ,  , 
and i really have had a lot of problems with it , 
but i don't know . 
well , maybe you need to unload it on somebody el , .
 well , i'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty 
but in the first twelve months that i owned it , it was in the shop an average of about once a month ,  , 
it was in the shop about twelve times the first twelve months .
that's a lot . 
it was , 
i was really disappointed because i was , you know , so , hyped up on honda , 
oh , well . 
so , what's your next purchase supposed to be ? 
well , i know this , 
 oh , really   , 
if you had a choice of your car , what would you get ? 
i really like those 
and i have kids , 
i'm not sure i'm real familiar with the body style on that . 
they're a lot , 
i don't like the new style , like of the toyota van ,
i don't like those styles , um , the m p v is more of , uh , uh , just , uh , i don't know what you , normal ,  , 
i don't know how to explain , more of an old fashioned type . 
i'm not sure how to explain it , 
i mean it looks , i guess , kind of like , uh , the chevy aerostar or arrow , 
astro , i guess ,
 oh , okay , 
yeah  .
but i used to really like the looks of the m p v because it looks more like a mini van rather than i think , 
uh , do you have a family ? 
well , that's probably influenced maybe  a little bit  .
oh , yeah ,  , 
but , i know that it's got to have a radio , it's got to have air conditioning ,  , 
i'm sure you can , uh , relate to air conditioning .
oh , yeah . 
but , and cruise control and tinted windows , that's about it , .
i mean , it's got to have those things , otherwise , i don't care . 
well , when i bought my car , it was right out of college 
and , uh , you know ,  i always been  looking for something sporty 
and i ended up getting , you know , basically something that i could , you know , afford . 
the only gripe i have is performance . 
i probably , uh , 
a few girls that i've gone out with , i've had , uh , like mazda r x sevens and stuff 
and they're pretty fun to drive , 
oh , really ? 
and then i could upgrade now if i wanted to 
but i , 
it's just such a huge expense 
i'm just going to keep holding off 
but  i'm  definitely going to look for something , uh , in the , you know , nice , perpor ,
sports car .
i'd like to have a sports car too , 
but it's not practical for me , 
i'm in , 
this is , 
i don't know , 
it just depends , 
i know that's what i want , 
but i don't know if i'll get myself to spend that kind of money , 
you're looking you know , for a new r x seven or , a supra or something , 
you're looking at twentyfive k or something ,
oh , at least , 
and so , 
i know ,
maybe someday .
that's the only one that i , you know , 
i hope it's not my    , 
 , you there ? 
it may be my phone , um , 
you're right .
uh , kind of what i'm , 
but it's , 
at the other one my brother's got a miata 
and those are fun . 
oh , those are nice , 
and , uh , 
they're cute cars .
well , a red miata , 
and , uh , he actually , 
they came out with a european racing , green , uh , miata that's a limited edition , 
they're only going to make like three or four thousand . 
so , he went out 
and he traded the other one in and got this one , 
wow , i haven't seen those . 
 and i'm like , um   , but , uh , i haven't seen one  yet  either 
but supposedly they have some real wood built in to like the clutch and all this and the steering wheel , 
so , it's very authentic 
and there only is supposed to be limited edition so it may be a good investment . 
if it , 
oh , yeah , 
no matter what it is , if it's a limited edition , it's usually worth something later on . 
but , uh , i think 
i got off my pace or my cordless phone ,
it's going to  bump  me out . 
um , but he only spent , you know , the low twentys 
now , see , i would have figured that to be a lot more than that for something that's limited edition . 
well , i don't know , 
i think the demand's gone all , down a little bit . 
i think you can , 
the prices aren't as high , you know , 
and miata was first introduced , uh , 
and you get your options ,
that's true . 
but there were , you know , people were buying them for nineteen and twenty , 
and , um , 
but i , 
they're still pretty much in demand . 
i think there's another car coming in , 
it's supposed to come out and compete with that miata , 
and i can't remember what i read about that 
but so , that's    , 
i mean , i would think somebody would try to compete with that because it is very popular , 
it really is . 
have you seen the new , uh , dodge stealth ?
oh , yeah . 
the mitsubishi is real nice looking too , 
well , that's , 
now those are nice .
but , uh , yeah , 
and those are supposed to be very performance power , i mean , they're , 
the expensive ones ,
but those are pretty stripped , 
and there's nothing , 
there's really , 
that one's just more for looks , you know , 
it doesn't have really the performance that the expensive one does . 
you know , but i've seen one of those , 
and it's not that great , i mean , because they really , 
i think they're only around , uh , twentynine k . 
like , i mean they have , um ,  better   , 
it's not quite as nice for a little bit less . 
yeah , 
they're not really that bad 
but i don't know , 
like i said it's still not practical for me .
i'm being single 
and no other responsibilities for yourself , i guess , you know , it's , i can ,
i've , haven't tried to upgrade myself right now , 
that's , uh , you know , i could have , you know , get something nice and upgrade 
but uh , i'm consulting right now , 
oh , really ? 
i just made my first job  hop  about eight months ago , 
uh  . . . 
what do you think about the , uh , peace corps or public service commitment ? 
uh , that's the first i've ever heard of it . 
i haven't heard anything too much about it . 
well , i think it was , uh , thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft 
and people said , well , uh , young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country , 
but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from , um , some sort of public service ,
and it seems to me that it's not a totally bad idea , 
but i don't quite see how they'd make it work . 
how would they decide who goes into , uh , building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia ? 
my first impression was , um , it would be very good . 
i think it would be good for people to serve , 
but i don't know if it should be an option . 
it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids . 
and i think there are some available now where they are able to work , 
but making it a mandatory thing kind of , 
the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary . 
and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary , that it should be like a draft . 
and some people would get military service 
and some people would get civilian , uh , 
i assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do ,
they were allowed to do hospital service or , uh , things like that , 
and if they re , 
or farm work in world war one i remember 
 and i suppose that there is , uh , justification for taking everybody if you take anybody . 
but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them , uh , sorting them out , assigning them ,
it seems like you'd have a lot more conscientious objectors if they had that choice . 
well it's a possibility . 
you know , than to go war 
and i'm sure most young men and women would . 
and so , uh , 
well , i think that like that , uh , they had to be , uh , pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth ,
it was , uh , something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life . 
well , that makes sense . 
and then you run into , again , um , the bureaucracy in running it . 
you know , how you going to 
oh , yeah . 
and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend ,
plus the training involved . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah , 
that would be expensive in most cases . 
 because   , 
now i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps , uh , back in the mid sixties 
 and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization , 
but on the other hand , i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was . 
i don't ,
we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to , uh , what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh ,
but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went ,
well , i know in , 
i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan . 
and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me . 
it taught me not to be so selfcentered and you know , to think of others . 
but i don't know if i was doing it in different situation , you know , not a really religious background , if i would get a lot out of it . 
you know , i think i did because you know , it emphasized that sort of thing . 
you know , a lot of 
and it was definitely voluntary , too . 
they were not drafting you and sending you ,
and i'm sure that would make a big difference , too . 
you know ,  you've got   , 
well , what about a voluntary program ? 
do you think that would be a good idea ? 
um , well , like i say , i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for um , clean up and that sort of thing . 
but i don't know what organization it's under . 
i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private 
i don't either . 
but i know that that helps a lot with training and , um 
out here in california ,
and they don't have to be locked up go to these , uh , camps . 
and they ,
they maintain trails 
and they , uh , put up signs 
and they do fire prevention work and  certainly  things of that sort . 
and that i know is run by the state , 
but there may be other things . 
i'm not so sure what kind of , uh , training that is for the future for those kids . 
how much benefit ,
it's probably a , 
but whether it's something that they can put to economic use later on is a different subject . 
especially a middle of a park , 
if they go back to the inner city , they may not see trees for a while ,
that's true .
good point  , oh . 
may not benefit them in the long run . 
i'm sorry , 
i'm going to have to go , 
but my other line is blinking . 
well , thank you . 
but it was good to talk to you . 
you , too , 
okay . 
what's your most recent one that you've seen ? 
well actually , what i do , 
 so i haven't really seen any movies in the movie theater 
but i rent probably four or five movies a week . 
i used to do that too , 
but i haven't been doing it lately 
we've got a good video place out here 
and , uh , uh , oh gosh , uh , i'm just trying to think of all the movies i've recently seen . uh , 
oh , air america . 
have you seen wild orchid ? 
is it good ? 
well , it depends , 
do you like , uh , steamy movies .
uh , no , 
not ye , 
but usually i don't .
oh , okay , 
what type of movies do you like ? 
um , action .
bu , d , 
 well two of my favorite movies is probably like lethal weapon and lethal weapon two . 
and those are like two of my most favorite , 
i mean they're just really good movies . 
and i liked bird on a wire .
do you like suspense movies 
or do you like , uh , just action 
um , yeah , 
some , i guess like , 
what do you mean 
like are you talking about movies like die hard two . 
 oh , jagged edge , 
i liked that , 
that was pretty good . 
um , that was okay , 
i guess i thought it was too far fetched 
but i guess , 
oh , well i hope i don't run across them . 
that's true because , 
i don't know , 
i just didn't find that one to be real , 
i just thought it was too far fetched . 
what was your favorite all time movie ? 
um , oh gosh , i can't think off my head . 
do you know which one yours was ? 
i have to say that probably the one movie that really threw me back the most , uh , that i was really the most in shock with was probably , uh , star wars . 
oh , yeah , 
well that's , 
when that first came out , i really did not expect the special effects or anything like that . 
 i mean , i guess , uh , out of all the movies , i've never been as excited to go back . 
i was ready to go back and see it again , you know 
you're right about that , 
but that's really like an all time classic . 
i mean , i don't think anybody , anything could ever beat that . 
now , i also liked , uh , oh , gone with the wind or some of the classic , like the lawrence of arabia 
see , i've never seen that . 
oh , you haven't ? 
should i rent it ? 
oh , yeah . 
should i go rent it tomorrow .
and it's got a good historical perspective to it . 
that's probably something i need to see right now because i'm taking history in school .
oh , yeah . 
 actually , i just saw a movie , uh , called the lost capone . 
and it's about al capone's brothers .
oh , really . 
and i won't give the whole plot away 
but it's really a good movie . uh , 
al capone had three brothers , 
 and one of them was lost for many , many years 
and , uh , he turns out to be a law man . 
oh , you just gave it away , 
i guess i can't go see it  , 
that's okay , 
i didn't give away the whole thing , 
i just gave away just enough to get you interested .
that does sound good , 
is it one , 
i guess it's a rental . 
i may have to do that . go see it , 
or go rent it . 
and , a lot of times , what i wind up doing is , picking say an actor or an actress ,
i've seen all of james dean's movies .
and , just kind of go out and , uh , rent all the movies and , uh , uh , you know , just kind of go , 
i guess you could do that , you know , get all of david carradine's movies ,
what's his first name . 
i can't remember his first name . 
is it david segal . 
i don't know , 
he was uh , on , uh , uh , arsenio , just recently . 
oh , i don't watch that .
it was really kind of interesting because ,
god , i can't even remember the name . 
he said well , he wouldn't really talk about it . 
didn't want to talk about him because he didn't think he was such uh , a good action guy . 
it wasn't stallone , 
it was , uh , 
i can't remember . 
shoot , i can't remember the guy's name . 
but i like all the rambo movies . 
oh , see , that's one side of the action i guess that i didn't really care for 
but see i don't really like sylvester stallone . 
i don't think he's really a very good actor . 
i know that sounds awful because so many people think he's so wonderful 
but i just have never been a stallone fan . 
yo , adrian .
hey that's pretty good . 
i guess like i say , 
i don't know , i just have never seen any interest in him , 
good combination of movies with the exception of horror films . 
don't watch really very many horror films at all . 
i don't either .
you know , i don't know , 
there's something about people coming up through the sofa to get you , or something , you know , 
you're right . 
well it's so , 
 you know , i mean , i just 
and so many of them are done so poorly , 
you know it just doesn't even give you the effect , 
i mean some of them are done good 
and they do scare you . 
but , um , so many of them are just done real , 
i don't know , 
i'm not really into those . 
i just saw , uh , uh , a really interesting movie called , uh , flatliners . 
oh , that was one of my favorites , 
i thought that was a very good movie . 
i was really impressed with that one . 
i mean what i liked about it was that it was a new subject . 
nobody had ever touched it before . 
you know , and it was done so well , you know , 
it was just , 
it was just crazy enough for th , 
you know students might try to do it . 
you know , i mean , and it's not like there's a lot of scientific data on it . 
well that's probably true .
but it was a very good movie . 
it was done real well too . 
it seemed real , 
you know it was really good . 
that was one , i mean 
it's not my all time favorite movie 
but it was good , 
and , um , i don't know if you like this kind , 
but i thought pretty woman was a really good movie , too . 
oh , yeah , 
that was a great movie . 
we've seen that two or three times . 
we waited 
and we rented it , 
 you know , but it was really good . 
uh , have you seen shrimp on the  barby   ? 
i don't know if i've even heard of that one . 
it's got , 
it must have , uh , what's his name in it . 
it doesn't , 
uh , hogan ? 
i'm surprised . 
oh really , that must be pretty good then , 
was it good . 
it's uh , kind of a poor man's pretty woman in reverse . 
but it was kind of cute . 
actually did you see dirty rotten scoundrels ? 
i though that was a really cute movie , 
i enjoyed that . 
it was . 
twins was good too , 
because when i thought of that , i thought of , 
um , oh , there was another one , 
what's the one that just , 
oh , dances with wolves , have you seen that yet ? 
oh , you've got to see that one , 
it's really , 
i hear that's the one that you really need to see at the theater instead of home video .
that's probably true , 
it's very , very good . very good . 
that's another one that , 
i was really glad when it won all those awards because it really deserved it . 
well my wife , uh , has got uh , a picture from kevin costner 
and he signed it . 
it's from dances with wolves . 
her business associates .
oh , wow , that's impressive . 
 oh , neat . 
 so , uh , uh , but anyhow uh , we got a nice , uh , picture 
and it came in an envelope that says dances with wolves 
so we've got to , uh , try to get out there and see that one . 
oh , yeah , 
it's really worth it . 
i mean it's a very good movie 
and yes , 
i would suggest seeing it at the theater . 
i know that they're still playing it 
and they pushed it back , to playing it in the theaters until like august , 
i , think because they were scheduling a video release of it in july 
and then when it won all those awards , uh , they pushed it back to august , 
 so . but , yeah , 
that one is definitely worth seeing , 
it's really good . 
now did you see , uh , driving miss daisy ? 
you know , i guess it was okay , 
i mean it was all right , 
but , um , when i compare like the winners of this year and last year , it just , 
i don't know . 
maybe , it's not , 
well , um , i'm , uh , pretty pro gun control over all . 
uh , i've had a lot of arguments with people about the issue of gun control 
and , uh , i must say that there are a couple of arguments against , uh , strong gun control which i find very compelling , although most the people who argue gun control with me i find , uh , use sort of canned arguments , you know , sort of the n r a slogan arguments 
and , um , uh , see i've been very frustrated when i do debate with people about it . um , 
i guess on a scale of one of ten i'm probably around a two in terms of fair restricting guns 
and i have to admit most of that is , uh , strong personal distaste . 
i don't like the idea of people being able to kill me with very little effort . um , 
and , uh , guns are very symbolic of them having that power over me . 
well , me being from texas  , 
i hope you're ready for this . 
i've got my texan stereotypes in place . 
well , i'm not your stereotypical texan . 
i was raised around guns , hunting . 
 so i don't have a fear of fire arms in any respect . 
i respect them and what their capabilities are . 
and on top of that spending a good portion of my earlier years in the military , as a green beret , i definitely respect the power of weaponry . 
and here in houston , as well as just about any big city anywhere across this country , 
and here you go , 
here you , 
this will be border line n r a which i am not a member of . 
when the slogan , um , if you outlaw guns then only out laws will have guns . 
  a gun . 
well , you've got , 
well , any of the big cities you've got the different rival gangs 
and they're having their little turf wars over their little drug kingdoms and such , 
and they get out their little mac tens , 
they get out their little uzis 
and they're going to fight with them . 
and it doesn't matter what restrictions you put on that type of weapon or a class three firearm . 
if they want it they'll get it . 
i don't care if they've got to go down into new mexico to get it 
they'll get it 
and they'll get across the border . 
now my position , although , i have absolutely no use for a fully automatic weapon ,
since i am a lawabiding citizen and i have never had a felony , if i wanted to buy one , i don't think there should be that big of a restriction on it . 
if they want to run a background check on me , fine . 
if they want to put a seven day waiting period , fine , again . 
if they want me to present a letter from my county sheriff saying that i've got his permission to have an automatic weapon in his county , that's fine too . 
what i don't gets dangerous in terms of civil liberties because pretty soon it wouldn't , 
you don't want to have someone making a personal trust in that way , i would hope . i mean , because i mean someone 
the personal sheriff doesn't get to have a gun 
and someone the personal sheriff , 
is he a habitual trouble maker ? 
are we picking him up every saturday ,
and if he had an automatic weapon could he really be raising some problems . 
you know , just proving that you're a basically a good citizen . 
but if you're not a basically good citizen , 
you just told me that you're going to get one of those guns anyway . 
if they want the firepower they can get it . 
so why hav , 
because it doesn't matter how restrictive your border control points are 
they'll get it across the border one way or the other . 
so why have any restrictions at all ? 
uh , okay . 
go back to that one to ten scale where one ,
i'd said about an eight . 
well , we could be , 
i said the restrictions i would like to see for anybody , whether it being for handgun , a rifle , a shotgun , 
i would like to see them go through either , 
i'd like to see a law enforcement agency , not n r a , 
but whether it be your state police or your county police for you to be able purchase a handgun . 
you got to go through their course and get certified that you know how to properly handle the weapon , how to safely handle the weapon , how to properly maintain it , the three basics . 
well , that makes a lot of since to me . 
i mean , i certainly feel that if , we may disagree on when someone should own a fire arm 
but , uh , i certainly agree that if someone owns a fire arm that have as much responsibility to know how do , use it safely as someone learns how to drive , if not more so . 
well , the han , 
in the hands of the wrong person the car can be just as deadly as the weapon ,
well , i have a bicycle 
and that scares me too to tell you the truth because i've been run off the road and all sorts of things . 
well , i'm still puzzled though , what is the argument , 
how does the argument work uh , if the bad guys are going to have guns anyway . 
what's the point of putting a restrictio , 
basically , the restrictions are just to penalize the good guys because the bad guys are going to get the guns anyway 
they're not going to take those courses . 
uh , is it a way of raising the prices of illegal guns ? 
well there's , 
if it's not going to cut the supply of illegal guns it must going to at least raise the prices 
does that , uh , mean advantage ? 
what is happening at least in this state 
and i expect to see it in other states very soon , 
legislation been introduced that , if a citizen of the state , being ,
l a area ? 
uh , no . 
san francisco ,
you've been to the city ? 
and all these people come around , 
someone attempts to mug me i would ju , 
i would , 
as it stands now if he pulls a blade on me we're equally matched because i can meet him blade for blade . 
now if this legislation comes through , 
he pull , 
i'm out with my family 
we've gone shopping , 
we're fixing to get in the car , 
this guy comes up , 
he pulls a blade on me . 
i can pull a gun on him now . 
and when you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon things change real quick . 
what if you're looking down the barrel of a hand cannon ? 
then it's still equally matched . 
if i'm ,
i'm sure , 
i'm sure given all , 
if i walk into a bad neighborhood i'm sure i'd want to walk through with you because i'm sure you have far above the average instinct for how to use guns and how to use them effectively and everything . 
um , i'm , quite concerned that if you let everyone 
hasn't yet committed a felony , 
if you let them all walk around carrying guns 
in this sort of wild west scenario , you're going to get an awful lot of people shooting guns pretty quickly just given human nature . 
you're going to start getting a lot of gunfire . 
a situation of , you know , 
take it to a logical extreme , 
if everyone walking around carrying a guns you're not going to have an increase in gunfire . 
actually it's no , 
it's more of a police action in itself , 
but hey , he's carrying just as much firepower as i can . 
and if they're sca , if you got to go through a certification course to get to where you can carry it in public ,
now whether this person is made the moral decision whether he can take another human life or not ,
in defense of myself , defense of my family or defense of my friends i can blow somebody a way in a heart beat .
i know , 
i understand that . 
uh , what if you think someone's trying to hurt them and you make a mistake ? 
this is where the question of gun control comes in . 
say a person , uh , uh , get , 
all of a sudden my combat in me goes up 
and say i've got the vibes , this guy's fixing to do something , 
i go ahead and pull my piece . 
and i make sure this persons sees it so that he's got now doubt that i will use it on him 
and i will use it right then . 
as it stands now i've got to do that with a blade . 
and the only reason i feel comfortable doing that is because of the training i've had . 
well would possibly be in the role of an independent bystander , i feel more comfortable with people having blades because , uh , you're not going to get bullets flying around killing people instantly 
and , uh , 
well , if i'm the one doing the shooting i don't miss . 
that's the kind of training i've had . 
i mean  . . . 
this is really ironic that i would get this subject today because just yesterday our dog ran away .
oh , no . 
and it's just been tearing me up all day .
oh , i bet . 
because we have just been looking all over for him . 
we've been to the pound , 
we've been to the humane society , 
we've been to the adoption center , 
we've just been all over the neighborhood , 
we've been calling neighbors .
so this is just really strange .
oh , i guess so . 
have you lost him before ? 
um , he's gotten out before , 
but he's always stayed right here 
he's never gone away . 
and so this is just really strange , you know because , 
what kind of a dog is he ? 
um , he's part golden lab and part , uh ,  , let's see , alaskan , no , not alaskan . 
i always forget .
uh , australian shepherd . 
boy , he's a big one . 
that's why it really surprises me , you know , that he hasn't come back , because , like i said , he's never gone away like this before , 
and , i would think , you know , i mean , he might could get hurt by a car or something . 
i don't know that he could really get killed that easily because he is so big . 
you know , but , .
oh , well , i hope he comes back , 
i do , too .
how long have you had him ? 
oh , about two years . 
so , he's  , 
oh , that's tough . 
it's really , 
isn't that funny how we do ? 
i mean , we just really , 
well , you know , they're always there for you 
and they don't talk back to you .
and , uh , it's kind of pleasant . 
well , they're companions , 
well , do you have any ? 
and her name is angel . 
and we have a cat , he's just a tabby , just a , 
and his name is dominique . 
we call him neek . 
how do they get along together ? 
pretty good . 
uh , the dog first , 
and , uh , she's kind of a wimp 
but , uh , she likes him all right . 
we had another cat about two years ago . 
it got feline leukemia 
and , uh , then we got this new cat , 
so , uh . i have two children 
and they really enjoy the animals . 
and then my mother who's very elderly lives with us , 
and she's really good friends with the dog . 
they're very ,
oh , yeah . 
that's what are so neat about animals , 
i mean , they're really companions , you know , 
and they're friends ,
that's right . 
i mean , you can love them all you want 
and they love you right back 
and they don't  , 
that's right . 
they don't care what you look like ,
they just love you , unconditionally . 
i know . 
it's wonderful . 
it's just so neat . you know , 
i don't know  , 
this is just so hard . 
oh , i know it has to be . 
it's like i said , we've had him for two years 
and he's never , 
i mean , he's gotten out , 
but he's always been right there . 
he's never been gone for , at all 
 you know , he's just always been right there when he gets out . 
you know , it's the first time he's ever been gone like this .
oh , that's really too bad , 
that's awful , well , 
uh , i just knew today , uh , you know , that we looked at the pound , and that we just went all over the place , 
and i knew we were going to find him , you know , 
so i don't know . 
well , i hope you'll find him . 
you most likely will . 
we keep , you know , 
well , have you put any posters up or anything like that ? 
we were talking about that tonight since , you know , he just got out yesterday 
we were just talking about that whether 
we were trying to find some pictures of him recently . 
we've got so many when he was a puppy  , 
you know , but we just don't have a whole lot . 
we have him on film , you know , on the video camera .
you know , but you can't put that on the  , 
you sure can't . 
you know ,  ,
oh , dear . 
some posters and stuff up .
well , that's good . 
and hopefully that will help , you know , maybe around the neighborhood . 
but , we know a lot of people that live in this neighborhood , 
so that helps , too , you know , if they can keep , 
they can keep their eyes open , 
yeah , 
that will help . 
i think that if somebody else picks him up , 
i think that , uh , if he gets out he'll come back . 
you know . i really do , because he knows exactly where he lives , 
he will . 
i bet he does . 
i know , that it's hard on you . 
i know that i'd be worried , too . 
i know . 
it's just so ironic that this would happen 
and i would get this kind of a call .
isn't it , though ? 
it's very strange 
you know , i know sometimes our cat will stay out all night , 
and when he's not right at the door in the morning i really worry that something's happened to him , that he's got in a fight or , you know , somebody's hit him 
 and uh , if he doesn't come by mid morning , then i really get scared . 
but he's always come back eventually 
well , that's good . 
that's one thing about cats though , 
they're so small 
 and , you know , they can get hurt a lot easier . 
you know , they can get hurt a lot easier ,
they can . 
so that would make you really ,
well , but he's a real feisty guy . 
he fights with other cats in the neighborhood because he doesn't want them on our property . 
is that right ? 
cats are really almost more territorial than dogs are . 
they just really do not want other animals on their property . 
they're very 
 , he just 
any cat that comes near , and even a dog he won't jump at them or anything , 
but he'll sit 
and he'll watch , 
and , i think maybe he would if it came real close , 
but he's very protective of our property . 
that's really , 
i guess i really don't know cats that well because my mother never liked them , 
so i never had them growing up , 
so , you know , i never really had them around me , you know , 
so i've never owned one  , you know , since i , 
well , they're really a lot different than dogs because they're very independent , 
and he's very affectionate when he wants to be , 
but if you want him to be and he doesn't want to be , he'll , you know either scratch you or run away . 
but when he wants to be , uh , he's really affectionate . 
he likes to lay next to you and have you scratch his head and snuggle up to you , 
but if he's not in the mood , you'd better stay away from him . 
but , dogs seem to be always in the mood . 
they're always , you know , right there , and like you to pet them and loving . 
that's true .
i like the way they come up 
and they'll put their head underneath your hand , you know . 
and , uh , most dogs do that . 
i mean , 
they do . 
i don't know any that really don't . 
i mean , you know , they know exactly how to get that attention , you know , 
they sure do . 
they just , you know , come up , 
and they put your , you know 
 or they'll rub their head against you , you know .
now , do you keep him indoors most of the time other than to go outs , 
well , no . 
and then we get home at night we do bring him in . 
you have a fenced yard or , 
uhhuh . 
that's why we couldn't understand why he would want to get out  ,
well , how did he get out ? 
he dug a hole under the fence . 
oh , boy . 
well , see , he did it a couple weeks ago , dug a hole , 
and , you know , we filled it back up 
he did it again 
 so we chained him up 
 you know , but we really didn't want to keep him chained up because , you know , we feel like that's just too restricting for him . 
so , uh , we put dirt in the hole and then put some chicken wire around it , you know , so that he couldn't get out . 
well , he kind of ripped through the chicken wire .
so i can't , 
i just have not , 
i don't understand , you know , because it's , like , he's got a good home , you know , 
he's got , 
i mean , we have two kids , you know , that just love him a lot , 
you know , it's like we can't understand why he kept wanting to get out , you know , 
we just couldn't , 
well , you know , that , animals are like that . 
they like to roam and investigate .
i guess that's , 
i guess that's probably true . 
i don't think it's anything we did .
least i hope not .
i'm sure that , yeah , 
i know , 
i mean you know , he really does have a good home . 
i think that's what really bothers me the most about it .
you know , it's like , 
how are your kids handling it ? 
well , i don't know if it's quite hit them . 
i have two girls , 
and they just been real , uh , 
i don't know , 
at first , you know , they seemed to be upset , 
that sounds like kids . 
poor buddy , you know . 
and you already want to replace him .
what's his name , 
did you call ? 
that died . 
is that right  ? 
oh , yeah . 
and we used to , 
we were really into that when we got him going to the ranger games , 
and we named him buddy beaner for some reason . 
but , buddy after buddy bell , 
that's funny . 
but , he was a good cat , too . 
we miss him a lot , 
and i feel real guilty because we had him , like , for six years 
and one year i forgot to get him his leukemia booster 
and he got it . 
and i just felt so bad , 
it's real contagious 
and it's , 
and the vet  , 
i didn't know that . 
and if they don't have their booster , any kind of saliva or anything from another cat , if they get in a fight it automatically , like , 
they get it if the other cat has it 
i had no idea . 
i did not know that . 
it was , 
i just felt terrible . 
i knew something was wrong with him because his appetite was , 
he was just getting real skinny . 
okay , uh , 
well , uh , i don't do it as much as i should . 
i try to walk . 
and , uh , last year i did it every day , 
but in ninetyone i've kind of gone down hill . 
and so i'm not doing it as much as i need to , 
but do it on a regular basis i feel so much better 
i agree .
but it's just to get motivated to do it , 
and once i get started , i do it every night . 
it's just to get , uh , motivated again , 
and what happened about couple of weeks ago i started again . 
and i was walking , 
and it got kind of dark . 
and i was by myself , 
and there was this fellow in this truck that kept circling the block . 
and , so i kind of got frightened , 
and i kind of use that as an excuse . 
all i have to do ,
i haven't walked since , 
it's always easy to find an excuse not to exercise . 
i know what you mean . 
it sure is . 
how about you ? 
do you exercise on a regular basis ? 
um , i started at the beginning of this year , 
i'm going to be real good , 
and i went through the t i fitness center and registered for the , uh , aerobics classes there . 
and they run for two months at a time . 
and you do have to pay to take them . 
and i signed up for one that was three nights a week , an hour and a half , 
so that was four and a half hours a week . 
and it cost sixty dollars , 
that'll encourage me to always go since i spent that much money . 
and i had a friend of mine going , 
so i was real good , 
i only missed it about three times . 
and then , oh , march came around , 
and i signed up again , 
and i got , uh , caught up with a class i was taking at t i , 
and then i was having to work some real late hours to get caught with my work after i got out of class . 
and then i went to colorado springs the next week to do some training at the t i up there . 
and so that was two weeks i had missed , 
and , boy , i tell you what , i've been terrible ever since then . 
it's once you get out of that habit 
because i teach school , 
and last year a bunch of teachers had an aerobics class . 
we went in together and hired a private instructor , 
and she came to our school twice a week . 
and , i was , 
i would go faithfully , 
and then i missed once . 
then i went back again a couple times and missed another time , and then kept missing and never went back again . 
i think , if you , 
you just have to stick with it . 
oh , yeah . 
i think i've been two maybe three times the month of april , 
and this session is about to run out . 
now i signed up for a different one now that's only two nights a week because i am getting kind of into a real busy schedule as far as teaching a lot of training classes 
and , uh , that just kind of throws my whole schedule off on doing that . 
lately , uh , there's been nights that i could have gone 
and i've found excuses , uh 
but i'm fine this week . 
i could have gone monday . 
i could have gone tonight , 
and i didn't . 
so , i'm kind of finding excuses , 
and now it's kind of like , well , 
this is the last week . 
i'll just start fresh next week . 
but , i  , better do it . 
and i think another thing is that my friend that was taking with me the first two months wasn't the second two months . 
she started taking tennis lessons , 
and so i haven't had that extra motivation , or not forcing each other 
that makes a difference when you have somebody to go with and to do the same the same thing . 
like it's misery loves company . 
i don't really love exercise . 
i mean , some i , 
the neighbor across the street , she belongs to president's , 
and , uh , it's not president's any more . 
i don't know what the name of it is anymore . 
but she loves it . 
i mean , it's an automatic high for her . 
she just enjoys it so much . 
and i don't . 
i'm the same way . 
i feel good after i do it , 
but i hate it when i'm doing it . 
you know , i just , 
i don't enjoy it at all , 
and she just loves it . 
so . even when she doesn't go to the health club , she runs , you know . 
 and , it's a daily thing for her . 
so , it , you know , 
and it's so hard for me . 
i envy her , 
i wish i could be that way , 
but i don't . 
i do too . 
and i have an older sister that loves running , too , 
and she runs all the time , 
but to me , it's every minute's agony , 
and i , 
in fact , i don't run . 
i hate to run . 
like when i walk i'll take along a radio or something 
and that helps , you know , pass the time . 
walking is kind of boring . 
i do have a few friends that live in my apartment complex in this neighborhood , 
and we used to try to get together , 
and i think now that the weather's getting nicer we're going to start doing it again and occasionally go walking . 
there's a real nice residential area right behind our apartment complex . 
and it's not as boring if you get several people 
that's right . 
 and you can kind of talk , 
it makes it pass pretty quickly , 
and the aerobics isn't too boring . 
i kind of enjoy it when i'm doing it . um , 
it's a lot more fun than some other things i could do , i guess . 
but , uh , i do have to make myself go , 
and of course while i'm doing it i feel pretty good , 
and after i get finished i feel great . 
oh , it's great afterwards , 
i mean , i can go in there , 
i can be , 
like a friday afternoon when i'm tired , it's the end of the week and i just want to go home . i'll make myself go , 
and i'll have headache and everything , 
and i get out , 
i don't have a headache any more . 
i feel great , 
and i'm just , 
it's amazing how much better i feel . 
and then just in general , i sleep a lot better 
that's right . 
 and i just feel much better . 
i mean , i've been kind of dragging the last few weeks , 
and i know if i would just get around to exercising 
it does , 
it gives you energy . 
but my dragginess is my excuse for not exercising . 
well , i just got over the flu , 
and i'm still kind of draggy 
so i better not go .
i find , too , that i have more energy when i exercise , 
and , you know , it's silly not to , 
but , i don't know , 
it's just a put off . 
i don't know why i don't do more , 
and i know that it's good for my health . 
i know , you know , from everything that you read and you see on television now , exercise is so important to good health . 
so , you know , you know , you're not only doing something to keep yourself fit , but you're probably prolonging your life . 
there's no reason that we shouldn't do it , 
but i don't know . 
it's just hard to make yourself go . 
and i think one thing i don't like about aerobics is that after i'm finished it's kind of late at night , 
and i've been sweaty , 
 and it , you know , 
i don't really feel like going in the grocery store all sweaty or running errands . 
so it kind of kills the evening for doing errands . 
so i think a tuesday thursday might be a little bit better . 
of course , i feel like once i've done it , if i'm sweaty i might as well do an extra thirty minutes  , because you've already kind of shot your night . 
but , um , so i'm kind of glad they have a longer class on thursday now that i can just kill two nights , and 
does it cost the same for just two nights or , 
well , that's good , too . 
this one was only fortyfive dollars . 
but i'm glad it's not too totally cheap , because if it was too cheap i would talk myself out of going more , probably . 
that's right , 
so hopefully . 
and they have a really nice facility at the t i . 
they've got two different aerobics rooms , 
they have the mirrors . 
of course , sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall 
you don't like to see how you work . 
but , i guess , sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going . 
and then they hire private instructors ? 
oh , that's great . 
and they have ceiling fans in the rooms , 
and it's a pretty nice setup . um , 
and of course it's real convenient , because it is right there at work . 
i think if i had to come home and then go somewhere , i'd never make it . 
and just the fact that i can go straight from my desk over to the recreation center and do it helps a lot . 
i can see that would be , uh , easy . 
they make it as easy as they possibly can for you . 
oh , yeah .
well , um , do a lot of people take advantage of it ? 
they have probably , ooh , i'd say fifteen to twenty different aerobics classes each session that are running , 
and they have them anywhere from six in the morning . uh , 
they have some during lunch hour that are shorter , 
and i guess guys can take advantage of that . 
for me , i wouldn't have time to do an get dressed again . 
oh , yeah . 
but there's a lot more guys that do that one . 
 and , um , they have them , you know , in the evenings , 
they even have some late night ones for people that work second shift and things like that . 
so they have big variety . 
they even have some , uh , uh , water aerobics when the weather gets nice out in the pool . 
i've never done that one before . 
oh , you have a pool there , too ? 
oh , how nice . 
they've got an olympic pool , and basketball courts and sand volleyball . 
they've got the full weight room and , uh , the locker rooms with , uh , a jacuzzi and sauna and the shower facilities , and hair dryers , and you know , everything you'd need just about . 
it is a real nice facility . 
it's also got a full inside basketball court , 
and i think they're working on building a jogging track and some other things . 
but it is very nice . 
that's great . 
i just don't take as much advantage of it as i should . 
now to use , 
i mean , i'm just now finally starting to do the aerobics thing . 
well , does it cost money like to go swimming . 
do you have to pay for that , too . 
and it's about eight dollars a month . 
oh , that's not bad . 
not at all .
pretty cheap . 
and then the aerobics cost extra even if you have the fitness membership , 
but , i think the aerobics classes are even pretty reasonably priced , from what i've heard . 
i think so too , 
well , and people of all ages take advantage of the aerobics ? 
oh , yeah , 
i'll let you go first . 
oh , well , what's there to say ? 
doesn't seem like it's being carried out very well in my opinion . 
seems like it takes so long between conviction and carrying out the penalty that i don't see that it makes any difference to sentence anybody . 
it seems like they could die of old age waiting to get the death penalty . 
yeah , 
i know what you mean . 
um , i , 
in maryland they do have capital punishment , 
 and , uh , i've seen , uh , a lot of people get sentenced , 
and then just nothing happens ,
well from what i underst , 
i saw a statistic just a few days ago , um , so far this during a year's time , i think it was they executed twentyfive people in the nation . 
meanwhile , there were twentyfive hundred people on death row . 
so i , 
and it's building up , you know , 
they're convicting them faster than they're executing them 
so it's really building up . 
what's amazing is some of them have been on death row for a number of years . 
 and , uh , here in maryland i know we have a real problem with overcrowding in prisons , uh , 
everybody's got that . 
but i mean , in , 
here it's , uh , to the point where they were letting prisoners go .
 and it was just , uh , amazing to me , 
and of course they made a big deal out of the few that got out and turned around and committed a crime within five days of getting out ,
isn't maryland where the famous willy horton case was . 
uh , i can't remember . 
refresh my memory . 
in the presidential race . 
uh , it may not have been maryland . 
it may have been massachusetts , 
i don't remember . 
um , i don't remember myself . 
 um , i think it might make a difference . 
right now ,
if it , 
i don't see someone not going out there and committing murder because they're afraid they're going to get sentenced to death . 
i mean , 
they just don't care . 
well i think in large measure the reason they don't care , 
it's not because the punishment , 
but so many of the people that commit crimes don't get punished . 
the police don't catch them , 
or the courts don't convict them , 
 or they don't serve very much of the time 
and so , uh , you know , their success rate is very high . 
crime does pay , 
you can make a good living at it . 
and uh , there's a lot of people here in baltimore that , uh , have 
and we just had , uh , a real big cocaine bust , 
and of course , you know , looked like it was a very , very small ring 
and they just happened to get lucky and catch the guy . 
 but , i mean , uh , baltimore has , uh , an all time record for the number of deaths so far this year . 
i think they've got over a hundred dead already this year . 
last year it was d c , 
i guess baltimore caught them . 
and you have to remember that uh , there's , i think , x number of people out there that are going to commit murders , 
 and , uh , once you kill off a few of them  , 
 i mean if you murder a guy because he murdered your partner or something like that , i mean pretty soon you run out of people to murder . 
the only consolation is so many of the murders are , you know , 
the , the violent people going against each other 
and so they , you know , 
society's not going to put them to death , 
well at least maybe the guy they cross next time is going to . uh , 
and we are there by going to remove them from society , not temporarily , but permanently . 
i mean , i personally think life imprisonment , 
i don't think much of life imprisonment . first of all , it's never , turns out to be life , 
but second , you know , why should we , 
the idea of life imprisonment with no chance of parole . 
well that means you're going to put them in a cage you think it's never ever going to be safe for them to walk the streets again , 
well then , why bother . 
just execute them , because that way you're sure they'll never ever going to walk the streets again . 
you know , it makes sense , um , you know , 
you have the occasional person who may have been falsely accused , but i mean , uh , so few and far between , uh , you know , 
makes good t v movies 
and that's about it . 
the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false 
but rather it's on the rules of evidence , what can i hide and what do i have to tell . 
and i think our courts should be geared much more strongly towards finding out the truth than they currently are . 
and that way we can be sure , you know , 
we can find out the truth , 
we can find out what really happened sentence on what the person did , not on what we're allowed to let the jury hear .
i had , 
uh , a jury trial , 
he was actually on the jury , 
 and , uh , this man was accused of killing , uh , i think it was two people , uh , and shooting a , uh , policeman , um , point blank in the face . 
of course he didn't die . 
 and , uh , this was during a holdup of uh , uh , a restaurant 
and it came out during the trial that , um , they had tried to rob another place 
and , uh , when the guy came out with the bag they thought was money , it turned out to be a couple uh , you know , jumbo cookies 
and so they were so upset from robbing this guy , you know , trying to do this holdup that didn't work that they quite literally were mad and went into a restaurant to hold the place up and just started , you know , shooting people . 
just started shooting people , 
you know it's , 
and get even with who , 
i mean , 
 you know , stupid guys .
and , uh , it turned out that the , you know , policeman survived to the point that he was able to , you know , identify the guy . 
 and of course , you know , they tried to make the cop look like he was , uh , a , uh , no good rotten drunk . 
 i mean it was amazing . 
so what was the verdict , 
what was the results there . 
oh , he was found guilty , 
he , uh , um , 
last i heard , uh , he beat a push for the death penalty . 
now whether they finally got it or not , i don't know . 
i kind of , uh , stopped listening after a while . 
um , you know , he would come home 
and , you know , after the trial was over he came home and told us what was going on 
and of course then they had to go back to dec , you know , 
after he had to go , 
the penalty phase , 
they've , decide the penalty separately from the verdict . 
 and you know , that's the way they wanted to do it . 
and he was surprised because he thought there was going to be a problem because he , uh , 
you know some people on the case were a little hesitant on convicting him on some of the charges 
but i mean when it all came down , they just , within an hour decided the man's fate . 
well , you know , you just have to decide , you know , wha , yo , 
well there's really two separate decisions there i guess , 
one is , did it really happen the way the prosecutor said it happened , you know , 
is this man really guilty , 
and you have to decide that , 
but then you have to decide , you know , as a member of society what do i want to do with this guy who did this thing . 
and that w , 
i've never been on a jury , 
i've never had that experience , 
i'm not sure i'd look forward to making that kind of decision about a man's life . 
well , pretty quick from what he said . 
 but i mean there's a lot of other crimes out there , i mean besides murder , 
i think , uh , now if you're dealing drugs now , 
well the thing i'd be most likely to attach the death penalty to is the violence . 
i mean , ye , 
i can handle people selling drugs , you know , 
it's wrong , 
but it's not worth somebody getting executed for . 
but we hear so much about the violence and how it's not safe to walk the streets because you know , these random drive by shootings and that sort of thing . 
 and the people i'd most likely want to sentence to death are the people that just show a really low regard for human life . 
that , you know , 
you , never know when they're going to turn or hurt the next person because it doesn't really matter to them whether someone else gets hurt or not . 
i agree . 
and so i go , le , 
i agree , 
uh , that kind of person . 
and , uh , as far as , uh , you know 
there are some other crimes that i think , uh , you know , uh , 
kidnapping , um , you know , when they , 
i mean kidnapping per se has a certain , uh , uh , fine and penalty associated with it , 
 but , um , some of these people are just out and out brutal . 
some of the cases i've heard about over the years , 
i pay a good deal of taxes i guess , because i make a fair amount of money , 
and , uh , the taxes that i pay , um , i guess i guess i get my money's worth for . 
i'm not sure , though , whether i feel , 
i guess i am sure that i feel that , in general , though , uh , the allocation , uh , of the taxes in certain areas , isn't correct . 
well , i'm sure that , uh , probably every person in this country would agree with you on that .
well , i , 
lately , i guess , um , uh , or , at least for the last twenty years or so , i've felt that the expenditures of our taxes into high cost , uh , defense items , at least in the last ten years , have been , uh , 
there's been and extraordinary amount of money spent there , 
and i'm not really sure that we've gotten our money's worth there , uh , regardless of the outcome of the desert storm , uh , 
uh , i guess my particular beef is that having participated in the over the years of being called back and things of that nature , is , uh , i've found that , you know , there's an extraordinary amount of waste . 
i take that as a given in any military operation 
oh yeah , 
no argument here . 
and i gue , 
what the problem , 
why in the , uh , mideast , uh , uh , over the , uh , iraqis , uh , might lead us into , uh , a false sense of security that we can do that against any other foe . 
i don't know what other foe that would be , 
but , uh , i'm just getting nervous again , now hearing the voices come up that there has to be increased expenditures in that area . 
well , of course , uh , missiles and things were expended in the course of fighting the war , 
and the inventory's going to have to be restocked , uh , 
now i work for t i , 
and one of the things we were told is , like , they had eleven thousand harm missiles which t i is the sole supplier for , 
and they used up two thousand of them in the war , 
so they're going to have to do another contract to restock that , to get ready in case something else is needed . 
but , it , 
would that be , uh , 
well , let's see , 
two thousand out of eleven thousand , that's about a little over twenty per cent . uh , 
when the soviet threat , i guess , was perceived as being a greater one . 
i don't think there's very much of a threat there today . 
i do worry about what nuclear weapons are left uh , in their territory over there , and who's controlling them , 
but  , 
that's true , 
what amount of , our hardware would stop some fanatic , i guess , from doing anything , uh , that would be irrational . 
well , of course now , we used up twenty per cent of that inventory ,
and , uh , uh , uh , t i also makes the missile , which was the t v laser guided bombs 
 and , a big percentage of that was expended , as well , 
that was just a matter of , 
oh , what is the name of that ? 
uh , it's called paveway . 
and , uh , a big percentage of that was used up during that conflict also . 
so some short term business to restock that . 
well , uh , i'm , 
what i'm , 
uh , i guess uh , it , 
concerned about , 
talking about the taxes in general , and i perceive as not being the best expenditure for the amount of dollar that we're taxed for , uh , in the area of defense , 
or perhaps we have paid too much there , 
i don't know , 
it just seems to me that over the years , now , the , 
it's a cliche , 
but i see it myself , 
i see where the infrastructure is sort of breaking down , the roads , the highways . 
oh , no doubt . 
i don't know , uh , 
some upbeat school areas , 
so i don't totally agree expenditure of effort and time there , 
but i guess overall , because i guess i'm not associated with what ghetto schools , i should imagine that would take an enormous expenditure . 
as a matter of fact , in texas , um , we've had our school funding system declared unconstitutional by a state judge , 
and they , 
and , uh , the legislature just passed what they called a robin hood bill , which , 
basically , what it does , is it takes extra money from the more affluent school districts , you know come from local taxes 
they don't have a broad based income tax that funds the educational system , 
 uh , well , 
 or is it all funded out of local taxes ? 
this town that i had lived in for sometime in nineteen eightythree was funded sixtyfive per cent by state funds . 
but , they forgot to put in the state budget the money to pay for it , 
and they dumped it all on the local school districts . 
sounds like the way the federal and state system works now . 
 so , so what ended up happening was a shift . 
we went to sixtyfive per cent state funding to sixtyfive per cent local funding in a matter of four years . and , uh , i mean , 
it's all shifted to local districts , 
and now , even the money that's been raised for the local districts is going to be siphoned off and sent to other parts of the state . 
minimum level , that's a standard 
but , i am opposed to , any attempts to restrict , um , local communities from taxing themselves above that to provide above the minimum . 
i see what you're saying . 
uh , uh , a strong and staunch supporter of some subsidy for any forms of education . 
i mean , by that i mean , i'm a product myself , 
i have , uh , uh , getting my college education through the g i bill . 
so did i . 
my masters , anyway . 
but , uh , when i look at it to me , uh , it doesn't really make any difference . 
it was a marvelous opportunity that i couldn't have done , 
i don't think i would have gone on , unless i had that financial 
that's right . 
and whether you're a veteran or whether you , 
i don't even know if you have to perform community service , 
or unless , uh , that , the subsidy itself , 
or i guess the enactment of that form of legislation ,
at least what i read , is that some younger people feel that education is priced uh , out of their , uh , budget . 
i know in the state of florida just today , uh , the legislature , uh , adjourned , 
and , uh , they had completed a fifteen per cent increase which isn't , i mean , 
to me it doesn't sound like a lot of money , 
but i guess it would be for fifteen hundred dollars a year . 
they went from eleven to fifteen hundred , 
 and , uh , for an out of state student the tuition went up twentyfive per cent . 
i don't know what that would be . 
they had to raise , uh , community college taxes here , a few years ago . 
but uh , program now is , uh , 
fees that fund these things , i guess that's trickled down to the states 
so they must charge fees . uh , 
i'm not too sure of that reasoning . 
but i guess to get back to the main topic , i don't know whether i pay too much taxes . 
i travel extensively in europe and see enormous , uh , 
people pay , uh , a great deal in taxes , 
they tell me when i sit and talk to people 
there they tell me they , 
some states they pay , uh , 
in germany or fiftyfive percent of their gross income in taxes . 
oh , oh , i can believe that . 
 but , i'm not too sure when i put my property tax in , my car tax , my income tax , and these myriad of , uh , 
now it costs me money to leave the country , some sort of a tax to leave the country ,
i'm not sure that i'm not up fairly close to that . 
well , i guarantee if , uh , the democrats had more say . 
you really think so ? 
but i mean , is 
i feel that in the last ten years , uh , my taxes have gone up , 
they haven't gone down . 
i pay uh , 
everybody is . 
 but that's been a republican government for the last ten years . 
well , what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase .
well i , 
well , this has been really interesting , 
and i've enjoyed our talk . 
okay , uh , 
and that's it . 
don , good talking with you . 
nice talking with you , too . 
um , i think life , uh , 
now i grew up on a farm , 
i don't , 
what kind 
did you  grow up  in the farm . 
i grew up in , um , 
so , and it was a suburb of  trenton   , 
so i really had mixture of suburb ,
i think though it was much slower and , uh , much more selfcontained . 
i think you're right . 
it's interesting 
um , i work in a high school . 
so , uh , i'm comparing my life when i was in high school thirty years ago to what i see these children doing . 
and the pressures on the children , uh , you know , 
you hear this as an excuse , 
but it's true they are so much greater . 
unreal by comparison . 
oh , i cannot believe , uh , what they're doing , uh , academically the demands on them 
uh , and i can see why children do drop out . 
i think that's right . 
i can see the , uh , you know , 
i can remember as a child , you know , nobody ever worried about me wondering out at night and going where i wanted to go . 
it didn't occur to nobody to worry that anything would happen to me 
they were , 
and you didn't have to lock your door . 
and , uh , a lo , 
some of these are urban worries 
but , uh , uh , it's a lot different all though i guess twenty years a go now , in this area , things were , um , similar because twenty years ago 
let's see , 
it was after , 
it's not all that long ago is it .
yeah , to 
twentyfive years ago is when we had the washington riots , 
the first rights we've been having some problem now 
and it reminded me of that . 
we were living in new jersey .
in  allendale  .
and , uh , i use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on ,
um , i don't know though 
it's kind of hard to really know because of 
though the news media had those riots , uh , kind of blown up out of proportion . 
 because i went there many times 
the washington riots weren't , 
because  , 
because i lived right downtown ,
was what you got .
that's what , 
but , you know , it is interesting , uh , 
they're so many mor , 
they're different kind of dangers that face young people now and social pressures , uh , 
the pressures of drug is so much , 
the prevalence is so much greater , 
the kinds of diseases that you've got out the , uh , um , 
 i mean the consequences is 
so much of what's going on ,
i think that's true , 
i think the other thing is that , uh , we have taken some rather drastic turns when i'm number one , you know , and , uh , uh , uh , worrying about self and not , uh , seeing the consequences of the disintegration of the family . 
the kind of support that they need ,
if you don't have some kind of basic believe or something down inside of you ,
that's true . 
i also being involved in the school system see so many of the problem children coming from their parents , um , children who will lie and cheat 
and you approach their parents , 
and their parents are constantly justify them rather then to , 
 uh , you know , they're constantly ,
 like   .
and you can see exactly ,
you as a teacher , can't hold a child accountable ,
that's right . 
and you can't make up in a classroom of one hour a day ,
that's right . 
 and you get mixed signals 
so it's not always the school's systems 
i think a lot of , 
there's so much more , then that 
it starts ,
i think that too . 
i see some flickers uh , of good directions turning , 
  no  .
 but whether they're soon enough and fast enough i don't know , 
it's just , 
of course , life is a lot more complicated too in ways , um , 
the kinds of jobs that people need to be trained ,
uh , you know , with farming being so mechanized ,
factory jobs are so much more , um , uh , sophisticated . 
that's right . 
and the kinds of knowledge that , uh , you know , 
it's requiring an increasingly sophisticated labor force 
and there's the drop outs and the , 
 and you worry when , 
that's just another , 
 uh , in terms of what it's going to mean to a society ,
some ways it's rather frightening , 
it really is 
it just is almost overwhelming sometimes when you think ,
it certainly is . 
 well , it sure is . 
uh , not that i really think that they were perfect ten , twenty , or thirty years ago , 
uh , yeah , 
 uh , it's not so much the kids , 
it's just the volume of it ,
 uh , i look at my mother's life 
i mean she didn't work , um , um , 
for a long time when i was very young she didn't drive . 
uh , she learned to drive i think when i was , um , a teenager , 
and her life was a lot simpler , 
right and , 
 and i sit here , 
somebody was there . 
that's right . 
 and when there's nobody there , 
that's right , 
i always thought too that , you know , people worrying about going to work when their children are little 
and i think that's sad if they have to because they miss so much , 
but i believed after having a few teenagers that the worst time you could go ,
they need  you more as a teenager  .
isn't that true . 
that's why i'm working in a school system so that i'm home when they're home . 
it's not so much that they come to you every minute , 
but it's that you are there when they need you . 
that's exac , 
isn't that , 
that's so true , 
 uh , uh , i find working in a high school is very helpful because it lets me be a little more tolerant and understanding of what people do , 
 and it keeps me from being the old  fogy  
so , but at the same time ,
i think that's true . 
as to what's com , 
but  that's  the same 
i'm home in the summers , 
i'm home with the holidays , 
i'm home at three o clock when the children are at home 
or where home , 
one is now a senior in high school and the other's in college , 
 and , uh , 
but that helps a lot , 
i have a daughter who just had a second job , 
she needed to work 
and he opted to go into a day care center where she could have her children with her .
that's right . 
 uh , and so i , 
   , you know , good kind of experience as well 
but , uh , 
 well i , 
i think that's really important 
i don't think people realize how important it is . 
that is so true , 
yeah , uh , 
 and it's not that the children always say something 
but every once in awhile they'll come up and make a comment , 
 and you realize it's important that , uh , 
and yet , you know , we have to make that choice 
i think twenty , thirty years ago a lot of women ,
i think that's right . 
what was your name again ? 
well , i , 
linda lee . 
and your name was ? 
 well i enjoyed ,
i'm going to , 
but , uh , 
it's nice talking to you , too . 
bye now . 
tell me , what are some of the things that you did with your children when they were growing up ? 
oh , well , uh , when they were little , we did lots of reading and playing and going to parks ,
they were both interested in things like model rockets , 
so we would go to the football field and set off model rockets .
i have two boys also .
uh , my children um , are swimmers , 
and so as they were growing up much of , uh , our , um , normal life outside of school and everything uh , revolved around their swimming . 
so , in order to have a reason for being there , especially as they got older , i became involved in it too 
so we were always together at their meets . 
oh , well , that's good . 
um , mine were not terribly sporting . 
uh , they both did tball and soccer in grade school , 
but neither one of them carried on , uh , the sports after that . 
the boys tried those , 
but they did go in , 
they started swimming when they were , oh , seven and eight , 
and they really loved it , 
and they're swimming both c , 
they'll be , 
one is in college , also swims in college , 
and the other will continue to swim in college , 
and they're fortunate , 
they even made nationals . 
oh , wonderful! 
 oh that's great! 
 and so we would drive up to see that whenever it was reasonably close , 
but , we did a lot of things , um , 
and we tried to do things both together and individually with the children , um . 
we live near washington , 
so we would always go in for the museums . 
that's always a big , uh , thing . 
and one of my children is , uh , also a musician 
so , um , one of the things that we did with him a lot was to go , either my husband or i , or both of us would , t , concerts with him . 
and my other child , um , uh , is big into tropical fish , 
so our whole family , we take family trips to different places to visit or go to fish shows , 
so  , 
my goodness , uh . 
well , we didn't have any , uh , avid , uh , activities like that , 
they were interested in a lot of things , 
but nothing to quite that depth , i guess . 
but , we would , 
oh my goodness . 
well , we did go to things like aquariums and , uh , 
in fact , it's funny , 
our vacations have always been , um , uh , uh , as they've gotten older . 
when they were younger we would go to the beach , 
but as they got older we tried to pattern our vacations where we would travel and do things ,
uh , yes . 
one summer uh , we went up to new england 
and we went to the marble quarries up there , uh , 
oh ,  really  .
and of course we learned too . 
 uh , and , uh , i don't know , 
i , uh , 
when they were very young i did not work . 
well , i started working halftime when , uh , they were at the nursery school . 
 but i   
 and i started working parttime when they were in , um , junior high school and high school , 
now , and i worked in the school system , 
and now i work a full school day , 
but that leaves me off on holidays and summers . 
so it was a , you know , 
i think they need me more ,
well , uh , i think , uh , they need you in different ways . 
that's true , 
you want to be around for the crisis and things like that , 
that's right . 
um , yeah , 
that's for sure . 
do you have any feelings as to the trends that you see ? 
well , it lo , 
the one trend i would say is that with so many more women choosing professional careers ,
and i don't think it needs to be the mothers , 
but i think it would be nice if some of the parents would be around for a few more hours . 
when they    , you know 
it was funny , 
i can remember , 
and my mother and i have talked about it , how important it was when i came home from school . 
it wasn't really conversation , 
but there were always things that just tumbled out . 
and , uh , uh , granted the child doesn't always think that they're sharing it , 
but it , 
when it's not there they miss it . 
i think that's true , 
but i also think that's , at least in my experience , truer of girls than boys . 
even when i was there , my boys didn't share all that much with me , and certainly not to the extent i did with my mother . 
i realize that , 
but it's funny , 
they don't always do it , 
but occasionally they do , 
and you want , 
and when they do , there's a reason for it , that they're sharing it , 
and they were bouncing something off of me .
and it was , uh , 
 or if my husband , 
who would they ask ? 
that's right . 
or what would they do ? 
that's exactly right . 
uh , but i think because the society in which we live , families are separated . 
you don't have grandparents near by or aunts and uncles . 
um , i mean , i grew up in a situation where on weekends we were always visiting relatives . 
well , i did too . 
we were close to my , uh , maternal grandparents , i mean , just a few miles ,
they were fifty miles away 
see , and we're , 
uh , that , 
i grew up with , you know 
every weekend there was some visiting somewhere . 
um , and it was sort of an italian family , 
um , but my children , 
we see , we , 
they don't ha , 
it's not that constant 
well , when my kids were quite small ,
and they saw them a lot , 
but they don't have any cousins , uh , 
or they didn't , 
 uh , their cousins are about ten years younger . 
so , uh , they never played together or anything . 
and there are only two of them 
and they didn't live in the same town . 
the trend of families and time , 
to take up the gap . 
that's right . 
and so the kids in some ways the family issues that get discussed ,
so to do it as well as we can . 
we keep in close contact with grandparents and talk over the phone , 
and cousins and aunts and uncles , 
and we do , 
but although it's not the same , we are , 
and that's part of , i think , teaching too , is what a family is like , 
because then how do they pattern their own ? 
well everyone makes its own model , 
but , uh , it seems that there should be some continuity , 
yeah , um . 
and it's helpful to have , uh , things that become family traditions , and that sort of thing . 
well , we have had this tradition , um , that we always go out before christmas and cut our own tree . 
and that's always been a little bit of a tradition that we've had . 
now , this year , it's , was hard with our son now being in college . 
so this was one thing that we , um , weren't able to do this year , 
but we did that from the time the children were young enough to realize what it was until , uh , our older son went away to college . 
oh , well , that's the kind of thing that they will remember , though . 
and we have advent calendars still ,
ours finally disintegrated . 
we had a felt one that was li , 
it was a christmas tree that had , uh , a little trinket for each day ,
oh , yes . 
and then you took it off and put it on the tree , 
so at the end you had a decorated tree . 
well , ours is , uh , 
a friend 
 and it finally got motheaten , 
we threw it way last year .
how nice . 
and , i mean , they look today as new as they did when she gave them to us , 
and there's a ring 
and you buy a present , 
oh , i see . 
and you wrap the present up , 
and i mean , the presents have gone from the days when they were very young to a little box of bandaids and an eraser and things , 
how cute . 
their future ,
so , i think as they're getting in college , i just , 
for my older boy that was in college i put a dollar bill for each day . which was the equivalent 
 oh , i'm sure he appreciated that! 
and , you know , it was fun , 
but that's a tradition 
and those will be passed on to them when they , 
well , you were saying what other trends are there , 
and one just occurred to me because i was editing a book about it recently , 
and that is the trend in a lot of , uh , lower class areas , for the grandmothers to be raising the children . 
and that's , 
a lot of it is due to the fact that the mothers are on drugs . 
the b , 
and the broken families . 
 um , as i said , living in an area of washington , d c .
and , uh , it's that grandmother figure , not only raising her own children , but raising , um , children from the streets , too , frequently . 
well , we had a sociologist at the center where i work who was writing a book on , uh , multigeneration ,
well , this is a si , 
uh , this is in fact , uh , 
we've been studying this in our school , that , um , this is one of the symptoms , or not the symptoms , 
it's one of the ways that young girls feel that they are maturing , 
it's a rite of passage .
well , myrna , how do you get your news ? 
uh , most of it is from the radio , uh , 
we usually watch the local news and the , uh , national news both . 
i'm pretty much the same . 
i find that , uh , 
i'm a graduate student 
and i read a lot for school 
and i find i have no patience to really read a newspaper because i'm reading so much all the time . 
and i really enjoy just sitting down and watching a news broadcast . 
well you can always get up and leave that .
yeah , that's true . 
uh , i just don't seem to have time to sit down and read the paper . 
by the time i get home from work ,
that's right , 
so , it's so much easier to sit there 
and besides , i can be doing other things and still listen to the news . 
that's right , 
i agree . 
a lot of times i eat while i'm uh , watching the news . 
yeah , 
the same thing . 
is there any , uh , 
what did you think about the coverage like over in the , uh , persian gulf ? 
i think they did a great job . 
i thought so too , 
it , you know , 
for a while when we were really interested , uh , we saw it all the time . 
some of the stations i guess carried it for twentyfour hours for a couple of days there 
and then , you know , the special reports and the extended news coverage i thought was really good . 
and you could always find some channel that had something on 
but you didn't necessarily have to watch the same thing all the time . 
just news , 
that's right , 
yeah , 
i noticed that one thing well they do have television monitors stationed throughout our buildings , 
and they used to have a program called t news , and just updates of different things that were going on within t i . 
well when all uh , uh , in the persian gulf came about they started carrying c n n . 
oh , yeah . 
well now , they have had so much good response from this ,
huh , well that's great . 
so , we can always run upstairs and , you know , 
or if you have a break in the middle of the day , you take a coffee break you can always stay informed . 
yeah , 
that's really good . 
rent a cable t v line , or whatever , you know . 
so i don't get c n n , uh , which was a big disappointment . 
i used to watch , 
that was my , 
if i wasn't home , 
i'm a college teacher 
and sometimes i teach in the evening 
so i'll miss the evening news . 
and uh , you could always catch a good news program at eight o'clock or nine o'clock on c n n . 
i think that's , 
we don't get it either , 
we live out in the country , 
and we just don't have it available out there where we are . 
but when we did have it , uh , that's what we usually watched ,
and sometimes we'd watch the weather stations . 
that's , uh , same , 
when i had it , i watched it , you know , religiously for half an hour 
and then you could go on , you know , to do what else you wanted to do . 
yeah 
i find i read very little , 
i don't even get a regular newspaper and , uh , because , uh , i don't drive that much , 
i only live about a mile from where i go to school and work , 
in the car that i don't really listen to the radio , you know , 
i don't , 
so television is my main new source . 
oh , i get that too , because i'm in a van pool , 
and i'm in the van , you know , uh , two hours a day 
oh really , 
to commute to work ? 
and it's dark thirty . 
but in the afternoon , uh , i try to read 
so i can , uh , not pay attention to what our driver is doing .
i can , 
the van pools i know that , 
and i'm in the baltimore , washington area , 
and i know they do van pool a lot here from some of the outer areas , 
but if you want a nicer home , you know , beyond the suburbs , you know , 
that's necessary . 
yeah . 
are you in baltimore itself ? 
and i go to a campus of the university of maryland that is just , less than a mile from my house . 
so i'm actually in baltimore , 
you could say i'm in baltimore . 
i have two kids over there . 
oh really , 
in baltimore ? 
u , well no , 
one works for the state department 
and , uh , uh , navy 
and he's stationed at bethesda 
oh that's a really nice area , bethesda area . 
uhhuh , 
um , it's funny , 
there's a big difference between baltimore and washington , even though they're so close . 
there's only an hour , less than that between the two 
but there is a big difference in things like property values 
and , um , the closer you get to washingt , d c the more expensive it is . 
and , um , the , uh , different slant . 
washington , it really is uh , uh , an international city , where baltimore is hometown baltimore . 
you know , there's really , uh , 
most people have relocated to the washington area , you know . 
oh no , 
i'd rather have baltimore with the home town atmosphere . 
i like it a little bit better , too . 
it's interesting though , um , to meet different populations . 
being , uh , from pittsburgh originally , 
i'm just now meeting different populations like chinese students and things 
and i find that really interesting , you know , to imagine , 
here is somebody that was in china , in , uh , beijing . 
you know , uh , interesting perspective . 
but i really 
much like the hometown area , 
and i think that also goes , 
it's funny , 
you can watch different news . 
i can watch washington news or baltimore news 
and i really do watch baltimore news . 
you know , that really makes , 
i don't really bother with the washington station because it's so far removed from what i'm interested in . 
well most of what they're talking about in washington is the crime problems that they're having there . 
it was just a big thing recently 
they've had some terrible problems with hispanics , 
um , they had to impose a curfew uh , in the washington suburbs . 
the mayor , 
they've gotten rid of that really bad mayor and then , uh , brought in , 
i heard about that . 
and then came a woman that's um , 
she's big in the democratic party 
so that's good , 
so she has good national ties , 
but she also was , um , something like a , uh , state auditor or something like that before this position . 
she was a state auditor , 
i guess she was an auditor general or something like that for the district of columbia , at washington . 
and then she left that to get a position with the democratic party 
and now she ran for mayor , 
so uh , fiscally she's pretty tight , and , uh , she's cleaning house 
and it looks like hopefully she'll do a nice job , uh , for washington , you know , which is , 
you sort of feel sorry for a lot of the people there . 
you know , from what i pick up on the news , uh , it's a difficult process , you know , to get rid of a bad mayor . 
well i know both of my kids didn't want to live anywhere around the downtown areas , 
they both moved way out . 
i think one of them lives in germantown 
and i can't remember where the other one lives . 
but germantown is a nice area . 
it's a nice area .
it's , means they have to drive a little bit , 
well they might be car pooling too . 
do they car pool in ? 
are they driven by themselves . 
uh , well now , i think he carpools , 
because he's got fairly regular hours since he came back , 
but , uh , now they have probably been carpooling together , in fact , 
because she had been called back up , active duty . 
and then she was supposed to have gotten out of active duty as of last friday . 
so , i haven't talked to them this weekend , 
i don't know what the situation is , 
but she was , 
they didn't call you for mother's day ? 
you weren't home ? 
uh , d , 
but called and left a message on our recorder 
but i had that from all my kids except for one . 
oh , that's good . 
well i guess we should stop now . 
well i thank you for calling , 
i have enjoyed it . 
oh good . 
uh , uh , so do i , 
i really enjoyed it . 
it's so funny when you live in one part of the country you only see that perspective . 
it's interesting to see the wider world , 
so i enjoy it . 
hey , thanks a lot , and bye . 
thank you , 
bye , bye . 
well , i do not know . 
how big a city is rome ? 
i mean , you have heard about dallas , 
and the crime here is pretty bad .
but , uh , 
i was going to say . 
we hear a lot about , uh , new york city . 
there is a lot of crime down there . 
and i am afraid to go down there because , you know , i mean , you hear about people getting mugged . 
you leave your car for ten minutes 
and it is stripped when you come back . 
have you ever been there ? 
only to the airport . 
that is , uh , probably enough to see .
um , are you in college right now ? 
oh , okay . 
so , there is a base up here . 
are base , 
that's interesting concept . 
are bases safe , you know ? 
bases are pretty safe because they check your i d on your way in . 
they , uh , minimize the access . 
but even so we had a , uh , uh , 
at new years ,
oh , no . 
oh , great . 
well , dallas , uh , 
we lived in minneapolis . uh , 
we moved here about ten months ago . 
and dallas is pretty , uh , 
well , we live in near a suburb called plano . 
so we are out of the city , 
but uh , it is bad everywhere in terms of , uh , you know , the handgun situation , um , the number of rapes , the number of muggings . 
just , it is , 
i would not say it is not as bad as new york , 
but it is pretty scary . 
you know , people put bars on their windows in certain neighborhoods 
you know . they call them ornamental grates . 
but they are still bars .
that makes it bad for getting out during a fire . 
it really does . 
and if you are a little bit claustrophobic 
but , uh . i do not know , 
i mean the jails are crowded . 
i am not a criminal justice specialist , 
so i do not know you know , what can be done . 
i am ,
i do not , 
it seems to , 
i think it is getting worse . because i keep hearing things 
like i went home , 
my parents live in boston . 
but i went home , 
and this thing came on where and robbing 
and it was really disgusting . 
and i mean , you he , 
were they teenagers 
like that girl in new york that got beat up by , you know , 
when she was jogging 
yeah . um , 
they were young men . 
but so they weren't , you know . 
and were they obviously poor or depri , you know ? 
that is really stra . 
like i say , s , 
i know it . 
how deprived could they be if they had a camcorder ? 
those are a thousand bucks . 
unless they stole it . 
and i mean , that is one big thing down here . 
i mean , they have like , uh , 
and they are not all young . 
i mean , they are eighteen to twentyfour , some of the young men and women . 
but , i mean , you can see the crime stoppers ads on television . 
and they are , 
sometimes it is the same people that have been observed 
and they still can't catch them .
and you are wondering how , you know . um , we lived in minneapolis and wisconsin . 
i mean , there was all kind of , 
i know it is getting worse . 
i do not know what the world is or is not . uh , 
the dimi , 
in a small town in wisconsin , near madison , um , a young boy somehow got a hold of a shotgun .
and the child had , 
and they said that he was twelve years old , 
and uh , he had not , uh , displayed any tendencies deviant or disturbed or whatever , you know . 
and you are thinking to yourself , um . 
i wonder where , 
i know . 
i do not know . 
i wonder where he gets it ? 
you know , you must , 
i think t v is bad . because they , uh , show all sorts of violence on , 
and i do not think a lot of parents , 
i mean , i do not know how it is in the air force base . 
but , uh , i just do not think a lot of people , because of the economy , both need to work , you know . 
i just do not think a lot of parents are that involved any more . 
they do not talk to their kids and take them out . 
so the kids are off to their own devices a lot . 
and discipline . 
i do not know how your folks were , 
but i mean i sure knew as heck when i was growing up that , uh , my parents were the superior 
and i was the subordinate . 
and , you know . 
oh , definitely . 
and i do not know , i think today a lot of parents , um , are ruled by their kids . 
i think so definitely . 
when you go to a restaurant , and like kids are running all over the place . they , 
i mean , they are not learning how to , uh , well , like boundaries . 
i mean , i see it in work place too , sometimes . 
i do not know how old you are , 
but you sound a little bit younger than me . 
but , i am in my thirties , 
and uh , i see , uh , even people that work with me that are ten years younger . 
that , you know , they kind of have an attitude that  , to say it , 
but that's just what it is . 
it is an attitude 
i see that too in the air force . 
do you ? 
oh , yeah . 
a lot of , uh , 
are you in the air force ? 
and so , uh , people outside the air force doing engineering get paid a lot more than we do . 
get it for all it is worth . 
and that ,
if you did not want to do it . 
and the air force is one of the military experiences . 
it is . 
i mean , 
i like it a lot .
pardon me ? 
i like it so far . 
i mean , that is , 
are you going to be a career person ? 
i'm digressing , 
so i am , 
but , uh , they pay for my college . 
that is the way to do it . 
i mean , and that's , 
you know , at least the air force is , 
i do not know , uh , i am nervous in dallas . 
i mean , you know , i mean , i go to like an aerobics class or something . 
and , you know , uh , seventy women in a jazzercise class in a public , uh , parks and rec building . 
and you are supposed to feel safe , 
but then there are all these , 
does not matter race , 
but , you know , it is an inter racial mix . 
and you see these guys standing there watching you jump around in your leotards . 
and i do not even think that way , 
but i mean , you just think to yourself , you just , i mean , 
nobody can think that it can't happen to them . 
no matter who they are 
or where they are at , you know . 
and you never know who is watching , either . 
i mean , did you , 
i do not know , i was in the grocery store this morning . 
we , uh , went to new orleans for four days and came back late last night , driving . 
and it is about seven hours . 
um , and that is a very , 
we had never been there . 
that is a very , very neat town to visit .
but the crime is so bad there . 
 i mean , in all the tourist brochures you read about what you should or should not do . 
how to carry 
this is new orleans ? 
oh , i would hate to be there during mardi gras . 
let me tell , 
i would never , 
you just do not . 
do not even bother . 
it is not worth it . 
uh , when we came back , i do not know if you have seen . 
i was in the super market this morning 
and on the cover of time magazine , there is a girl , she is in boston ? 
she is on the east coast somewhere . 
real attractive young girl . 
college freshman , college coed . 
i think she is a freshman . 
she had been dating a fellow for several 
they went back to her dorm room 
and date rape . 
i mean , and it just , 
she looked anguished . 
i mean , it was really just sad . 
i mean , did not pick it up and read it , 
but i should have . 
i know .
i mean , i do not , 
you can't trust anybody . 
i do not have any , uh , cure , 
it is really scary . 
you really can't . 
i mean , we lease out a really nice two story town home in north dallas . 
and they have a real big thing here . 
people , i mean , even dry cleaners knock on the door and are soliciting , 
everybody wants your business kind of thing . 
and my husband is the kind of guy , he's sometime , 
he was raised on a farm in southern ohio , near dayton . 
and i think sometimes it is just , he and i are very different in terms of that . 
i mean , i basically have started not to trust 
and , uh , he opened the door . 
i came downstairs 
and i was real upset 
and i probably got more nasty than i should have . 
you know , 
i would not , i mean , 
well , you , 
oh , yeah . 
and it is not a reason . 
i mean , i have been to new york . 
you should not deny yourself going to visit 
uh , but it is not any worse . 
i used to work for a mortgage company that was owned by , uh , 
are you from boston ? 
home owners savings and loan in boston . 
and i know i never felt , 
i mean , i have been to downtown new york city 
and i have been to downtown boston . 
and i never felt any safer on milk street in boston , staying at the meridian , 
i did not pay for . 
but , i mean , i never felt any safer there than i did in any other city 
so i would say one thing . 
do not deny yourself the new york experience , but go with people that you know . 
i would not want to go by myself . 
no , uh . 
but i mean , yeah , i do not know . 
i mean , i guess i could go on and on about what to do about criminals . uh , 
i think the handgun , 
i am not real big on guns 
i think our 
i mean , 
uh , are the new york , 
i do not know how the new york state prison system 
that is a way to put it , 
they are booked up . 
are they paroling , uh , like murderers 
and , i mean , here it is just a real big deal . 
they parole people that have killed police officers 
and then they are out doing it again . 
right , um , 
i do not know . because i am not real up on 
but , you know , you just 
it is a lot of repeat crime . 
they should have been in there longer . 
i know . 
and then you think , i mean , i mean , i can remember , i have not been out of school that long , 
but it has been at least ten years . 
or is it just , 
i think that , like you said , television ? 
is it just that more people think there is like excitement in it , you know ? 
i mean , people that may have been close to the edge just go over because they see something or read something . 
it seems like a lot of , i , 
that it is more , like in boston , 
there was a case of , uh , a couple of kids , fifteen year olds . 
they wanted to see what it was like to kill someone . 
so they picked on this 
and it like , 
oh , god . 
ugh , that is horrible . 
how can you even think like that ? 
yeah , isn't it something ? 
i am originally from pittsburgh , pennsylvania , 
and i have a niece and nephew . 
and i just , uh , i mean 
you know , it is just , i think kids get too 
in atlanta , where my inlaws live , uh , they had that thing , you know , the high top sneakers ,
kids killing each other and beating their brains out . 
oh , for the sneakers . 
or the jackets , the team like the raiders 
you know , stealing the hundred dollar jackets . 
uh , i mean , it is i guess , it goes from the most petty like that to like what you were saying that in boston . 
that is crime where they videoed . 
that is probably one of the most 
where they videotape themselves . 
it seems like crime is turning into a pastime instead of like , you know , be  . . . 
um , what do you think the major cause of air pollution or at least in the boston areas , 
well , the major cause it seems up here is exc , 
i live right on the ocean 
so it's kind of hard for me to tell what would happen if i lived in some of the valleys inland , 
but the major cause here , and we always seem to , and it seems to be validated by the press , is the car pollution . 
we don't have too much industrial pollution . 
uh , car pollution seems to be the one and only thing that i can really put my finger on here . 
um , that isn't the same in the washington area because we don't have any major , um , industry except for , uh , government and services . 
and is absolutely awful . 
um , also the hub of three airports 
in this general area there is , uh , national , dulles , and then , uh , baltimore , washington . 
and it , 
interestingly some of the information i've been reading indicates that the amount of air pollution from , uh , uh , airplanes is extraordinary . 
is that so ? 
i didn't know that . 
and that's  always  something that , you know , you don't think about . 
well , most people talk about the noise pollution from airplanes rather than the air pollution . 
but the , uh , 
apparently the air pollution and the fact that it's delivered right up in high altitudes 
i would think so . 
you know , uh , i guess it talked about all types of pollution . 
i happen to that come to note . 
one , is that the carbon fluorides that are , uh , being released into the atmosphere are causing even a larger hole in the southern hemisphere in the ozone layer 
and again 
and now they've located rather an expanding one in the northern hemisphere . 
so car , 
so i'm quite concerned . 
i don't think it's involved any longer with , uh , hair sprays or those th , 
i think uh , from what i understand it's air conditioning units 
i know in florida there's no place you go that isn't air conditioned , 
and i do quite a bit of business in washington . 
i mean you know what it's like here . 
oh , yeah , 
it's quite , 
is the un , 
it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned . 
and i guess refrigerators , 
we just had the , 
they release that . 
that's right . 
so , solutions to this ,
you know , improved . 
well , i guess to me the first thing is i wish society would get as upset about this as you do get , getting people upset about animal rights . 
i mean this is so basic . 
it's human rights in the sense , 
but , uh , in terms of demanding , it's just not caused 
but demanding that , uh , we can spend so much money on certain things but that research really be directed toward , um , improvement of polluting vehicles , and not just cars but also buses , um , planes . that something can be done . i me , i can't imagine that  well   , 
well , i th , 
if we can't send people to the moon ,
i think that it can be done simply because , uh , uh , we've , 
every car now in america that's been produced for the past fifteen years has what they call a catalytic converter . 
converter , 
and no lead gas came to the pumps . 
 and that's been done . 
there's the lead pollution that problem , essentially i guess because it was at crisis proportions was , 
and i think that there are solutions , 
and that   for buses , 
certainly we don't even need a research anymore . 
it's just a matter of passing the law , 
and passing the law depends on how heavy the automobile lobby is . 
that's right . 
well , and also to make it economically feasible .
that's right . 
i don't know if you ever got caught in a traffic jam behind a bus , 
oh , yeah , well , 
that , you know , 
the smell is awful 
but , you know , i was reading the other day not to go on with this but that ,
so , i guess you're .
but even , of course , in the longer term just to get away from fossil fuels . 
i mean , i'm thinking of research in that direction rather than 
we've taken the intermediate step 
but i don't think ,
well , we , you know 
up here in new england , uh , where i've , 
right close to where i live is the  seabrook  nucleus site which is ,
i me , 
uh , my daughters marched uh , uh , against the  seabrook  
and i kind of , uh , 
my feelings were that we needed this bridge to , 
you don't throw the baby out with the bath water ,
unfortunately though i think the oil companies have lied to us for years .
so we really don't know whether there's enough fossil fuel left 
or there isn't , 
 uh , and , uh , 
but with the pollution issue , uh , fossil fuel is not the way to go anyway . 
uh , so you've got to look elsewhere . 
uh , but it is something that's a little frightening 
and in fact , well , i , 
within our family we have said , 
my husband , 
i have two sons , uh , well , 
one is already in college in new england , 
and the other will be going in september , 
and we just feel that when we leave , uh , this area , we're going north , not south . 
uh , i like the mentality north , 
and i also like the fresher air up there . 
that's right . 
so , i mean that's the way we will be going . 
their attitudes are . 
well , in that ranking order , the worst pollutants in america . 
i mean , i read that the other day . 
i mean it was amazing 
but it's the industrial pollution i should imagine . 
and california seems to be taking steps , 
i mean , the  fairly   , 
the smog and , 
but , uh , again , uh , that didn't occur without a crisis . 
nothing will occur , i guess , without a crisis . 
i mean ,  even  california was notorious for its smog years ago , 
well , the greatest thing that happened to pollution in the last couple of years as far as i'm concerned , is the no smoking rules ,
and it really is a pleasure for me , although , i guess smokers don't think that . 
 but that , 
 well , that's , 
that was its most personal , 
well , definitely advance that . 
well , listen i enjoyed speaking with you . 
and let's hope there are other people that feel the same way .
  something happen . 
right on , 
thank you . 
you're welcome . 
uh , national health insurance , i think , is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive . 
because , uh , the articles that i've read regarding national health service in canada and england has indicated that , uh , 
what i , 
stay in line for , uh , four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor . 
i'm sort of mixed on this . 
i think that uh , not in so much a , uh , national kind of medical thing that li , like england has but more of a , um , national insurance , uh , sort of clearinghouse or whatever . 
i think that , uh , too many , uh , 
the problem that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through 
you mentioned canada . 
i think that they have a system where , uh , with , 
i mean , particular , 
um , i see . 
and that way one centralized thing . 
well , i think that , uh , again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own ,
uh , i was listening , uh , on the radio the other day 
and they were talking that , something like this , 
i think they were talking about the fact that , um , the money that could be saved , um , in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider , um , uh , could , 
they could make it , to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save . 
 uh , we're currently , where i'm working now , under blue cross . 
i don't know what the total cost of the program is 
but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a month or something like that . 
so i assume that probably the total cost is probably ,
they're probably picking up about half of it . 
and that's a pretty good policy , 
but if you had something like one of these , uh , 
h m o . 
and they're fairly expensive . 
i was on an h m o , uh , up until last year 
and it was , 
i forget how much i paid a month 
but it you know , is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care . 
and , uh , the reason uh , not because i didn't like it , 
i really kind of did . 
uh , the reason i quite was just because enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that h m o 
so to stay with that doctor , 
so , we went here at work , 
and , uh , uh , even though you're , 
once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem . 
but , you know , if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference .
that's right . 
and then , we did find several good doctors . 
and , um , like you say it's , uh , five dollars an office visit . 
and , um , my wife was in the hospital had our daughter 
and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars 
oh , goodness . 
delivery room and everything . 
including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay 
but that cost 
it's really nice because in a , h m o , you know , 
they're trying to prevent a problem by keeping the cost down at the front end ,
they charge five dollars 
you're more willing to go in and try ,
as to a company's benefit ,
 because they don't have to worry about going in and paying ,
 that's a , 
i really liked it . 
my wife and i both did . 
of whatever . 
you just pay the five dollars right then 
and then you're done with it . 
but here again the doctor's practices in hospitals ,
uh , you take a hospital , uh , the physical plant itself , 
you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building , uh , when the rooms are empty . 
so , they spread the costs out over , uh , all the patient costs 
and , uh , that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that .
well , you know , they're also p , 
they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay . 
you know , just have to be there and can't afford it 
and so they know they're not going to get pa , 
so they ,
my daughter and soninlaw had a baby ,
he'll be three in august . 
and , uh , their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital . 
and like she went in , 
she had the baby 
and she was out in two days time . 
and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital , 
the deductibles didn't apply . 
and so that's one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by , uh , 
if you'll shorten your stay then we will , uh , waive the deductible . 
uh , is doing something similar where they're also going to mor , 
so what movies have you seen lately ? 
well , lately i've seen soap dish . 
which was a , 
and that was a lot of fun . 
it was kind of a silly little film about soap operas and things . 
well , see that's something i want to see , 
that's on my list to see . 
it was okay . 
it was um , not a wonderful film 
but it was cute but not the biggest laugh i've seen . 
oh , okay . 
i saw thelma and louise .
oh , did you ? 
actually i saw it twice because i liked it so much . 
see that's also on my list . 
and it's really disturbing but a good movie . 
a disturbing movie , 
how do you mean ? 
well , it was , 
um , let's see . 
the , um , 
it's different , 
you know , shoot 'em up kind of film . 
but it's with women in it instead of men 
so that's kind of a 
a switcheroo , huh ? 
and it made me think a lot about , you know , 
you would applaud bruce willis in die hard if he was doing this 
but you might not be so 
when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it , 
so , that was kind of interesting . 
but i really enjoyed it . 
so , i w , 
because that just reminds me of , you know , like back in school 
and , you know , the girlfriends just taking off for a day or something .
that's kind of what it was . 
um , yeah . 
they had started out with that , 
then they got into lots of trouble . 
before we found the shopping malls that's what we did . 
well , i'll have to keep that on my list then . 
i also saw that madonna movie . 
it's truth or dare 
and that was pretty scandalous . 
scandalous ? 
i can imagine . 
and so it was interesting .
i guess she does it for the social value of showing you what trash is , huh ? 
well , i think she kept saying that , uh , 
they talked about her , 
all around the world . 
and they were all   to her at the vatican city and wouldn't let her perform in rome , 
and she ,
it had a social message to it 
you just had to find it . 
you had to wade through it and find it .
we never quite believed that , 
you never quite got to , 
i thought that was pushing it a little bit 
but , she    , 
all i know about that woman is that she's an incredible  marketeer  .
she is . 
she's rich .
and she , 
  she's smart at what she does . 
she knows how to do that . 
what did you think about dances with wolves when you saw it ? 
well , okay , 
see , we're getting back to last year . 
that's probably the last movie i saw . um , dances with wolves , 
i just adored it . 
how can i tell you . 
um , a couple years ago , i guess , well , maybe ten years ago i had read  bury my heart at wounded knee  
i mean i really liked it a lot . 
i mean it was a real consciousness raiser , i guess . 
um , and i only bring up  wounded knee  because that was what ten years ago you read indian population , 
and then everything went away for a couple years , 
and now it's back again . 
and , you know , it's sort of a popular view of , um , what happened way back then . 
of course , no one will ever know . 
really i don't kn , 
i know , 
i was , 
i wondered if , uh , the evil tribe , if they were really as bad as it made them to be . 
well , who knows . 
i mean it sort of showed like two different types of tribes 
like one was a warring tribe , 
and the other one was , uh , vegetarian kind of , you know , feel good tribe .
so there possibly were because you know you always have conflict in the world . 
nobody can get along peacefully .
but i wonder 
i thought the , 
because they made a big deal about how this indian tribe 
and you know , that was so wonderful that they done that 
and uh , uh , i wonder how the ancestors of this warlike tribe if they were offended by the film , 
oh , i see . 
if it , 
you know , you didn't ,
i thought it was a very interesting movie . 
well , i think so . 
 uh , you know , what went on here , 
but who knows how it's supposed to all end .
you know it had a much bigger thing i thin , 
meaning to me 
i think about , you know , just the meaning of , um , the freedom of this country and what that really meant . 
and that was taking over somebody else's freedoms .
it meant something bigger i think . 
but still it was a fantas , 
i loved the buffalo scene . 
and i thought kevin costner was just , 
i got a little sick of his mug on the screen every ,
i know the  , 
but he's the director , you know . 
um , but , yeah , 
i just thought it was a really interesting , intense film . 
well , that's good . 
intense i think is the word for it because three hours went by really fast . 
it was good . 
i looked at my watch only a few times ,
ate a lot of popcorn . 
but it put me in a really bad mood , 
i don't know why . 
did it really ? 
we di , 
we were just all really grouchy when it was over . 
so we decided that may be the mark of a good film . 
it made us think . 
and so , 
it made you think . 
we were grouchy . 
we felt guilty for being , 
well , maybe that was , um , 
but there are no answers , you know . 
i know 
and we had  , nothing to do with it . 
that can make you crabby , yes . 
we were not responsible , 
but we still felt the thick blame for ,
that's true . 
we could have , 
but it's , 
they sort of candy coated the western story for many years , 
and , um , you know , when the truth , oh , well , 
it always balances out one way or the other 
i do . 
i'm just out of school 
so i've seen ,
oh , okay . 
don't have a job 
so i  shouldn't  go see movies all the time . 
oh , there you go .
um , i rented a good movie , um , called cinema  paradeso  
it was just ,
it's , uh , story about a little boy in a little italian village , 
and he , um , owns a , um , 
or he works in it helps the projectionist . 
there's oh , an old man who's the projectionist 
and he befriends this old man , 
and then it just tells about their friendship that lasts through all these years . 
and it's just , 
i mean , if you don't mind reading subtitles , 
i thought i had to kind of get beyond that . 
those little , you know , 
reading the little words at the bottom of the screen 
but , um , oh , i just laughed and cried 
oh , i'll have to write that down . 
that was a great one . 
and other than that i , 
i'll have to write that , 
did you see texasville ? 
are you into ,
i had read , um , the last picture show 
 but that's out on video now 
and i haven't seen it . 
but i was interested in reading texasville before i saw the movie . 
did you like it ? 
um , i read a lot of larry mcmurtry books 
 and texasville is just like that . 
it's like very peculiar circumstances 
it's , you know , 
and it's just sort of a , 
do you have annual family reunions 
uh , yeah , 
uh , our , 
and , uh , they , uh , for as long as i can remember , have had , uh , a yearly reunion , um , 
back , uh , early on they used to different people's houses ,
all local . 
were they like all in dallas ? 
uh , no , 
it was around there generally . 
uh , that's where the family 
just from city to city then   .
so . uh , it was a big deal , 
but , uh , they tried to centralize it in one spot . 
so , in the past couple of years they had it at a state park every year . 
we rent a pavilion and do that 
and that's usually works out to be pretty good . 
and , uh , they will rent a pavilion on a weekend , 
and uh  , 
do you go back ? 
in fact , uh , this past sunday was the reunion , 
but i did not get to go . 
uh , i have , 
uh , just , uh , the distance involved 
uh , just not , 
i have a younger daughter now 
and , uh , i , 
it's kind of hard to get her there ,
but i am going my mother's side , has not seen , you know , my daughter , 
do you have brothers and sisters ? 
i have one brother , 
and , is your mother still living ? 
oh , so you go back and visit with her anyway . 
would you not ? 
so that's no  big  thing . 
but , uh , i do enjoy the reunions . 
the only problem is that now , uh , originally when we had them , uh , they were mainly  , 
uh , father's . 
my mother's father's family had quite a few ,
so , it was a large reunion of that group , uh , from that descendants . 
and , uh , a lot of those people have , 
and at time , you know , they all knew one another . 
and now it has gotten , uh , that , uh , a lot of those people uh , have died off , 
or , you know , what we are left with is of , 
the next generation , 
and so , uh , it's not quite as close as it used to be . 
so , i think people feel less of a desire to really go . 
i know that , 
why do you think that it's less close than it used to be ? 
well , uh , you know , at that ti , 
when they were a , 
you know , those were all brothers and sisters a lot 
geographical location . 
you know , back around , you know , in the twenties and thirties when they were growing up , uh , you know , they were all located together ,
and i mean when time went on the family grew and moved away and so forth . 
and now you know , 
like say the kids of those people who are not , you know , anywhere near one another and i do not think they feel the closeness that they used to be there .
but that's just how it is . 
my mother was complaining last year about th , you know , 
it's dwindling down every year , 
you know , i think 
is that family's lack of priority , anymore , maybe  yes   , 
we get so involved in our work lives and just ,
well , yeah . 
that's , uh , 
i think that's some of it . 
but , you know , i have , 
uh , i , 
it's just the way , you know , i think society is now , is that we do not have the extensive family we used to . 
it's more of smaller unit , 
and you know , we tend to try to do things , i think with our immediate family ,
uh  , 
  it really makes an effort to ,
it requires a lot of effort to , 
i mean , i used to enjoy going , 
i mean i still do kind of enjoy it , 
but , uh , really enjoy seeing . 
you know , i , 
it's going just for the sake of getting together , 
i think for the family . 
do you correspond with anybody other than your mother and brother that's in that group ?
um , um , no , 
in that , 
but , then again , uh , well , i do . 
that's about th , 
my mother's sisters ,
but i feel closer to them , because i kind of grew up with them . 
uh , you know , and generally when i was growing up a lot of those people , the only time i ever saw them was at the reunion , 
so , uh 
you do not really feel that really close to them . 
in my , uh , father's family , we get together every year at a different location , either dallas or oklahoma city . 
they had chosen santa barbara , california for this summer and did not get enough people that were willing to go that far ,
and , uh , so they cancelled that one and , uh , are looking next year bringing it back closer , 
but we have a family letter , 
and it usually goes through me twice a year 
and what you do is take out the last letter you wrote that's on the bottom and put your new letter on the top , 
and then that's the way it's kept in order . 
and then , about twice a year then you are kept up with what is going on and when you meet them at the reunion , you do not feel like , i do not know anything about this person . 
you have ,
that's a good idea . 
so , you are kind of ,
 and that , 
we tried to start that in my husband's family . 
his mother's side decided they were going to have a reunion a couple of years ago , 
and it just never   
my husband's sisters started it and sent it to us 
and that's as far as it got . 
i sent it ,
 but we are going in a couple of weeks to the next one , in scottsdale , arizona ,
we are real glad we got together because since one sister and one sisterinlaw of the original family left . 
and the sisterinlaw died 
and the sister is in a nursing home , 
so , we are glad that we took that opportunity two years ago . 
uh , well , since i initiated the call , i guess i'll start off first . 
uh , number one , i have absolutely no problem with random testing . uh , 
i spend an awful lot of time traveling on the job 
and i feel , i would be very comfortable if they would do drug testing for , particularly airline pilots and such . 
i'd feel much more comfortable than i do now , based on what i've been hearing in the newspapers . 
so i really don't have a problem with it . 
yeah . uh , 
i don't either . 
 uh , i've never , 
i don't work , at home right now . 
i stay home with my children . 
uh , but my husband works 
and they do have that at his place of employment 
and neither of us have a problem with it . 
we've , particularly , like you said with the things that the airlines and such . 
 uh , it's a scary thing to know that , uh , you just don't know what people are doing 
so , and the advertisements on television lately have been so , uh , 
there have been so many . you know , 
there's , uh 
just about 
like that 
i feel like , 
probably just for our own safety when we're traveling and things that would be something i'd like to know that's going on . 
 well , i happen to be , uh , 
my job is i'm supervisor of personnel safety for the world's largest paint company , 
so i , 
it's very near and dear to me when we start talking about drug testing for random sampling and testing for cause , this type of thing . 
and even in our field we have people that are in very high risk jobs 
and we , at the present time , do not have random testing . 
and i am pushing towards that . 
i honestly feel if people have nothing to hide , they shouldn't have a problem with it . 
and if they are trying to hide something , then i have to know that , because we're talking major liabilities . 
not only with themselves , but with other employees . 
and i really , you know , 
much prefer having doctors and airline pilots tested 
i have a real fear , 
but that at some point something's going to happen . 
and they're showing it with aids , 
so why , you know , 
they ought to start doing something with the drugs .
so i really have no problem with it . 
well , it's unfortunate , i think , that everyone doesn't have that opinion . 
uh , uh , i've heard some people just talking in our group of friends that they just feel it's an invasion of privacy and things like that , 
but , uh , in the long run , it seems to me , it's kind of like what they keep talking about uh , the aids testing with doctors or dentists and things 
they feel that's not fair and whatever , 
but , you know , those kind of things i'd like to know 
it wouldn't be , 
in my opinion , 
i've had a lot of dental work done , 
and the last dentist didn't even use gloves at all , 
oh , really ? 
that kind of , 
well , that scares me because if that's the way they are , 
if i were a dentist , i'd want to be protected , too . 
well , you would think so . 
that is , because , well , 
and i worked for a dentist 
and that's , uh , you know , 
of blood and things like that 
and it's real , real dangerous . 
i would think , 
but , with all the accidents , just with , uh , everything happening with , 
airlines just drive me crazy . 
people are afraid to fly now .
i don't know . 
well , i do know texas instruments has random drug testing . 
and i think they've had it for several years . 
and their program they had , i don't think had a lot of , uh , problems associated with it , 
but , uh , my brotherinlaw happens to work there 
and it sounded very positive . 
and i think it's great . 
i would encourage it . 
i'm pushing our company towards that .   .
well , and , you know , if they do find someone who is , uh , having a problem with drugs 
and they can get them the help that they need .
because a lot of people , seems like , obviously are trying to hide that 
and too many people are just dying .
i don't know what the crime is like where you are , 
but the crime rate here is just astronomical . 
ours is changing . 
it's increasing . 
i live in a very nice suburb 
and the selling of drugs . 
it's just too loose . 
it's too free . 
i just got a piece of paper the other day , uh , that now they have these , 
i have two very little children , under two 
 and i got a piece of paper from my husband's office , 
it's talking about these , uh , drug tattoos now 
it looks like a sticker 
and it's for kid , 
um , how do you like it ? 
i'm from , uh , colorado originally 
and there are no bugs there . 
and i didn't mind getting in the dirt there , 
once i see these bugs around here , i'm just kind of out of it . 
oh , what kind do you have ? .
oh , roaches and , 
do they really ? 
oh , yes . 
just awful . 
so i , 
oh , and i know somebody that lives there , 
and they never mentioned that problem .
oh , you're kidding . 
it's a d , 
well , maybe they didn't mention it because it's just kind of a fact of life around here . 
and , uh , 
oh , my . 
they probably just take it for granted then . 
it must be . 
it doesn't matter . 
they make good fertilizer in the garden . 
oh ,  yuck  .
me , personally can't , 
  i don't have that problem , uh , 
mine is mainly 
and so i get into the gardening part of it , the fun part ,
but i don't like it dirty .
 you know i have to say that's not .
i don't know . 
two bits i'll get a man to talk to me ,
but although i do know a lot of my friends do like all the gardening work . 
and this year we put in a new lawn in a new home 
so , um , 
today we just had a lot of rain .
 oh , really ? 
i don't know how yours has been . 
well , it's been real hot here lately . 
i mean we've had to actually have the airconditioning on and everything 
but , uh , doe , 
it's supposed to rain again now , uh , this weekend . 
oh , i see . 
 so , then , 
well , we're leaving tomorrow 
and we're going down to new orleans 
and from ohio since we're right near lake erie 
this is going to be a switch for us for a week 
and i think we'll probably experience some of your weather although i think they have more humidity . 
but , um , 
do you like it at all ? 
i mean it's just , here 
i just can't stand to even get out uh , in the dirt .
well , how about when you were in colorado ? 
well , i liked it a little bit 
but i didn't , uh , 
i was working at that time fulltime and didn't have a lot of time ,
and so that i think really , um , hampered it a little bit . 
well , and then , too , now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly . my water bill was high . 
and , uh , if you have that on a regular basis in texas , i think i would go with something very dry to keep it off , you know . 
 uh , and with children , um , you probably don't have time anyhow 
it's so , uh , okay , very good . 
sounds like i , 
afraid not . 
nice talking to you . 
so you said that you live in coppell . 
so what is your house like ? 
it's a two bedroom , two baths duplex . 
oh , well that's neat , 
well , our side .
well that's kind of neat that you can 
that's good . 
do you have any children ? 
do you ? 
and our home is really too small for us right now .
ours is , too . 
we outgrew it when we moved in . 
we moved from an apartment 
and at the time we just had a little baby that was five months old 
 so we moved into this house in garland , 
it's in one of the older areas of town 
 and one thing i really like is it has big trees everywhere 
 you know , lots of shade and squirrels and birds and 
but the house is real small 
it has less than a thousand square feet 
oh , wow . 
it's real little . 
and now i have a daughter , 
now my , 
the one that was five months old is seven years old 
 and i have another one that's three and a half 
how many bedrooms is it ? 
 but the room that's built on doesn't have a closet 
 so , um , the people that lived here before us did use it for a bedroom 
 but we have always just put like our computer and extra toys and books and 
 you know , it's kind of a catch all room .
but it sure is nice to have it 
they all go out there to play with the barbies 
how fun . 
that works out good . 
and i'm thankful i have two girls , because they're in bunk beds , 
and how old's the youngest ? 
she's three and a half 
so , um , and right now we have their clothes on , uh , like double racks , you know , in the closet 
we made a higher and a lower 
 and it works out fine , 
but they're just about to get too tall  ,
and , um , we're going to have to figure out a new idea . 
but we're kind of looking around and wanting to move into a bigger home 
 so that would be nice . 
that's what we'd like to do . 
is coppell a nice area to live ? 
and they , 
i don't have any kids , 
so i don't really know , 
but they say that we have wonderful schools . 
well , i think i've heard a lot , uh , about coppell schools , that they're real good 
that's neat . 
do you hope to have children , 
or are you not planning on having any , 
i see . 
well , do you have any pets ? 
oh , yeah . 
i have two dogs . 
well , do they stay inside , 
well , that's neat . 
they're my babies . 
well , what are the colors in your house ? 
uh , um , kind of a mauve and gray . 
oh , i bet that's pretty . 
i'm a cow nut .
oh , that's neat . 
i like cows , too . 
 well , our house was redo , uh , 
our house is very old also 
it's like thirtyseven years old 
and it was redone before we moved in , which , 
i'm thankful for that , 
but the , 
it was redone at the time probably when earth tones were in 
everything is 
 like , the carpet's kind of a tan and brown 
 but the good thing is you can bring out other colors from that 
oh , yeah , 
 you know , so , uh , that's worked out good . 
in the kitchen they put real pretty blue and tan , um , wallpaper 
so that's nice , 
oh , sounds pretty . 
we've enjoyed living here . 
it's close to my , uh , oldest daughter's school 
 and that makes it really handy , too 
 and she really likes her school , 
 and we are so close to shopping 
and  . . . 
how about in coppell ? 
i've always imagined it kind of away from everything . 
well , you know , now we have that new mall in lewisville 
oh , really , 
 and that's just like a mile or two from our house 
oh , well , that's nice . 
 but , when we first moved to coppell , it's what , six years ago , we didn't even have a grocery store 
oh , wow , 
 and now we have four 
 and coppell's not really big enough to support four grocery stores 
 but it does sound like it's definitely growing . 
oh , much 
in fact , it's about the size now , 
i moved down here from chicago , what , twentythree years ago 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and coppell's now about the size that lewisville was when , when i moved down here . 
oh , i see . 
well , when we first moved here , we moved here from lubbock 
 and we almost moved to lewisville , 
that was 
oh really , 
at the time we thought we might buy a mobile home , 
so do you have an opinion on credit cards ? 
you do ? 
what do you think about them ? 
i think they get a lot of people in trouble . 
i have one right now 
and , um , i just got it about six months ago 
 and i find that it makes it a lot easier to get things that you generally wouldn't get .
and then you don't stop to realize that , you know , 
you charge this for twenty , charge that for twenty , charge this for twenty , 
and pretty soon you owe a hundred dollars 
and you don't stop to think about it . 
i got in trouble when i was in the service quite a few years ago like ten to fifteen thousand dollars in trouble . 
oh , my goodness . 
you know , so i eventually got it all paid . 
now i carry one . 
i have a gas card and a visa card . 
and i never use them unless i need to .
that's good . 
i made a rule with myself when i got one that if i couldn't pay it in full every month that i'd have to rip it up , 
and interest rates aren't none too shallow these days anyway . 
but i know a lot of people that get in trouble with them especially , you know 
we have , 
i'm in lubbock 
and we have a bunch of college kids around here going to tech , 
and they seem to get in trouble with them a lot . 
i have a couple friends too that have about three of them maxed out .
and they 
 hers is up to nine hundred dollars 
and she only earns like two hundred dollars a month because she's going to school . 
like monthly fee like twen , 
 i guess you have to pay like twenty dollars each month is the 
something like that . 
 so all she's paying is interest on hers every month . 
it just seems crazy to me 
well , my wife got in trouble one time with hers . 
she was making like , i don't know what she was making , fortyfive dollars a month i think . 
and fifteen dollars of it was because she was over the limit 
and fifteen dollars of it was interest 
so she was only paying in it fifteen dollars a month . 
 so and that was before we got married , 
but it's , 
you know , we sat down and talked about it and discussed it 
and it's come out pretty good . 
now we have a eighteen year old that's fixing to get out of high school and go to college . 
oh , really ? 
that's the first thing he wanted . 
was a visa card ? 
 oh , my goodness . 
i bet . 
 you know , so . 
i don't know . 
i'm about sick of mine right now . 
i don't , 
but i think they're too readily accessible 
 and there's too many companies out there that are willing to give them to you and get you trapped . 
i mean you can always file bankruptcy to get out of it , 
but that's a lot of pain and hassle . 
in the olden days when my parents were growing up and we couldn't afford everything , we didn't have such things as credit cards . 
we just waited until time come around that we could afford it . 
and you know , we had all the necessities , 
so . nd i very seldom use a credit card on necessities . 
i always use it for something i want not something i need . 
my parents are really good about not using credit cards . 
they are against it .
i don't think they like the fact that i have one either . 
i think if a home mortgage loan or something like that where you have to , you know , be able to prove that you can afford this and the rest of your bills , we probably wouldn't have the problems we have . 
of course , we wouldn't have the retail market we have either 
so i guess they trade one for the other . 
i disagree with it , 
but they still trade one for the other . 
well , that's good . 
it sounds like you kind of got your head together in the credit department for , 
you sound pretty young , 
i'm twenty right now . 
are you ? 
so , just going to school and working 
all right . 
it does kind of get in the , 
when you want something that , 
like last weekend was homecoming 
and i needed 
so i just went out and bought them 
i didn't really have the money to do it 
it's pretty easy .
it sure is . 
so do you just have two kids 
uh , we have a eighteen year old , seventeen year old , and a seven year old . 
oh , really ? 
i'm from plano , texas . 
oh , are you ? 
but right now i'm out in provo , utah going to b y u 
you're a mormon then ? 
what's that ? 
oh , yeah . 
oh , really ? 
oh , yeah . 
well , uh , and that's an idea that's been kicked around for a long time . 
i don't know that it's ever been seriously considered , uh , as far as close to passing , uh , any legislation or anything like that . 
but , uh , i believe israel does that , don't they for their , 
uh , yes , 
i think so . uh , 
wel , everybody has to do something . 
i don't kn , 
or maybe theirs is , in fact , one year of military service for everyone . 
but , uh , 
i believe that's right . 
 uh , and i don't know that that's really what we're talking about . 
i don't think n , 
i think of that . 
it couldn't be . 
military service is not that much 
but , the , military used to do it 
but the idea that , uh , there are things that do need to be done that could be done 
and then , uh , country would benefit from one year the , uh , 
well , now that's a thought . 
uh , you know , um , it could even be done while they're doing another job , 
but , uh , it's , uh , you know , such a grassroots idea that it , 
i think the family would have to be involved in it . 
and people would have to be convinced that , you know , 
the basic message is that giving is better than receiving .
and that's not the kind of society we have right now . 
oh , yeah , 
i'm afraid you're right there . 
 uh , but , uh , anything like this that came up whether it , 
it quickly would be significant industry in figuring out how to get around it where people , 
 there's  lots and lots of volunteer programs 
and , uh , 
 uh , you know it's not , uh , 
maybe it cou , uh , 
younger people feel like it's not open to them , 
i don't know . 
but it should be if it's not . 
uh , i suspect that they don't feel it's open to them 
it's just that they , uh , are more selfcentered if you will and not considering ,
it is kind of an introspective time of life . 
but uh 
and , uh , to , uh , some of those people . 
so at least that's a step in the right direction i guess . 
and , uh , now i don't know it di , 
not the way that the society these days is going , 
and to turn that around that everybody , 
it's really unfortunate because when you do , 
i do volunteer work for the american lung association . 
and i uh , gone to work for american heart and just recently for the leukemia society . 
and uh , than the people involved . 
uh , it's really a gift to yourself 
i think that's a really important lesson to learn . 
 uh , not really happy , you know . 
uh , it really is better to give then to receive . 
i agree with that , 
what has set it off or what 
but loss of perspective in terms , 
so , uh , what was the last car repair you had ? 
 and it was getting rusty . 
and the thing that they forgot to do was um , to also look at the hose , 
and i had gone about oh , two days with my new radiator flushed 
and the hose burst . 
so i was stranded out on the highway .
oh , no . 
did you crack the block or what ? 
but , uh , there seemed to be enough antifreeze you know , left to do that 
but it cost me all kind of money , you know , to have that repaired after they said they were going to , they had repaired it . 
so that was a horrible experience 
i see . 
you got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though . 
that can be pretty serious . 
i know . 
what about you ? 
oh , i guess it's been awhile for me . 
i'd sa , 
it's been about a year . 
i had uh , the water pump break on my car . 
i was traveling , uh , 
i was going on my way home from thanksgiving 
 and it broke like in the middle of nowhere . 
so , i had to get it towed and then fixed 
big pain . 
oh , oh , 
especially when you're out on the highway . 
that's where i was . 
luckily someone came by and gave me a ride . 
i know , well , you know , uh , living in dallas , 
you know we've got , uh , bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic 
and , uh , that was horrible . 
you know to have the , you know , 
your car is  fuming  
and everything . 
it's already a hundred degrees 
you don't need that too . 
but my car is getting old . 
see it's about six years old now , 
so is mine .
so i got it right out of college 
and so uh , it's starting to show the wear and tear now . 
i'm hoping mine gets me through . 
i got until may until i'm out . 
 so when i cross  that one i'll be okay . 
 uh , that was my graduation present to myself , 
oh , that's nice .
i know 
to wear 
so i've been thinking , especially now is a good time to buy a car . 
because uh , i don't know if i want to , you know , pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown . 
i don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is 
and it's not worth it .
that's true . 
i agree with you there . 
so i don't know , uh , 
because you know , tuned up and i don't know , replace some of the belts . 
and i was looking at the , uh , 
tires need to be replaced 
and so i was thinking just a lot of money 
might as well buy me a new car for that . 
i got new tires last winter too 
it's not worth it . 
well , you have to , in pennsylvania , boy , 
oh , really ? 
oh , okay . 
lot of snow and a lot of cold . 
well , especially don't you have what , a lot of salt on the ground ? 
you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance . 
so i've been pretty lucky there . 
 well , i think they get the new  zbart  stuff and everything to where you can , um , 
that's usually pretty good . 
you just rinse it off after the winter is over and 
and go like that so . 
i usually like to do most repairs on my own though . 
do you ? 
plus if something goes wrong , i know who to blame . 
well , i think i'm getting too old for all that . 
i had four brothers 
and they used to drag me out underneath the car , and stuff 
so i can do all that stuff 
but to go have it done now 
so i can get my hands dirty . 
so , yeah . 
i'm just getting to that age i guess . 
you just don't have , 
your time becomes very precious 
so working on the car is just not one of those things i want to spend my time on anymore .
more fun things to do . 
absolutely , absolutely . 
i'm trying to , you know , 
i just need one , 
i had two cars there for a while 
so i wouldn't have to worry about which car was going to run . 
well , that's nice . 
and yeah , 
 but it became a hassle trying to keep up and maintain both of them . 
and yeah , 
so that , 
one is bad enough .
but i think i got rid of the wrong one .
on this one 
so yeah , 
 uh , that was something else .
 put   , 
this must be a hard category . 
well , yeah , 
i guess . um , you know , 
unless you're , um , you know , big doityourselfer . um , to , you know , fix up your own cars and things like that . 
 but i guess they were talking about experiences . 
you know , uh , uh , i did , 
my parents live in ohio 
so you know , the really cold weather . 
and , uh , i've always lived down here in the south , 
and , oh , i took my car up there to their house 
and , um , i guess i had a crack in the block , 
and when i got up there the car , 
let's see , 
how old are you lisa ? 
i'm twenty . 
how old are you ? 
i'm older . 
older .
older than you are . 
okay , 
so i'm going , 
and where are you calling from ? 
i'm calling from , uh , provo , utah , 
but i'm from plano , texas . 
oh , you are from plano . 
my sister lives in plano . 
oh , really ? 
oh , wow . 
anyway , so , where's your favorite place to go ? 
my grandparents live there . 
that's generally our usual summer vacation . 
where in arizona ? 
uh , tempe . 
i've never been to tempe . 
that's where i'd like to go . 
what do you like about tempe ? 
uh , mainly just being with family is it . 
we just hang out 
and my grandparents have a pool 
so we go swimming 
and , uh , 
pretty hot isn't it , in the summer ? 
and it's fun to be with my cousins . 
they're up there also , my grandparents and 
that's good . 
been to hawaii ? 
have you ? 
i'm going to go for , uh , almost two weeks this winter . 
oh , my goodness . 
it's the longest , 
well actually i lived there , 
so i was there longer , 
but two weeks is the longest vacation i'll have ever taken there , 
around christmas time ? 
uh , no , 
we're going to go in march after my children's birthdays and get all that business out of the way . 
so i think , i would like to go to arizona . 
i mean , i was in phoenix last january 
but it was rainy and icky . 
oh , really ? 
it was the coldest it's been there ever in january  , 
i think . it's very cold . 
so , do you 
but , i would like to go to tempe . 
uh , some , yeah . 
i mean , i have been up until just a few months ago . 
but i'm thinking of going back to work .
but you definitely need to go to hawaii . 
very definitely . 
that's your favorite ? 
my husband hasn't been to europe yet 
and i'd like to take him there . 
 but he's traveled all over the united states 
and i haven't . 
like , i haven't been down south . 
i'd like to go to new orleans . 
have you been there ? 
where do you live ? 
i live in yakima , washington . 
so it's cold and rainy today . 
it's yucky . 
but we've had some pretty nice weather . 
we played tennis outdoors until last week , 
so do you go to school in provo , utah ? 
do you use nuskin skin care . 
they're located 
do you ? 
i'm a nuskin person . 
oh , really ? 
oh , my goodness . 
and best cus , 
not only and best 
but i'm my best customer . 
since we're not supposed to talk about this , though , is there anything more intensive for the eye area than the eye cream ? 
do you know ? 
i don't , 
maybe the rejuvenating cream is the only 
i have that , too . 
i'm fortytwo , 
i need something , 
i need more . 
than the intensive eye ? 
i didn't know if there was anything else . 
and i use the celltrex . 
but anyway , 
well , yes , 
nuskin is wonderful . 
i think it's a wonderful product . 
do you use it ? 
oh , my gosh . 
that's great . 
now i'm getting about sixty bucks a month , free products 
oh , yeah . 
i've worked there about a year . 
that's good . 
are they good to work for ? 
that's great . 
and you have not been to europe . 
do you go to school ? 
do you ski ? 
i ski , yes . 
you probably ski very well in utah . 
actually since i grew up in texas i've only been here about two years and 
why did you move to utah ? 
oh , you are going to school ?
is that where b y u is ? 
i know some people that went to b y u . 
that's great . 
pretty good . 
i do like to ski . 
so , where , have you skied ? 
and it's kind of nice being up here just because it's all like a vacation in itself when you get to go . 
if you like that kind of thing .
i am actually 
you're a junior . 
good for you . 
what are you studying ? 
good for you . 
you sound like a girl that has it together . 
i would just encourage you to do a little traveling , though , before you get married . 
because when you 
you think , 
i know . 
so just , you know , 
don't be in any hurry . 
i'm not . 
you really should go to europe . 
i went to europe for six weeks after i graduated from college 
and that was just , 
i mean i could have had that or a down payment on a new car 
and i took the trip . 
and it was great ? 
 uh , i traveled with a group of sixteen other students . 
actually there was two other graduating seniors besides myself , 
and we just had a ball . 
we stayed at , 
how long did you get to stay there ? 
uh , six weeks . 
oh , really ? 
so you should think about doing something like that . 
i just had a friend that got back from europe 
and she was there like all winter semester . 
well , uh , i , 
uh , i think it's 
statistics , obviously , vary greatly . 
i always thought of dallas as being a fairly safe place . 
well , it is , 
but our crimes up here , uh , as i think it must be in most cities now , 
but , uh , i was listening to the news the other day 
and they said they thought uh , so many people are without work nowadays , 
economy's so bad .
do you really believe that ? 
i mean , it's been up every year for many years 
that's a good point .
that's just what they quoted over the news . 
i don't know if i believe that or not , 
but , it does seem up 
what kind of newspaper do you get down there ? 
well , i think we got a pretty good newspaper . 
uh , we have two , the morning news and the , uh , times herald . 
morning news seems to have the largest circulation . 
i think it's a pretty good , 
it's a locally owned paper . 
the herald is owned , i think , by the times out of , uh , l a , or somewhere . 
do they play up the local crime angles 
 or do they , 
they don't play it up , i don't think . 
uh , but there is too much of it , you know , uh 
we had our , fact about , uh , 
last year sometime our home was broken into . 
so this is a topic of personal interest . 
we , uh , uh , 
but , so many in our neighborhood had been , 
and , uh , because we live on a corner 
but , uh , we were , so , uh , 
so you saw this happening in your neighborhood 
and you figured it wouldn't happen to you . 
sort of , yeah . 
and i never did get a security system , 
but since that happened , i certainly have . 
what kind of system do you have ? 
it's , uh , with you know , motion detector . 
well , is that a necessary feature to have somebody , you know , at the other end of the line 
or is it enough just to have a thing that makes loud noise ? 
i think , uh , the thing that makes a lot of noise would suffice . 
i really do . 
but , uh , this deal that was part of it for , you know , three years or so 
uh , but it , uh , 
the monitoring is not that bad , though 
because , uh , uh , we've goofed it up , you know , 
several times you'll hit the wrong key , not intentionally or something 
 , and they call back pretty quickly , 
so you know , i think it's all right . 
but i , 
to answer your question , uh 
whether it , 
so you got a sign up there that says you got this alarm system .
and what if a burglar comes along and cuts your phone line ? 
how does it do that ? 
who knows , you know . 
but that's a selling point . 
and supposedly pretty good . 
boy , they sure advertise so many of them nowadays . 
but , uh , well don't you all have a pretty high crime rate up there ? 
well , yeah , uh , 
i'm not saying it's any higher than anybody else's . 
down here , we seem to , 
 or not here , 
but the statistics seem to say that . 
i don't know . 
i think it's the murder capital of the country now . 
is that right ? 
i would gather probably from drugs . 
and i think that's the reason it's so high everywhere . 
but , i don't think there's anyplace , 
used to , 
but they do . 
we've had relatives that their children were just as involved in it , uh , as anyone , you know . 
so , what's the solution ? 
that's a good question . 
i don't know , 
i don't know what the solution is . 
i really don't . 
and all these politicians make hay over , you know 
and nothing seems to change . 
and , uh , i'm not sure that anything will because if something could happen to make these people not want to buy it 
 uh , but , they want to buy it , 
supply and demand . 
long as somebody wants to buy it , somebody going to provide it for them .
so , you know , i don't know what the solution is , 
i really don't .
i don't think anyone does , in fact . 
well , do you have a pet ? 
two cats , 
you're lucky . 
 your two fish . 
and what do you have ? 
well , my husband , 
you know , how , sometimes when you marry someone that you get along on everything except one major thing . 
oh , no . 
my husband is a hunter , fisherman , outdoorsman , marlboro type person who had to have a sporting dog . 
so we have a black labrador . 
beautiful , gorgeous black labrador , 
but to me , he belongs up you know , in the 
and then he goes out for the day . 
but this is a beautiful dog 
and he is wonderful with our little girls 
and he's , comes from a purebred line 
and there's nothing you could say bad about him , except that i was more of a cat or a small dog person 
and this is huge . 
you know , course , when he runs around the yard , he just digs , 
he doesn't know that he's tearing up things , 
but he does . 
and the worst part that i had with him , he's three now 
and i did not know what to expect from a dog having not had one , 
and i left him in the kitchen with the little baby gates up while i was gone for about an hour . 
and i came home 
and he had ripped my wallpaper off my wall . 
oh , my word . 
and it was in the floor 
and i just about lost it 
and i called 
oh , dear . 
and it was about eight months later , he ate a piece of the linoleum . 
he kept picking at it 
and i didn't kn , 
the tile in the kitchen and picked a hole in it .
so the last thing he did was , when i had sat out a whole lot of begonias in the backyard , he dug them all up and brought them to the porch . 
and i told my husband , 
and he looked at me like , well , you know 
he loves this dog 
and every night when he comes home from work , he hugs it and talks to him 
and he's a good dog , 
so it's one of those things i'm just having to get used to 
but , i grew up with cats 
and i'm very comfortable , 
i love my cats . 
i had one cat for eighteen years . 
i got her when i lived in hawaii . 
before i even got married i had my cat . 
she's old . 
well , i 
isn't she ? 
oh , i started to say 
then you broke your heart . 
 and she just sat there on my lap , you know . 
she just waited 
bless your heart . 
oh , it was awful . 
that makes me feel so bad . 
but her hair , 
but the bad thing was , though , she would pee in my husband's shoes . 
oh , no .
you know , and she just liked his shoes 
and he'd have these dress sh , 
oh , no .
oh , it was just bad . 
and my closet 
and it was , oh , something . 
oh , that's awful , 
i never heard of that before . 
oh , it was terrible . 
and once she did it , you know , then i mean , she wouldn't , 
if our shoes sat side by side , she would pee in my husband's shoes . 
she must have known he didn't like her or something . 
or the smell or something . 
oh , anyway , i , 
and i would bar the closet doors ,
 oh , dear , it was just awful . 
well , now , does 
that was very funny . 
they are house cats . 
uh , well , i have two cats right now . 
and , of course . 
oh , yeah , 
my fourteen year old son has an extra pillow on his bed 
see , it doesn't do anything . 
oh , no , i 
we've had two dogs 
and , uh , they both got ran over .
oh , no . 
were just my kids' friends , 
they would go with me when i would go running 
oh , no . 
it was awful . 
it was just , 
oh , that is . 
and it's too heartbreaking 
but they do dig up 
and they just wreck things 
and i'm not a 
they do wreck things . 
well , i'm not either . 
i'm not either 
and it's just been , 
i wouldn't want a lab . 
it sounds beautiful , 
he's beautiful 
but it's just one of those concessions ,
but i kind of ignore him . 
now today's the first cold we've had in texas 
and it's really cold and drizzly 
and it's freezing 
 and people are doing their fires 
and i brought him in because he's just a wet mess out there 
and he's in the laundry room with this little carpet square 
and then my daughters both have hamsters . 
and i , 
and how old are your girls ? .
they're eleven and eight 
and i 
oh , yeah . 
and they keep their cages real clean . 
it always smells of cedar 
and they just sleep and eat bits of apple and carrots and , 
somebody's trying to cut in on my line 
and i don't want to answer . 
oh , okay . 
i'll just wait . 
i've got incoming calls 
and i don't know why , body's calling . 
oh , okay . 
i hate to cut it off , 
i think 
i understand . 
so we'll just wait . 
whoever it is will call back . 
well , it's somebody calling for my kids , you know , 
i know . 
actually , it's my son , 
i know it is . 
my older boy . he never likes to come home from school . 
anyway that's what we have , 
and i've tried to start a fish tank 
how does , 
 and i keep 
in the salt water ? 
salt water or , 
they just raised our taxes up here about a year ago . 
well , they've , uh , statewide raises , 
they raise ours it seems like constantly . 
we just , uh , passed a new one , uh , 
fortunately or unfortunately it doesn't go into effect because we did not get the united airlines . 
oh , right 
and , uh , we had passed if they did locate here we would raise our taxes . 
but , uh , at least we thought we'd get something back from that . 
uh , how do you feel about taxes ? 
well , it seems like a big politics game 
like up here , last year , the governor was up for reelection 
so he said the budget was fine , 
the state didn't have any money 
and then right after he won the election he said we owed a lot of money 
so they raised all our taxes . 
and now it's election time again 
so they're trying to lower them . 
so they're just talk about lowering them 
but they never do , 
they just keep raising them . 
i've never seen taxes really go down . 
me neither . 
well , actually they're going to here because they didn't have a budget for so long 
so they raised the tax rate real high for the last three months of this year 
and they're going to lower it for next year . 
i guess they figure they're going to make up for all they didn't get when they should have had a budget . 
i hope they put that in writing .
they say they're going to lower , 
but i'll see . 
i feel like the middle class people are supporting the nation and , uh , that the rich are not paying their share 
and of course the poor can't afford it either , 
but , uh , i really feel like 
and i feel like , you know , 
i'm a middle class person income wise anyway 
and , uh , i get tired of supporting the whole country . 
so do i . 
i mean , i'm middle class barely , 
but , uh , i don't think the rich are paying not enough , 
i think they're paying too much . 
you think the rich are paying too much ? 
why bother working ? 
well , i don't know many rich that don't have enough tax breaks to , 
i mean , i'm talking about the really rich . 
well , they should just tax everybody the same amount no matter what you make . 
that would be fair . 
now i'll go along with that .
no loopholes or anything . 
everybody pays ten percent or fifteen or whatever . 
now , i think that would be fair . 
and i , you know , 
no ifs , ands and buts , you know , 
no big elaborate laws that uh , you know , call for a lot of enforcement or a lot of review . 
it's just , you know , you make this , you pay ten percent . 
if you make a hundred dollars , you pay ten percent , 
if you make a million dollars , you pay ten percent . 
that's the way our state tax is here . 
i think it's pretty fair . 
our state taxes are somewhat based on the federal . 
and , uh , they have not gotten it where the withholding is accurate . 
 and you withhold no matter what you do , 
they withhold what they're supposed to and at the end of the year it's not enough . 
oh , great , 
so you ought to be saving up some every month to make up for all what they should be taking out . 
but it's been that way for the last probably ten years . 
i guess you have to check yes 
or you come down to the end of the year 
and you don't have it to give it to them . 
unless you have a lot of deductions . 
but , you know , if you have a lot of federal deduction , it ends up hurting you state wise . 
and you end up owing , you know , 
you may get nine hundred dollars back from federal 
and you're going to owe fifteen hundred in state . 
and , uh , it's just ridiculous . 
but , i don't know . 
they just came up with a twentyfive percent increase on personal property in oklahoma county and that is a chunk . 
i'll say .
i mean twentyfive percent increase . 
uh , i guess , uh , i've always been kind of interested in , space and stuff . 
have you been following uh , the progress of the   space  health code   ? 
i haven't kept up as , uh , much as i would like , 
i've just been so busy , uh , 
i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then , 
i think it's pretty exciting that they can , uh , 
it would be interesting to see if they can find , uh , other planets that will be more habitable to , uh , you know , uh , humans 
and , uh , yeah , 
i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future you know , if it is at all possible . 
well , i wouldn't even mind , uh , being a pilot on one , 
or right now 
but i'm probably getting a little too old for that . 
 well , i know if they make the advances that they have been making , that , uh , maybe age or even physical , uh , abilities may not be , uh , a barrier anymore . 
well , they just made leaps and jumps . 
i think a lot of is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel , uh , uh , equipment and stuff that , 
i agree . uh , 
as a matter of fact we're the ones that i have been to houston you know , to visit the , uh , space center out there , 
and , uh , one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro 
 and , uh , that  vacuum   , uh , little space program was one of the big , you know , backers of that . 
it's amazing , you know , 
it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now . 
i don't know if you ever watch  gallagher   , you know , 
he's one of the comedians 
what would we do without it ? .
we were talking about that just the other day . 
what did we do without it back then ? 
i guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps . 
a lot of little things that have come  up  .
i know maybe some of the big things that , uh , uh , 
concentrated foods for one maybe 
i don , 
that's right . 
it's also just kept on going ? 
that's true . 
uh , i guess our minds are so , uh , uh , what is it ? uh , finite 
when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object ,
it's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely . 
uh , that is something that would be hard to think about . 
i agree . 
you know like you say we're used to finite things 
and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible . 
but , uh , yeah , 
i would like to see them , uh , do more in that area to make space travel more , uh , something that the ordinary person can , uh , enjoy . 
i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something . 
and i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like , you know , 
me too . 
i wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just , uh , get out there and just explore . 
i think , uh , it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't ,
i think that's what made us , uh , progress to the state we are is our curiosity . 
oh , sure . 
of course . 
that's true . 
there must be some better way of doing this . 
a better place to be or whatever , you know 
so you are always looking for something better . 
that's true . 
i know at work , uh , people always complain to me 
well , you are always whining 
there's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it . 
that's right . 
and if you are just content with being , you know , with the way things are then , you know , then you must lead a pretty dull life . 
 because if yo , 
well , they are always finding easier ways 
and , you know , just because they don't talk about it or something like that . 
and they are doing it you know , unconsciously . 
i guess , uh , you don't really think about it too much . 
i guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff 
but yo , 
a subconscious , you know , thing . 
you know , somewhere they can sit down and write down what , you know , things that you've improved upon , 
you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list . 
but you just don't think about them . 
 and that's true . 
i think , uh , you know , 
we've gotten different programs at work , you know , to , uh , make it visible to management that we are doing things better , 
so how many , um , credit cards do you have ? 
um , i think i'm down to one . 
oh , my gosh , 
i wish i was that way . 
is that why you said i had more experience than you ? 
well , no . 
well , how do you use your credit card ? 
i mean , do you just keep it in reserve , 
i , well , 
the way i'd like to try and use it is , um , at prime buying time 
 and then you pay that off and don't use it until , uh , it's paid off . 
that's my ideal way .
how do you use it ? .
emergencies come along , 
and i 
that's understandable , exactly . 
uh , like , uh , my car , uh , had a major problem , 
and you just never get to use it the way you'd really like to . 
well , actually i do have quite a few more credit cards than you have .
um , and i use them , you know , 
like my american express i use for , you know , gas , things like that , 
and i pay that off monthly , 
and then , um , some other credit cards , like store credit cards , you know , i do have them up there a little bit , 
but , uh . 
i try not to use them too often . 
but living in this area , uh , like i live fifteen miles west of washington , d c 
it's a very expensive area .
so , sometimes you have no other choice if you need to buy something . 
well , i know i was up in there and a lot of credit cards , 
and i was just starting to get to where it was getting me in trouble 
 so we just disposed of them , paid them off , and 
i just . 
well that was good that you had the opportunity to do that . 
now are you married , that you both , you and your wife use a credit card , 
uhhuh . um . 
our only credit card is sears , 
uhhuh , um . 
well , well that's great . 
um , everyone i know here uses , um , credit cards like they're going out of business 
it's just too easy , basically , uh , just get yourself in trouble with those . 
the only other one i have , 
i have like a diner's club where i work 
i see . 
 so that i use , because i travel some . 
so i use that , 
and i don't really have to worry about that , because i only use it for business , 
so i automatically have the money to pay it off . 
but . um . 
uh , i wouldn't mind , uh , you know , getting back into one if they would , you know , 
you start out at a low limit , 
and then they just keep wanting you to increase your limit 
 and if i can get one that'll keep my limit at five hundred 
but they 
eventually gets up there to ten thousand , whatever 
forget it , 
i don't want that . 
um , the temptation's too great . 
so , i don't know , 
just , uh , 
writing checks is just as easy i guess . 
that's true , 
well , really , 
what can you . 
other than , you use them or you don't use them . 
you like them 
or you don't like them . 
i guess , uh , they don't care if we end it early . 
so , uh , hopefully , uh , you have a good thanksgiving . 
that's coming up , 
you , too . 
may be , 
you're the furthest person , actually , that i've talked . 
i've talked to a lot of people in texas . 
texas is the big one . 
 okay , then . 
well , bye now . 
so , how do you feel about capital punishment ? 
well , ends up effectively , uh , uh , uh , avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment 
you don't think , 
yet , on the other hand , uh , i don't know , 
i mean , there is things that 
seems like it's the right thing to do . 
now , you know , i mean fifty children in a school yard , 
you kind of , 
i don't know . 
what about yourself ? 
uh , i have the same dilemma , i think . uh , 
you know , it seems right sometimes 
and then other times , you don't know . 
i mean , people , like , 
it's been , 
i mean , like the arab societies and stuff end up , uh , having effective punishments 
 and they're extremely severe . 
uh , applied . right , 
get caught stealing , they chop off your hand 
and everybody knows exactly what for . 
 uh , you can kind of always count on the fact , 
 or there is a good chance you're going to get off . 
and also , it doesn't seem like it does that many harm , 
i mean , sure , their life is taken , 
but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway , 
so it's more of the easy way out than 
some people , 
except that , i mean , i was amazed at . uh , uh , per year , 
it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year .
uh , you know , and it's 
but on the other hand , uh , uh , you know , that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail , uh  . . . 
but then again , also , you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway , 
it doesn't , 
it seems that by , 
i don't know , 
doesn't ever really , uh  . . . 
oh , i know , 
i mean , you can't , 
it doesn't , 
it doesn't bring back every , 
i really don't know , uh , 
what state are you in ? 
i'm in texas . 
oh , really ? 
in dallas ? 
oh , really ? 
where are you calling from ? 
uh , right now i'm in utah , 
but i'm from plano , texas . 
oh , i see , 
so , uh , uh , what are the laws like in texas ? 
one of the s , well , 
i guess there is more and more states that are going back to capital punishment . 
uh , texas has had it for a while . 
it's one of the quickest , 
once it was reallowed , 
i think it was outlawed for a while , uh , by the supreme court , i mean , or , the interpretation of the constitution 
and it seems like everybody stopped 
to actually , uh , implement it again . 
oh , really ? 
they do it by lethal injection . 
uh , i'm originally from kansas 
and in kansas also , uh , they almost immediately put back capital punishment 
and , uh , there they do it by hanging . 
still , uh , they have , 
i still remember the movie , uh , in cold blood . 
i don't know if you've ever , 
i'm sure you're familiar with it , 
but , have you seen the movie ? 
that way . 
and they do it that way ? 
i mean , the movie was made in , like , nineteen sixtytwo or something like that 
 and so uh , it's not particularly graphic , 
but on the other hand it's fairly impressive to watch them , you know , walk into the room with gallows . 
it's kind of a barn like structure . 
i think they're there , 
i think that capital punishment in utah also . 
i'm not really familiar . 
is that right ? 
are you there in school ? 
but i think they d , 
a long time ago , i remember my dad was telling me this , i think , that , uh , they do it by , like , a bunch of men have guns 
and one of them has the real gun in it . 
has a , 
 so they don't know who killed , 
has a real bullets 
and the rest of them have blanks ? 
i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner , 
i know that .
i've always said that my own meat , i think i'd become a vegetarian . 
i know . 
as long as you're sort of safely removed from it , it so bad , i guess . 
all right . 
go ahead . 
well , what kind of car would i want to buy . 
i don't know . 
the question is , i mean , would i want to buy , 
or would i probably actually buy . 
may be two different things . 
oh , well , all the money in the world or something . 
if i had all the money i wanted , then that's whole different matter . 
in that case , i don't know . 
was a porsche 
but , uh , i don't know if i'd want one of those now . 
oh , really ? 
of course i would want one if somebody was 
but i maybe would buy a b m w .
what do you have now ? 
i've got uh , a dodge daytona . 
it's actually the first car we ever bought new . 
oh , really . 
well , i have 
my car is the first one we ever bought new , too . 
but we just bought another used car , a couple weeks ago , actually . 
me too .
so what car do you drive ? 
what is it ? 
uh , mine is a honda accord . 
we almost bought one of those . 
do you like it ? 
and , and , um , it's funny because , after i bought it , i was doing a lot of business traveling , 
and i , 
some of the cars that i got were like the toyota camry and the nissan maxima and some of the competitors 
 and , um , i don't like them as well except , it wasn't really a fair comparison because those were automatics , 
and mine is a standard 
 and the reason i got a standard was because i thought it handled a lot better 
it had a lot more pickup and everything . 
you get a little more control over when 
uh , what rental agent did you go to to actually rent 
usually avis . 
i guess , 
it's just because we're on , 
i think of it , 
i'm not sure those are avis or not , 
but we have corporate contracts 
i see . 
 so it depends on your destination , too . 
kind of strange .
you work for a big company , then . 
work for t i .
uhhuh . um , 
but yeah , 
uh , i don't know , 
i would probably , if i were to buy a car you know , with the constraints of real money 
maybe it would , 
one thing about the dodge daytona is the fact that they have , uh , this seven year warranty . 
oh , really . 
um , and it really saved us some big money once . 
it did , huh . 
oh , my gosh . 
 and the bill would have been over fifteen hundred dollars , 
and i had to pay twenty five for the , 
oh , that was great . 
it was . 
that's unusual to hear , 
usually , you know something breaks , 
you look at the warranty 
and it's excluded . 
well , the extension 
oh , i see , 
oh , you got your money's worth . 
we did , 
but , you know , we really debated at the beginning , 
that is good . 
but , um , three years left on it . 
well , i've been lucky . 
mine hasn't had any trouble except last week a shopping cart crashed into it 
oh , no . 
 but i was real lucky because it just hit um 
it didn't actually dent the car or anything . 
so it cost me twentyfive bucks to replace 
well , that was good . 
are you . 
um , uh , another accord ? 
 but , you know , if i had to make the choice again , i'm perfectly happy with what i decided 
and that's a legend 
oh , yeah , 
those are nice   .
 um , but it's a used one 
 and , um , my husband has really wanted one for a long time , 
and the fact that , you know , this car that i have has performed so well , 
and before that i also had an accord , 
it was a real old one 
 and , uh , i bought that used . 
i had absolutely no money to my name and bought that , 
and it served me real well , too . 
so he's been impressed with all the honda cars . 
my sister drives one . 
she drives a , uh , i don't know , is it legend 
 it's a , 
i'm not certain , 
but she's liked it . um , 
but , i have never had , 
and we , 
in fact , what i'm driving right now , 
we only had one car for a long time , 
and so , uh , i bought a used yugo 
how did it go for you ? 
oh , well , uh , it's worked . 
hasn't left you stranded . 
i mean , that's exactly what it is , you know , 
it's a cheap little 
i know . 
 and , uh . it's actually kind of fun to drive . 
you know , getting back in the daytona now , i almost don't like it . you know 
it's like too mushy , 
and you know 
well , that's what my husband thinks about my car now , that he's had the legend 
it's too , 
the steering 
it's windy . 
 you know , you feel like you're in a boat or something , you know , 
it's kind of , 
i can't drive that , 
the legend , it's just so huge . 
i don't like it , 
and it's so , uh , 
so , uh , what kind of home repair work have you done ? 
well , um , done a little , uh , repair on the , uh , shingles on the roof recently . 
we've had a lot of wind around here . 
been pulling them up , huh , or just loosening them until the rain came in ? 
are you in the section of texas that's been getting so much rain ? 
but , uh , well , i'm right , 
plano's just north of dallas 
oh , okay . 
 and there are parts of downtown or near downtown dallas that are under water right now , i guess , 
i saw on the news . 
but you're still getting a good bit of the rain , though . 
and , uh , i suppose that means i should be , uh , getting up there to look at that , uh , shingle , 
but , uh 
so i guess i'll let it go awhile . 
is it asphalt shingles , 
 or   .
they're , uh , 
that should be a lot of fun . 
now this , 
we just bought the house last year , 
and , uh , uh , just before we took possession of it we had a fellow go up there and do whatever needed to be done on the shingles . 
so , i've just recently had to start looking at it myself . 
so , it's a small problem so far , 
but i guess you just have to keep on top of it . 
what kind of roof do you have ? 
uh , we're in , uh , campus apartment buildings with flat top , uh . 
oh , then you don't have to do too much with it .
they're just tar and gravel 
oh , it's pretty steep . 
uh , parts of it are steeper than others . 
what do you use to keep from sliding off that rascal ? 
well , uh , .
i imagine . 
and remember to yell geronimo ,
that would be just too much of a fall for me . 
um , have you been , uh , 
was the house reasonably new , 
or you been doing some remodeling work on it . 
it's actually just twelve years old , now . 
that's pretty new house yet . 
it , uh , 
this part of the country , 
actually , they say that when the house is , uh , fifteen , it's already old , 
but just take good care of it . 
thing is , 
uh , the main thing that we've had with this house recently has been some , uh , squirming , i call it , of the foundation . 
we're just on a concrete slab , you know 
 but , uh , the soil right under this is a clay , 
and it , uh , 
it's settling unevenly ? 
and , uh 
 and so during the dry season you have to water the foundation to keep your foundation uh , from , uh , drooping 
 uh , but anytime there's a change in the weather , like the temperature , drastic changes in temperature or in , uh , moisture , uh , you get little spider web cracks all around , uh , windows and doors . 
well , that sounds like a lot of fun . 
well , usually what you do is just wait until you think it's stopped , 
and then you patch them up .
um . what is it like , uh , stucco walls or , 
 uh , i think , with , uh 
but , uh , somehow or other that does manage to , uh , show these little cracks . 
i don't know quite how that works . 
maybe it isn't drywall . 
i don't really know . 
  they plastered over drywall . 
i remember my parents home is drywalled and then they , uh , almost like a small grade stucco type plastering over the drywall 
i expect that's what it is , 
and made for kind of a hard shell on the drywall . 
i think that's the way this is done . 
fortunately we haven't had any real big holes in it yet 
so i , 
that's good . 
the slab floor like that swelling and giving like that . 
well , the previous owner had a major problem with it , because , uh , oh probably a variety of things . 
his neighbor used , 
well , really , 
it's been because of the size or 
i really haven't had to return things because they didn't perform the way they were supposed to . 
most the time they have a pretty good guarantee , 
the only thing i've had lately is , uh , my kids got all these barbie kind of toys for , uh , christmas 
and , uh , it takes them less than a day 
and they're broken in one way or another . 
but i don't know if that's just kids , or if that's , uh , 
what age are your children ? 
i have a five and a half and a three and a half year old that play with them .
and , uh , i don't think they're unduly rough , 
but maybe they are . 
i don't know . 
but , uh , a lot of the little barbie sets 
and they're easily lost and easily broken 
 well , my daughter is twentyone now , 
so it's been a while since we've had barbie things .
it's been a while since they've , uh , gone through the barbie stuff   .
 but we did have barbies and things , 
and there 
seems to me that became a craze when she was already , oh , like , you know , third , fourth , fifth grade . 
so she wasn't in it for very long before she was out of it , 
but , uh , i don't remember her breaking a lot of stuff . 
don't remember her breaking , uh , 
but i also don't remember lots of little pieces 
they've got so many different things with it now . 
 well , that's one thing they've got . 
they've got every type of imaginable , 
camping on the beach , and all of these come with , oh , like tiny , tiny little plates and little sunglasses . 
and , uh 
 my three and a half year old has wanted this ken doll , 
and so i finally got her a ken doll , 
and , uh , less than a week later the arm was broken . 
oh , dear . 
but they were real good about replacing it . 
that's one nice thing , is they're real good about replacing it . 
well , uh , i guess if they'll replace them , then they assume they shouldn't have broken . 
well , you know , those little arms are supposed to twist almost any way 
any direction . 
she's not that strong , that i would 
the main thing that they had when my daughter was playing with barbies was just clothes . 
you know , that was about it . 
that was about it . 
and the barbie doll itself is usually pretty durable and that kind of stuff 
and the main thing my kids seem to be into nowadays are electronics . 
my children are twentyone and twentyfive and twentyeight . 
oh , is that right ? 
 well , do you see that there's a big problem with electronic things ? 
we , uh , haven't had that much , you know , problem with things that we have bought . 
they seem to last . 
in fact , when they offer us extended warranties , 
don't buy them because you don't need them . 
and , uh , it seems like it's just an added tack on . 
plus a lot of the credit cards now , you know , will guarantee , 
if you purchase on your credit card 
oh , yeah .   .
so it seems 
well , you almost assume if you're going to have problems with it , it's usually before that warranty would expire 
the first one . 
and like an extended warranty for cleaning and stuff like that , 
and i never used it . 
you never even needed it . 
and so it seems ridiculous . 
and like  ,
in fact , they usually , 
when they do go out , it's either something my husband can buy the part and fix 
and we don't even have a repairman come , 
or it means it's old enough that it's time to replace the whole thing . 
it's time to replace it . 
so , i mean , 
i think these extended warranties are gimmicks , really . 
i do too . 
a lot of it . 
when we first married , we bought one on our t v 
 and that there's , 
after the first five years , 
and it was ridiculous . 
and they charge you a pretty good price for them too . 
they're a pretty healthy price , 
well , my husband 
i don't know . 
you probably 
with things , 
but now we take good care of things 
and we don't , uh , run out and buy a lot of things either . 
and since our kids aren't little anymore , i'm not buying a lot of those little things that can get broken . 
the little , 
well , you probably are real careful of the brands you buy 
and type of   .
 and , uh , you go around 
and you look at the different ones and find the ones that have the , 
so , uh , what do you think about child care .
oh , . ou know ? 
i mean , i'd wind up , uh , 
just a babysitter in a home . 
probably find someone , 
how come you wouldn't take them to a daycare ? 
just because of the , 
well , too many kids and i think too many infections and things coming in . 
they seem to pass a lot of , 
sicknesses and  , 
i don't know , 
then all the things you hear about them . 
you kind of wonder whether or not , 
i mean i'm sure there's some good ones , 
but i just , 
i don't think that i would , uh , 
i took , uh , cammy to a  , oh , 
it was a preschool daycare type of thing . 
oh , uhhuh . 
 but i liked it some ways 
and some ways i didn't .
uh , i think the ratio of kids to teacher is really important . 
oh , yeah , 
how was it ? 
well , i think they had two teachers 
and i think there were twenty kids , 
but i only had her going two days 
and most of the other kids were going more days 
so that was probably my own fault 
she went , 
oh , you know , one thing i noticed is , uh , uh , just , they were trying to , teach her to write her name , 
and , uh , i didn't notice it until this summer when i was working with her that she would bend her wrist all the way , oh , not in a natural form . 
oh , she did ? 
she was holding her pencil in the right fingers and stuff . 
but she was , 
wrapping her arm all the way around . 
and , uh , i hadn't worked with her on writing at all at that point . 
she was four , or three , 
uh , it was last year 
and , uh , then this summer i got the thing from the school that says things to work with the kids on 
and i w , 
like i said , i didn't notice it till then .
well , they'd never picked it out , though ? 
course , like i said , i took her two days a week 
and maybe that was , 
my main reason for taking her was , uh , just social skills 
i felt she needed the s , 
just , i didn't feel like she was mature enough socially 
 and , uh , 
well , one thing that's kind of different , too , though , a preschool 
oh , yeah . 
i think it would be hard to take them to people you don't know . 
preschool's a different thing , 
but i think it's hard to take kids to somebody you don't know unless you have awfully good references .
i don't know , 
it's so hard to take young kids anywhere for very long . 
well , i think it's hard to leave them , 
it is . 
the older ones it's not , 
you don't even really have any real worries , because you know that they'll play with whoever's there 
and they usually adapt pretty well . 
but , uh , 
it is , i think , just hard to leave them because nobody will give them the kind of care their own families will . 
well , and you know kind of their schedules 
and you know if they're upset and that type of a deal . 
i don't know how , uh , people , uh , that have young kids working work full time do it , really , without being stressed out all the time . 
i think it's , well , 
i don't know , 
then on the other hand i think it's harder to stay home in some regards . 
it's hard to always keep yourself feeling like you're doing something productive , 
and at the end of the day your house still feels like it's a mess , 
and you haven't got anything done 
oh , yeah . 
what am i going to fix for supper .
oh , yeah , 
it is .
is this important what i'm doing 
and  , 
well , uh , the work never ends . 
that's for sure . 
but , probably people that take them to , uh , preschools and daycares full time , oh , 
they would , i don't know , probably just feel different , uh , 
i just think it would be hard to do that full time . 
i feel such a responsibility , even when we go out for a few hours that , 
are they driving the babysitter crazy 
donna , um , you said you have three children . 
what , uh , kinds of activities do you spend with them ? 
is it    ? 
um , we have an eleven year old , an eight year old , and a three year old 
and , um , 
so he spends time doing that with him , planning and , um , practicing outside . 
um , he's a real sports kind of person , 
so he plays tennis with the kids . 
we all kind of play tennis as a family , 
except the baby 
we take turns with her . 
um , uh , let's see , 
we have a computer 
and we do a lot of things with the kids on the computer . 
um , uh , let's what else we do . 
oh , plus we watch a little t v together . 
we really don't watch , i think , as much t v as a lot of people . 
we don't have h b o . 
we do get the disney channel for the kids . 
uh , my kids have a nintendo which they play , 
and my husband sometimes joins them with that . 
uh , my little girl , jennifer , likes to do crafty things , 
and i'll take some time and do that with her . 
and , of course , we always read a bedtime story at night , 
and even and will join in and listen to a story . 
he gets home from work late or whatever 
once in a while he'll read the story to little one , 
but that's basically my job .
um  , 
so do you find it difficult to find time , 
or is it pretty  natural   ? 
 and it , 
and that's kind of cutting into your time . 
and with the kids getting older , now on the weekends they get to the bed like at ten 
but , you know , on school nights , the two older ones get to bed about nine . 
they go upstairs at nine , 
and , um , now , this weekend we'll have a babysitter come 
and , uh , my husband and i will go out to dinner and come home um , probably not too late . 
 uhhuh  .
maybe brian will still be up , and spend some time with him . 
but it's really hard . 
you have to be a very unselfish person to spend a lot of time with your kids , i think . 
do you work during the day ? 
 uh , no , 
last year , um , i had a little part time job in a private , um , high school , tutoring , um , high school students with learning disabilities . 
that was two days a week , 
and even just those two days just seemed like it was a lot . 
i don't know how , 
i admire , 
but with three kids and laundry and keeping the house the way 
i can imagine . 
even just finding the time to do the grocery shopping and everything . 
and that's another thing , 
i'll take one of the kids with me grocery shopping , um , usually on the weekend , 
and that's kind of like a special time for just myself and my little girl or myself and my son , 
and they'll be my helper , 
and then they'll get to pick out some of those favorite snacks that they get to pick out 
but it's , uh , 
and then , of course , they have a pretty , um , busy social calendar too .
you fit it in with all that . 
so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general , you know , in america ? 
i think , you know , it's very easy to fall into that trap , 
but , um , um , i think different parts of the country , 
i think in plano and maybe this area in texas , there's a lot of community activities that parents could join in with their kids . 
people are , 
oh , that's good . 
you know , but , um , 
well , families are facing a challenge , 
i know that with , 
i'm a newlywed 
and we're 
and to cut back to one . 
 um , um , but , you know , if you have the type of job , 
i have a friend that's a nurse 
and she can pick her hours 
that's a great career . 
i wish i would have gone .
because she has such a flexible schedule , 
but it's very hard to , uh , spend time with the children uh , and your husband and 
but i do feel like it's important that you make the time for children  because   , 
well , i think it's a big , um , responsibility . 
you just don't , 
and you do have to give things up . 
i personally feel that it is extremely important to be with your own child , um , for the , 
because they , 
do you have kids ? 
oh yeah . 
how about yourself ? 
uh , we have two and another one on the way . 
oh , you have got , uh , young children then . 
well , yeah , 
we have , uh , a six year old . 
he is oldest 
and then , uh , our baby will be a year on monday . 
oh my goodness . 
that is great . 
what kind of mix do you have ? 
a boy and a girl ? 
two boys . 
do you know what is on the way yet ? 
are you 
and , uh , i don't think we really even want to find out . 
i do not blame you .
we like surprises . 
so . e will take either . 
well , we have got two boys and a girl also . 
and , uh , does it , 
are the two boys first ? 
maybe you will get lucky and get a girl this time . 
maybe , huh . 
we kind of like our boys though too , 
well , our boys , uh , he is in graduate school at a and m , uh , 
he is in the navy . 
he is a lieutenant in the navy 
and the navy is sending him for his masters in ocean engineering 
oh my goodness . 
 and we have got another boy that is , out in maryland . 
he is a wildlife biologist , uh , 
and our girl is thirteen . 
she is in the seventh grade . 
so , we have got , still , all sorts of good activities since , 
oh yeah . 
oh , well what do you do with your seventh grader ? 
well , she is into a little bit of everything . 
she uh , loves riding horses 
so she goes out riding as much as she can . 
do you have horses ? 
well , that , 
she rides english , and does jumping , takes lesson and all that kind of stuff . 
oh , does she ? 
she must really like them . 
she is into , uh , 
well she plays the flute in the band , and , the piccolo , 
and she is into this , uh , odyssey of the mind thing , which uh , takes a lot of time , for , uh , 
what they call peace group . 
i don't know if you have gotten into that with your kids , 
but that is where the , kind of , 
well it is a program for 
i have heard about it . 
our little boy is in the first grade 
and i taught school for six years . 
oh , okay . 
so , i do know about that program 
well , my wife is involved 
and she kind of heads that up for these kids , 
and last year they , got , uh , the state level . 
they did not win that , 
but they , uh , got one local and , uh , one region , 
and they got a new mix of kids this time . 
so , it keeps them busy . 
 oh , uhhuh . 
oh , yeah 
i bet . 
huh , well so does she go actually out into a different classroom with , uh , other kids that are involved in this ? 
well , uh , yes , 
but well they have , 
i think that , uh 
history is what their peace class is this year . 
but , uh , so . 
oh . uhhuh . 
uh , she enjoys that kind of stuff 
oh , how neat . 
so yeah . 
well , uh , as far as our activities , we are kind of on a different level here . 
but , my 
well , you will get to different levels . 
i guarantee it . 
my husband is going to take our six year old to the monster truck show tonight . 
uh , okay . 
they like to , uh 
that will be fun . 
both boy things .
oh , yeah , 
yeah , 
but we , do not have any real , uh , 
like we don't really ski . 
we have not taken our kids skiing or anything . 
of course , the baby is young , 
got to wait a couple years . 
sledding , that is what you have got to do . 
the what ? 
you have got to go tobogganing and sledding with them . 
oh , well yeah , 
we have done that . 
in fact , he just goes right out here . 
we have got quite a bit of snow , uh , 
last week we got a lot . 
well you are welcome to keep that .
i had plenty of snow , 
and we have lived here about seventeen years , 
but we use to take all of the kids tobogganing and ice skating , and all of that kind of stuff 
it is fun really . 
as long as you do not have to drive in it . 
i do not like that . 
really , it makes me nervous . 
i had plenty of snow to last me forever . 
i don't care if i ever see any , 
but keep it off of here .
well , uh , i don't mind it , 
but , uh , uh , the winter gets long . 
you know , i get ready , that , 
come about this time of year i am kind of ready for it to start getting spring , 
and , it is too early yet . 
 well , you have got , 
we do . 
we have had a few early springs though in the last few years . 
they have not been too bad . 
come about march , it gets , you know , a lot nicer . 
oh yeah . 
out oldest son . when , uh , 
you probably , uh , more up on this subject than i am , 
but , the roles that 
well , they've entered the work force more , uh , you know , since world war two is when they started . 
you bet . 
and , uh , i think that that is , you know , very significant that the percentage of the work force today consists of such a high percent of women . 
you bet . 
you know , where i've noticed it more , i think , is , 
i'm a traveling salesperson 
and i have traveled most of my life 
and i know just especially in the last , oh , ten years and really since , 
in the last half of dozen years i see more and more women traveling . 
you know , as far as boarding planes and driving cars and calling on customers . 
i sell sporting goods 
and even in our industry , uh , there was virtually , really and truly no women as far as selling the type of things i sell 
and even in the last five or six years , boy we see more and more women being involved 
and , you know , it's a credit to them as far as how they're doing things . 
you see more of them , uh , leaving their children in the care of their husbands while they do travel , too . 
you bet . 
you know , i have a club that i belong to  on tuesday  that , 
you know , one of the girls travels quite extensively 
you know , why not .
you bet . 
that's sort of neat . 
so i think that's a change 
and i think that's a change you're going to be seeing more of in the future , people having that kind of attitude that the father's going to take more active role in child rearing . 
i think , uh , it's the age old thing , 
every once in a while you read in the newspaper or you'll see it on t v or something where the discussion comes out that , you know , women are paid less than men 
and they're doing the same , uh , or carrying the same job responsibility 
 and , you know , that's a very true statement 
 and uh , it shouldn't be that way .
will change in the near future also . 
i hope so , 
it's been changing , 
it's been evolving , 
but there's still an inequality in the 
it's , you know , 
you know , i've , 
well , he's a man , 
he needs that salary . 
they forget . 
also , i think , uh , a good argument for that is in the area of politics , you know , 
if a , 
a woman congressman i'm sure makes as much as a man congressman and the same as a senator or whatever . 
so , uh , they certainly deserve it all the way . 
but , i guess just the most significant thing changed for me , again , as i mentioned , was just in traveling , 
you see , uh , more and more ladies of all ages with briefcases uh , and in their business suits and 
and going , 
and i expect you're right in regards to having two parents now . 
that's a good statement . 
and i think if , 
in the future it's even going to be , uh , more noticeable and more significant . 
i think it will be . 
i , well , 
another thing i read , too , the other day , 
this is not just for working women 
but how much they're out there , i guess is 
the car designers , uh , are starting to design cars with women in mind . uh , because in the past the male bought the cars , 
but now they're showing that fiftyfive percent of women are actually making the new car purchases .
the man is looking in the engine 
and the woman is looking to how easy can she slide in under the steering wheel .
you bet . 
good point . 
and if they're out there buying that many cars , then there's that many out that are self sufficient and , you know , mobile and working . 
right now i'm self employed 
 and my wife's always worked . 
she's a schoolteacher , 
but for , 
she started working 
and then when i first started my business , uh , 
she was selling real estate at the time 
and hers was the only income we had for three or four months 
you know , she certainly did her part in help getting me establishing in my business 
and she still works everyday 
we all do . 
you bet . 
i just happen to be off today . 
i work , too . 
enjoying it .
what kind of work do you do ? 
i'm a nurse . 
well , good . 
and i work at medical treatment center , uh , which is at uh , jupiter and arapaho . 
married ? 
i don't know , 
you see the old , uh , cigarette ads , you know , about you've come a long way . 
baby , 
and , uh , 
you think about this when it comes to a subject like that 
and it's really true . 
women have come a long way 
and , you know , 
do you have a p c ? 
a lot of my friends are into macintoshes . 
i have a i b m p c myself . 
a two eightysix . 
i'm probably eventually going to get a three eightysix . um . 
what do you use yours for mostly ? 
um , mostly , um , word processing applications and , uh , just as a dumb terminal . 
um , but um , i think eventually i'll start using it for spreadsheets and things like that . 
um , what do you find that you use yours mostly for ? 
well , i do a lot of word processing and spreadsheets and data base , 
and , uh , about the only thing 
uh , i'm just starting to get into , uh , a little bit more communications now . 
i've just today ordered a fax modem 
so i'll be able to 
you don't have to make a hard copy that way . 
uh , are you using windows ? 
well , it's getting to be more and more like a macintosh .
it's , um , 
i just want it more for multi tasking , which i suppose is also like a macintosh . 
well , the one thing i used to use a , uh , 
i've never used an i b m actually . 
i used to use 
that's what i learned a lot of languages on , was an apple two e in my high school . 
but i don't have uh , any real programming capabilities on my , uh , mac right now . 
i don't have , uh , any compilers 
 so i'm , uh . 
i use it in my business . 
well , see , what do you do ? 
i , uh , do , uh , consultation and testing of various kinds for , uh , english as a second language programs . 
oh , wow . 
um , and , uh , uh , do these programs , um , 
on a , um , other language , 
or are they based 
like um , you know , a lot of the english as a second language classes will have people from all sorts of , you know , parts of the world , 
and the teacher just tries to teach english , you know , through natural understanding . 
yeah , that's the kind of thing i'm working with exactly . 
you seem to be , uh , better informed than the average person on that . 
well , it was just , uh , when i was high school , i worked for the community school , 
and they had a english second language class 
and it always seemed strange to me that , you know , all these people that , you know , spoke english not too well , and spoke , you know , a variety of different languages were all being taught at the same time . 
i imagine it's a lot harder on a computer because you know , you don't have as many cues , 
you don't have hand gestures and things like that . 
well , now , we , uh , 
what i use a computer for is to write materials that 
most of the stuff that i do is not , uh , interactive 
 and i use it for uh , data analysis on testing , 
uh , to see how well they retain the vocabulary and things like that . 
you know , when you write a test you have to look at some data from it and see how the different questions are performing 
you try correlate it with other tests and things of that sort . 
so it's , involves a lot of spreadsheet use . 
i would imagine so . 
um , so , um , what were you doing when you were using an apple two e ? 
well , i was doing some of the same stuff , but doing it more slowly  ,
i can't believe , you know , i've got , uh , five , uh , megabytes on this one now 
it's   .
 and on my two e i had a hundred twentyeight k .
it's amazing , you know , how like in the general user community the expectations have just grown so much . 
i remember my first computer was a t r s eighty with four k on it 
 and you know , then i started playing with apples , you know , 
and those had fortyeight , 
or , you know , if they were really great 
uh , i know , 
my goodness . 
i remember that there was one game that i played that required fortyeight k 
and there was only one computer that had fortyeight k on it at the time . 
and you know it's just so amazing that generally , you know , if you , 
i'm not sure about macintoshes , 
but i know i b m s , you know , you buy a megabyte at a time . 
you know , that's the low end . uh . 
well the s p thirty goes up to eight 
 but i haven't upgraded it quite that far yet . 
i think probably when i get system seven i may have to do that possibly another hard disk . 
i don't know . 
they say that system seven uses a lot of memory . 
i imagine   .
okay , bill , 
have you done much camping ? 
uh , yes . 
and i camp at least one weekend 
and during the summer we camp , uh , two or three weeks a year .
oh , well , that sounds good . 
i'd say i camp quite a bit . 
you do . 
um , now do you have a lot mountains , 
where do you find places to camp ? 
well , uh , we do a lot of canoeing when we go camping 
 and uh , we also , uh , carry all our equipment with us 
 and so we canoe down the river and then ,
oh , my word . 
well that sounds adventuresome .
 how about yourself ? 
well , um , i've done , oh , i would say quite a bit of camping , mostly with my husband and i . 
um , we have five children , 
and so we have found that camping with the little ones isn't as enjoyable as just when we go ourselves . 
so we've tried to get out once a year and go on a anniversary camp out , 
and we have gone up into the mountains and , uh , not necessarily roughed it , 
but we have just found it just real enjoyable to be alone up in the mountains . 
well , that's good . 
and , then our boys are old enough now , 
they're twelve and eleven , 
and so , they're involved in the scouting 
and they do a lot of camping with the scouts 
 and last time our one twelve year old went to the scout camp for a week , 
and so this year they'll both be going , 
and so that's been real enjoyable for them . 
uh , what kind of camping do they like best ? 
do they like it where they have tents 
and , uh , do they cook on stoves ? 
um , yes , 
they've , well , 
and i don't think they've taken the stoves . 
um , last year they camped in tents , 
and this year i believe they will be in tents also . 
course i imagine it gets cold in parts of utah . 
it doesn't get very cold in texas , 
so lots of times we don't even take tents . 
oh , is that right ? 
we just use trail tarps . 
oh , and what does that consist of ? 
uh , it's just a piece of material uh , that has a lot of places where you can tie off to it 
they're very light weight 
and we use them when we go backpacking . 
so we go backpacking fifteen or twenty miles , then , uh , 
they're not very heavy , see 
 so you carry them with you , 
well , see , when we go camping here , 
we have to take our big huge , heavy sleeping bags , and lots of tents 
and , i like to sleep on the air matresses . 
i'm not , 
my bones are getting so old , 
so i like to sleep on the matresses . 
um , so , have you had any encounters with wild animals or anything like that ? 
we saw a lot of deer 
my word . 
even though , uh , it wasn't hunting season , 
and we were with boy scouts , 
but we got to see a lot of deer 
and there's , 
of course , we see smaller animals all the time , 
and , uh , one thing that is a big concern in the evening , at night , uh , is , uh , make sure that all the food's put away and so forth 
do you know what 
and possums , and , uh , raccoons . 
my word . 
and we have those creatures down here that uh , they like to go hunting for a midnight snack . 
and so uh , that can be a problem if you don't put all your equipment away . 
they will if you attack them . 
but most time they run away from you 
 but they don't have any problem walking right by you if you're asleep . 
oh , my word .
well , that sounds a little less fierce than bears . 
we want to , 
  music do you like ? 
 uh , lots of different kinds i guess . 
uh , i like country music , of course 
and i listen to christian music a lot because there's a christian music station here in in our city . 
so i listen to it quite a bit . 
i am more into rock and roll myself . 
and i listen cause on friday nights uh , they have what they call saturday night alive 
or friday night and saturday night 
 you know , they have that type of music , 
but they just have different words 
 so , i listen to that too . 
do you like any bluegrass ? 
uh , no . 
 and i like 
 well , at least your , 
do you like rap music ? 
not really .
well , i can tell we're together here .
okay . uh . 
uh , we'll have to , uh 
what kind of 
 i have a lot of friends that like country music .
 what kind of rock music do you listen to ? 
do you listen to like that really heavy metal stuff 
seventies and like that stuff . 
greatful dead , crosby , stills and nash . 
i have friends that like that . 
what  ? 
so you have never heard of like the christian music that i listen to probably . 
i've just , 
like have you heard uh , of carmen ? 
have you ever heard of kim ? 
uh , now i've heard of striper . 
 so the only one i can 
they're the really yeah 
uh , the first of amy grant before 
 you know , became more mainstream , top forty . 
cause she plays both secular and christian 
i like her too . 
i have been to a concert a couple of times of hers . 
i've never actually seen her in concert . 
i imagine that she puts on a pretty good show . 
she's real good . 
so , i like her . 
uhhuh . h , 
i like some country music . 
it's just that i like finding a lot of it's , 
mama got run over by the train . 
i don't like that . 
you know , i like randy travis 
 you know , i like more of the real new ones , you know . 
like garth brooks . 
garth brooks , oh 
reba macintyre . 
i don't care for the older , you know , like the dog left me stuff . 
you don't like patsy cline ? 
you know , but , have you ever been to any of them concerts that you like ? 
that music that you like to . 
 uh , yeah 
but aren't they done with ? 
i thought that they .
they have been touring ,
and i just thought that they done broke up and 
they're still together . 
they're still 
i didn't know that . 
that's interesting . 
in fact , i mean there are people you know that basically just follow them around , from city to city 
but you know like whenever one of them dies off they get a replacement .
you know , they seem to have a really bad time with keyboard players . 
they keep on dying 
and they keep on replacing them 
and the new one's in this thirties you know . uh , 
oh , alright . 
but , uh , 
cause they look pretty rough . 
i mean , i've seen like picture of them 
and they just , 
 well , they don't actually look as rough as the rolling stones . 
they just , 
i don't know if you saw the tour posters of the rolling stones when they last toured , 
but it looked like leather day at the geriatric , 
i mean cause they just , 
all their faces were just all shriveled , 
yuck looking , i mean 
i mean it just just looked like they ,
well are you into that rock music , you know , all that druggy stuff and all that i mean ? 
well , uh  , 
you know what i am saying 
i mean like they come on the stage 
and like , you know , you , 
they don't even know they are there . you know . 
they are just so out of it . 
so , i just don't like you know . 
so , uh , have you seen any concerts lately ? 
um . uh , 
uh , so , do you think our politicians are honest at this point in time ? 
uh , they're entrenched . 
they don't ever have to go out and get a real job . 
they just 
you know what i mean ? 
i agree , uh , with both of those things , 
but , uh , do you see any way of like altering it so that they would become more honest ? 
i think by putting term limitations on you could slow down some of the problems . 
uh , but it has to be not just at the national level but at you know , the state and the local level , too . 
i know some senators , 
and i don't know which ones , 
but they've been in office since the nineteen forties 
 and i , 
they've never had a job . 
i mean they've never gone out in the real world and paid normal taxes . 
i know they pay taxes , 
but they don't 
 you know , they get paid a hundred and twentyfive grand a year .
 and they work you know , less than i do . 
uh , can't just send someone off to washington and expect , you know , his first day to be an effective , uh , congress person . 
uh , there's a lot they need to learn , you know , when you get there . 
i think that's true , 
however , i think that's always been true . 
i mean , that's true of the presidency , too , 
and we seem to be able to get along with the president turnover ever eight years or four years . 
and , uh , 
i mean , there is a lot to learn , 
but maybe it will keep them on their toes and a little bit more active in trying to catch up . 
i think two years is too short . 
i think it  would  have to be extended , uh , you know , 
a term limitation for congress would be like three terms or even four terms 
or you would increase the length of each term of a congressman . 
uh , but maybe standardizing a four year term for congress 
we aren't tackling a massive ballot every four years . 
uh , any particular congress critter has is based on their seniority and how long they've been there 
so it's , you know , for , you know , uh , 
so unless you have actual , you know , across the board uh , you know , the idea of , 
well , we're , 
you know , it's going to wind up hurting your state if all the other states aren't doing it at the same time . 
i think that that's true , 
but then you have the same abuse of power on the flip side of that coin . 
uh , the c i a is moving out to west virginia which is a really stupid location for a large agency like that and for almost any agency . 
i mean , the action isn't in west virginia . 
i hate to tell the senator from west virginia this information , 
the world does not revolve around west virginia 
the world does revolve around d c , you know 
and the c i a is a very large , very high profile agency and to have it located out in west virginia , 
yeah , you know , 
it might only be two hour drive from here , but that's a two hour drive 
 and , uh , you know , i think it's a mistake to move large agencies like that 
 or is it the f b i . 
i don't remember , 
but i think there's , 
well , i mean , l , 
i don't see why it makes a big difference the c i a because , you know , officially they don't have any operations within the united states other than administrative . 
that's officially . 
i mean , we all know that that's not necessarily true . 
but or , not having a complete turnover every , some small number of years . 
i think i mean there's an institutional memory that you need to maintain . 
but i think that , uh , with all the perks that we've given them , 
i mean , i heard on the radio back their restaurant bills 
 uh , one of the radio stations over here listed off every single one of the perks . 
well , we have , 
we used to , when i was younger 
we'd go every weekend . 
 all right  .
but we haven't done whole lot of it lately . 
i'm kind of into it . 
i'm , uh , kind of a sailor . 
i'm up in minneapolis now , 
but i was in florida  , 
so , uh , yeah , 
i was kind of into it for a while there . 
were you sailboating ? 
yeah . 
i had a little sail , 
well , we don't get to do a whole lot of that up here .
just motorboat's all we , 
what part of texas you from ? 
uh , nacogdoches . 
whereabouts is that ? 
that's between houston and dallas . 
all right . 
it's the oldest town in texas . 
is that right ? 
that's pretty wild . 
we have , uh , lake sam rayburn out here and lake nacogdoches , 
so we do a lot of boating on . 
so you got some lakes around you can do that on . 
you do skiing and stuff 
all right . 
just got through snow skiing .
all right . 
that sounds good . 
uh , our , 
the snow up here is really kind of starting to melt now . 
it was heavy when we were there though . 
i didn't see any boats there , though . 
not too many , no . 
but , uh , no , 
i just got back from a weekend . 
we went and , uh , had a , kind of a picnic in the woods type thing . 
it was pretty nice , 
but , uh , no , did a lot of sailing on and stuff . 
that's a lot of fun , 
but , uh , my parents are pretty big sailors , too , 
they're kind of into it . 
uh , all we have up here mostly bass boats . 
oh , yeah , 
lot of fishing going on up here . 
all right . 
so , where about in texas is that ? 
is that centrally located 
it's , uh , well , 
you ever heard of lufkin ? 
uh , no , 
what major city is nearby ? 
let me see , 
houston's north . 
dallas is south . 
oh , okay , 
all right . 
well , that sounds pretty good . 
does , uh , 
i guess the weather , 
does that stay pretty constant there 
probably eighties in the afternoon . 
well , that's pretty temperate . 
that's not too bad . 
but , uh , yeah , 
have you done , uh , any other boating then 
but that's all , 
i used to his daddy owned a boat shop . 
and go boating every day just about . 
oh , that's great . 
and we had a different boat every day . 
oh , that's fantastic . 
i used to , uh , kind of be that way myself when i lived in , uh , north western florida in the panhandle , 
i used to sail about every day . 
i'd go to work , 
i'd like to do some sailing . 
it's a lot of fun . 
it's , uh , 
especially if you get a pretty fast boat 
like those catamarans are pretty fast . 
you can actually , 
if you get one like that  do  have somebody teach you that 
or they just , 
uh , my family's pretty into it 
 and , uh , i took sailing lessons when i was about six 
and then , uh  , 
is it pretty easy ? 
so it's not too bad , 
it's pretty easy to get the hang of , i think 
and , uh , generally , everybody i've known has kind of gotten into it , 
but some people are more motorboaters , you know 
well , that's about all we have .
lot of people don't see the excitement in sailing , 
but , then , again , they may never have tried anything like , uh , catamaran 
 and , uh , that's when you really start getting into speed . you know , 
some catamarans you can actually pull people behind , the skiers , 
they get so fast , you know . 
i didn't know that . 
they get pretty quick , 
i haven't personally done that , 
but , uh , the races , 
i work with a guy right now that , uh , races catamarans in the summertime 
 and , uh , he's pretty gassed about it . 
he's got a good , uh , 
what lake do you all use ? 
 so he usually goes on one of the great lakes , i think , and does his sailing . uh , 
for me , i go back to orlando , uh , in about a month , and so , down there , basically just go to the coast . 
we're about thirty miles from coco beach and the east coast , 
and there's a lot of places there you can go , you know . 
 uh , so that's a good thing . 
yeah , so , what do you do for a job ? 
uh , i build transformers . 
oh , really ? 
is that for t i 
are they primarily electronic , then ? 
well that , 
they have a , you know , worldwide , 
all we do here is make transformers 
oh , okay . 
how do you like it down there in texas ? 
it's real nice . 
been here all my life . 
oh , no doubt . 
i've never been to texas . 
i've been to oklahoma , 
but , uh , that's about as far as , 
oh , oklahoma's nothing like it . 
well , that's good , because i didn't like oklahoma that well .
so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products ? 
uh , not too bad really . 
uh , i had a razor that i got from christmas that i really didn't want it , 
but i got it anyway 
and , uh , it was a braun 
and they were real good about taking it back . 
it wasn't a problem at all , 
so , uh , i was able to get that back pretty easily . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
i really haven't returned a whole lot lately . 
have you ? 
it's , uh , the , 
every so often , 
i mean , i'm almost pushing it myself . 
maybe i'll buy a shirt from g i joe's 
and it shrinks too much 
i mean , i bought it from g i joe's 
 and it was probably made in china by slaves . 
but , uh , they , uh , 
most of the time   pretty careful shopping anyway , i get pretty good stuff . 
i think that , uh , aside from the fact  all  markets being internationalized 
 and if you want to buy american  , it takes real extra work to find . 
it's probably 
i was reading , 
i was reading something in , uh , consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact . 
they were talking about cars , uh , the car issue just came out . 
but , uh , you know , the transmission may be made in japan or whatever . 
uh , like i've got an eightysix ford ranger 
 and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi . 
you know , so it's like , what are you going to do , you know ? 
but , uh , that's the way it is . 
i don't know , 
i personally feel that , uh , uh , if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them , you know , that's the way it goes 
and , you know , people , more than manufacturers should get a clue 
and , you know , they should start making quality products . 
i think they're beginning to . 
the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away 
that's what i thought , too , until i saw the consumer reports issue . 
uh , they've got all the cars rated , you know , 
and , uh , essentially , i don't see much of a trend . 
i mean , just like every other time that you look at it , the honda accords and the civics are right up there . 
there's nothing wrong with them . uh , and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars . 
but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy 
and they're pieces of junk . 
i know . 
still at it , hey . 
that's eightysix through ninetyone . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
maybe they're getting better , 
maybe they're starting to get a clue . uh , 
well , they got a three year lead time . 
it probably won't start really showing up until ninetyfour or so .
that's just it . 
technology that comes in right now implemented until , you know , quite a few years down the road . 
but , uh , 
the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer . 
oh , yeah . 
because technology is so , uh , you know , volatile and changing all the time . 
and can you 
if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out , you'll get a free version in the mail s ,   .
uh , with it pretty quickly 
and that's a real good thing , i guess . 
uh , i don't know . 
and well , i mean , all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity 
and the macintosh is about the only one that's going right 
they're kind of the leaders right now , you know . 
i used to see all those commercials for windows , you know , 
why don't they just say , almost a mac for half the price . 
yeah , you know . 
they'd sell more if they were honest . 
almost is the key word , there , too , you know , because i've used both 
and i really don't see an advantage of windows at all . 
yeah , it 
yeah that's true , too . 
but , uh , i don't know , 
the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home . 
i do use a mac at work 
but , uh 
but , uh , 
apple's sort of making a s , 
 and they're ones were  
growling consumer , uh , need to worry about the mac they're getting , 
like if you bought a power book straight off , a lot of them had to go back . 
they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with 
you sound like you must , uh , work in the computer business . 
i do desktop publishing at work 
and i have a machine at home 
and i belong to the user's group 
and i've been a mac fanatic since they came out . 
all right . 
but , uh , technically , i'm not actually in the industry . 
i don't work a computer company . 
i'm an abuser . 
well , that's all right . 
but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to 
that's true . 
something that i find uncomfortable is , you know , you want to buy something , say you want to buy a personal computer 
and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for , you know , 
let's take the example , the modem for , you know , 
what baud rate do you get ? 
well , you know , it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba , 
so , um , how do you feel about the crime in your city ? 
is it , uh , 
 well , um , minneapolis isn't too bad . 
uh , i know that there's been some increases in crime lately in terms of murders . 
 uh , that's kind of gone up in scale and some other things . 
uh , i personally had  a little  experience the other day . 
uh , somebody broke my passenger window and stole a uniform out of my truck . 
oh , really . 
but , actually , you know , when you look at minneapolis as compared to where i used to live , it's really quite a bit better .
and in orlando , crime is getting to be a bigger problem than ever , 
oh , yeah . 
what part of california are you from ? 
san jose , california . 
oh , really ? 
i have a good friend there . 
here , you know , the real problems are the gangs . 
yeah   .
a lot of murders , uh , just in general the whole , 
we've only been here a couple of years . 
uh , before that we lived in colorado 
but in comparison to colorado , it's real noticeable . 
oh yeah . 
 i mean i mean , i can just sense , 
i mean i won't go to the grocery store at night . 
that's  , 
you know . 
and it's that kind of thing 
and , uh , 
that's really a shame when it has to constrain your activities like , 
we have a neighborhood watch program in uh , the development that we live in , which i think is a great way to reduce , uh , home theft , burglary , and things 
do you have that where you live 
well , uh , interestingly enough , right before i moved up here , 
i'm an intern 
and then i go 
uh , but in orlando , before i moved up , we had a real problem with it . 
uh , we've been broken into in my apartment about four times 
oh , no . 
and one of the things that i helped organize was a neighborhood watch type situation 
uh , because they were just , 
it's one of those things where the new thing is that they operate in the daylight because 
and then the houses were left unguarded , uh , 
but yeah , 
i think given that people are pretty conscientious about it , 
that's a good way to work it , with a neighborhood 
well , you know , uh , also i've heard that , uh , the newest thing is a lot of people are specializing in robbing people during the time they're home .
oh , is that right ? 
a high percentage of , uh , free time , 
i think it's like fifty percent of most people's free time is , uh , spent doing yard work 
so they wait while you're outdoors . 
they know the house is unlocked 
and then they just slip in .
that's amazing . 
they know exactly what they're going for . 
so , i've heard that's really on the rise as far as 
it almost seems like they're getting quite a bit smarter . 
really , you know . 
unfortunately , yes . 
unfortunately it's starting to really , you know , look at people's habits and 
 like one of the guys i work with really laughs when he looks at minneapolis because he's from detroit 
 and , uh , quite a bit , uh , more pronounced , uh 
 but , uh , yeah . 
i guess , 
i mean , 
i think we've got a neighborhood watch program here in minneapolis , 
i'm not real sure . uh , 
it helps to know your neighbors , you know . 
they give you , 
you're supposed to make lists of , uh , cars . 
like i know a lot of my neighbors right around my development . if i see a car that's unfamiliar , we have a list 
is that what you did in your program ? where you have a list of license plates ? 
yeah . 
i was basically , involved in that , in the organization of it . 
and then i left right in the middle of it . 
i'm not sure 
 oh , uhhuh . 
yeah . well . 
yeah , 
that whole thing of being alert and kind of noticing your surroundings , noticing people who look suspicious 
 i mean , you hate to be paranoid 
but there are really only so many things you can do . 
you can have the house alarm , uh 
 uh , you can do that which is what i choose to do . 
one of the frustrating things about that is that you really are limited 
 even if you know that the threat is there 
it's against the law to do a lot of things , you know . 
they could basically , uh , 
when i was getting robbed down in florida , i was really considering electrifying doors 
they did in miami that time . 
but it's not , uh , 
if you kill someone in your home , as long as they are in your home , it's considered selfdefense though . 
that's not always true . 
it isn't ? 
and essentially what he had done is set a electrocution trap 
the guy came in while he was home 
and , sure enough , he fell into the trap and was severely burned . 
he didn't die , 
but he was severely burned 
and he took the guy to court and won a settlement . 
it's like your hands are very much tied . 
well i think a handgun though , in other words it wasn't premeditated , you had a handgun , it's the middle of the night , someone's down , 
uh , i've had , uh , three boys through , i guess , uh , some child care , each one of them 
and now they're in school 
so it's all over 
but , uh , i guess i would say it's not easy to find what most parents would want . 
well i can profit by this because i'm due with my first in about three months . 
is that right .
i guess , uh , the only rule , uh , i can think of is that i like to look for places with , uh , good respectable , nonprofit behind them like a university or a hospital or something like that . 
if they're associated with a college or a university , they're usually a pretty good bet . 
uh , i think it's sort of the opposite of what you would want when you buy a car or refrigerator something . 
you'd like to get it from some good cutthroat capitalist child care . 
i guess not , 
i suppose you're absolutely right there . 
for profit 
but , uh , when my kids were young , i was teaching at a university 
and , uh , the child care center associated with our university was quite good 
for their pet theories or some such thing ? 
but , yeah , 
i guess that's true . 
but , uh , .
of course , you also tend to get people that are associated with the university and the hospital as the parents , 
and they , you know , 
pretty good people .
um . well , the thing i really worry about is , uh , the sexual abuse cases you read about . 
and i mean you'd just feel awful if something like that happened . 
i never really worry very much about it . 
i tend to think those are very rare but quickly exploited and made public 
so , i 
uh , you know , i think those things get into the headlines immediately when somebody finds out about them 
i don't think it's as common as , uh , the newspapers would make you believe .
and another thing is cost . 
oh , yeah .
i mean that , 
i know so many of my friends i went to school with who are having babies right now 
and in some cases they're finding it's just not worth it to work because it's all going out in daycare . 
well , in our case , we made the decision that my wife would stay home until the boys were , uh , in school . 
and i'm really happy we did it , although it was very , very difficult . 
and uh , we just decided that we would do it 
and we went ahead 
but , uh , not everybody can make that choice 
 and just for part of the day . uh , or a couple of days a week just so that , uh , other things could get done around the house and so on , 
i think my wife is much better than i am at that walking into a place and getting a feeling for whether it is a loving and caring place or not 
  huh  .
huh . well i'm just thanking heaven . 
my husband just got a new job . 
his last company , he was only working four days a week . 
so it's , 
and he just got a new job . 
he's getting lots of overtime , 
he got a pay raise 
and so i'm just grateful that we don't have to worry so much about my working or not . 
there's absolutely no question that you're going to be the best child care provider for that kid 
so , yeah , do it as long you can .
i suppose . 
but i think , you know , you have to look through a place 
and you have to get a feel for , uh , how they treat the kids and , uh , uh , what kind of staff members they have and 
and the main thing is that you have to determine that they're perfectly open . that you're welcome anytime without notice , in the middle of the day and so forth 
and if they're at all queasy about that then 
you have to start wondering if they don't want you . 
you have other friends that have kids , uh , being taken care of in , uh , child care ? 
but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while . 
uh , tend to sensationalize the problems . 
i think the problems are more ones of cost and resources and , uh , pay and exhaustion and  , 
this is true . 
current affair can  , 
uhhuh . well , 
why don't you go ahead and start . 
well i think the court systems could stand some improvement . 
uh , trial by jury is good 
but i mean prove a person guilty if you don't really know or you don't really have an eyewitness . 
and how can you convict somebody on circumstantial evidence is beyond me . 
i don't know . 
so you think not to convict people on circumstantial evidence ? 
i attended a trial in , uh , germany when i was a student 
and , uh 
the trials are held by a panel of uh , three or four judges who are , well , 
they're like lawyers i guess . 
they're experts in the law 
 and , uh , there really isn't a jury 
and , uh , uh , they do the questioning also . 
the judges do the questioning 
and , uh 
uh , i , 
i think it's a lot harder to get off on technicalities also because uh , uh , the judge is also sort of a jury , uh , 
but i'm not sure i like that .
i think i prefer the jury system myself . 
you think you prefer the jury ? 
you think your chances are better ? 
what i worry about is cases where it's the government against the individual . 
that's where you really need a jury of peers .
well , that's true . 
i think that's really the only thing . i guess where i would like to see the system change is , uh , uh , there ought to be a  well  
i guess i don't think that , uh , uh , juries need to decide sentencing all the time . 
i think maybe a judge is a better judge of that 
or , uh , 
well , is not fair . 
i mean even if , well the jury , i guess they do decide that 
 but , i'm like you , 
in a case like that , most of the time its , 
i don't know , 
maybe i'm too , uh , uh , conservative when it comes to that . 
the sentencing is really light compared to what i think they should be in a lot of cases 
 well if you drag twelve people into a courtroom , i trust them to make the right decision as to whether someone's guilty or innocent . 
that's usually a matter of who to believe and what facts to believe . 
but people who don't have day in and day out life long experience with what prison is really like and what the options are , to ask them to decide for one case , on one person , based on what they see , i think that is maybe , uh , a little bit naive . 
in texas here , people tend to get whipped up into a frenzy and slap long sentences on people . 
uh , it's kind of , uh , uh , a hanging jury atmosphere .
but in a lot of places , i think people bend over the other way , 
but goes before a jury for sentencing or whether the judge gets to choose it . 
some cases in some jurisdictions , they can do that . 
oh really ? 
i kind of like that system . 
yeah . 
that's not a bad system . 
but i do think it needs to be shaken up a little bit . 
but , the thing is too , maybe they need i don't know , more of a expert types 
and lawyers blow sand in their eyes . 
i would like to see most civil cases tried before a panel of experts instead of ordinary juries . 
insurance cases and things like that . 
where  , 
and , uh , there would be more honest settlements instead of this , uh , tugging of people's heart strings and , uh 
exactly  , 
so . in criminal trials you need the jury as a defense against the government 
have you had that experience recently ? 
but i think uh , in atlanta , georgia . 
i believe it was like these juice machines 
and , uh 
 oh , yeah . 
but i found that , uh , it was made of some material which actually ended up rusting 
even , despite , you know , diligent washing , it got rusty after about , uh , three weeks of use . 
and i don't think it was my fault because you know , i had made a point of like drying it off and cleaning it 
but , uh , uh , it was , 
i had to send it back after like , you know , the third week because i realized like , it was not , 
something was very , very wrong with the blade . 
uh , what about you ? 
well , i don't have so much trouble with products as service . 
i don't feel like that's as big a problem . 
i've had a few answering machines over the last two years just because i've had a lot of trouble with them working correctly . 
and i'm not convinced that any of them work a hundred percent . 
uh , the one i have now is okay , most of the time . 
but that's it . 
but that's probably the worst . 
my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed . uh , james avery . 
i don't know if you have that up there 
but it's a very good company . that 
 and the catch broke 
and she was sitting in school on a carpet 
and when she stood up , it caught and broke 
and we took it back 
this was yanked . 
i mean they were so rude about it . 
and so we wanted a different kind of catch 
so do it anyway . 
so we got the kind we wanted 
and i was really disappointed with that . 
i felt that this was a company that should have been more reliable 
 and i happened to need a birthday present for one of her friends 
and i called there to see if they had it 
and the lady was very nice . 
and she told me 
and it turned out she was the assistant manager 
so i felt kind of good about that , you know . 
i didn't 
 but i just felt like , well at least i did something . 
maybe they'll fix it . 
they might work on that , you know . 
 but i find attitudes are more of a problem . 
service is more of a problem . 
i find , 
up here in the northeast , we have these mail order companies like l l bean 
and , uh , they are famous for , i guess , having really topnotch service . 
they've got , uh 
 i mean i've heard stories where you can literally buy something from them one year , wear it for a year and a half , 
and even after , like eighteen months of , you know , reasonably satisfactory use , they will accept it in any condition 
and they will gladly , no questions asked , take it back if for some bizarre reason you decide you don't want it anymore . 
uh , they'll actually do things like this . 
i mean bend over backwards service wise for you . 
that's really great . 
i guess you can get , uh , the eight hundred number of the customer service support line for a number of companies . 
and , um , actually i've tried that with a few companies lately . 
and most of them have been pretty good , 
but i was , 
one reason why , like i buy a lot of clothing through mail order is that , uh , if you buy through bean or though , 
uh , i guess one of bean's big competitors is land's end out in , uh , i guess it's wisconsin somewhere . 
uh , they're very good about 
like the customer is always right 
and you know , no matter how crabby you might be over the phone , they are very understanding 
and , uh , they ma make sure things are set properly if you're any way dissatisfied with their merchandise . 
that's really good . 
it use to be like that . 
i don't think most places are like that anymore . 
 well uh , with the economy the way it is , i guess , 
there was a story on the news tonight about how , because a lot of companies are , uh , you know , 
things are getting rough out there , 
there's a lot of , you know , 
the morale among employees tends to go down and that , in turn , like , you know , 
and , uh , one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having , especially for repeat offenders that , uh , 
maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again . 
uh , so that , uh , a judge , i think , would be the most appropriate person uh , to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day . 
i kind of agree with that ,
uh , i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case 
 so a judge , you're right , should have the whole dossier of the criminal 
and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better position to give an appropriate , uh , sentencing . 
see i agree with you . 
uh , one thing i heard was this , where a mock court . 
i mean , it's supposed to be all legal and everything . 
uh , you go 
and you present your case , 
the other side presents their case 
and you're done with it . 
it's almost like the night court we see on t v . 
uh , uh , but it's not that we have , uh , such , 
it didn't backlog uh , the cases that are , uh , all ready pending . 
uh , so i , 
that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way . 
in other words , not , 
there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial ? 
there's a point on which we don't agree . 
i would tend , myself , to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases one of the parties wants one . 
and usually it is the defendant , i guess , that wants to have the jury hear the case . 
so i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we , uh , 
that would require a change in the bill of rights , i believe 
and so , 
i didn't mean that .
 oh , oh , okay . 
i didn't mean that , no . 
because , i mean , gee whiz , if i uh , uh , didn't have that right , you know , not to have a jury that , oh 
yes , i would feel , uh , you're right , that my civil rights had been violated . 
but i meant for some , when both parties agreed that yes , we're going to have a judge here . 
we're not going to have a jury , you know , 
let's get it over with . 
sort of like car accidents , you know , 
well i think that's all ready possible . 
i think ,
 so . i agree that that should be encouraged . 
people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial . 
but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to clients unless they feel they can , you know , tweak a jury into 
giving a different sentence . 
the take . 
and i suspect it , in cases like , 
is that right ? 
well , uh , in the case of ,
and i think that may be where jury use is overdone , 
i mean there are cases where they could be settled ,
but the lawyers are really , uh , 
it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience  ,
 so . uh , i was wondering too , if they were thinking about the judge making awards in civil cases 
uh , i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that . 
but i am in favor of it for criminal cases 
so there's a difference of my view there for those two . 
bu , well you can tell i haven't been in too many judges chambers or anything like that .
have you ever had to serve jury duty ? 
well i was called once when i was nineteen 
 uh , but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me 
and , i was doing school and things like 
they let me out . 
an , i've never had to it since 
and that was almost twenty years ago .
it isn't , 
sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time ,
that would have been about , uh , twenty years too 
 uh , uh , just last year 
and , uh , the case i heard was a criminal case 
and it seemed it really ,
it involved two bicycles . 
we didn't do the sentencing . 
the judge did . 
how interesting . 
 rendered a verdict 
and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing . 
 and that was here in wisconsin . 
so i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it , 
i'm nevin from sunnyvale , california . 
this is jim bliss from minneapolis , minnesota . 
how you doing ? 
pretty good . 
uh , i'm ready whenever you are . 
so , uh , what are your thoughts on the subject there ? 
well i definitely think , like decisions have to be unanimous . 
i think that's probably a good thing . 
it's probably the safest thing . 
i mean , it's to easy to get a quorum 
 and simple majority won't do . 
and even like , you know , twothirds majority , i mean , it's  , 
quorums are to easy to get . 
and there's always that chance that one or two people could be playing devil's advocate for a good reason , you know . 
so it's 
but , uh , i don't know . 
i couldn't believe they suggested that judges should be doing the sentencing . 
 like  gives them a little too much power .
i know of a couple of people at least who would be arguing with that . or arguing against that pretty vehemently . 
but , uh , 
plus , you know , you may be , you know , doing , you know , a guilty verdict 
but you know , it may be for technical reasons .
about the only good thing i would say about that is that it would , uh , hurry the process up a bit 
 but i mean even now i know we've got plenty of cases out there where people have been wrongly convicted and things like that 
i know   .
i mean , jeez if the judge was doing it himself , without any checks and balances 
there would be much more of that .
no doubt . 
are you involved in the legal system at all ? 
  but  .
i've got some friends that are lawyers 
i do too 
one of them just got his law degree . 
but , uh , to tell you the truth , i'm not real familiar with , uh , the system of jurisprudence the way it is right now . 
i really haven't studied it in depth . 
i know a little more about civil cases than criminal cases .
it's more in how you present it versus , you know , who's right . 
i'm sure of it . 
because a lot of those things , it's largely a matter of viewpoint .
uh , it's kind of weird . 
i don't know , 
i always think about watching the people's court or something .
it's just , 
the opposition will say this , this and this and  , 
and it's like , boy , the stuff that they can twist around 
it's pretty amazing . 
and it's like the truth isn't really important anymore . 
it's not . 
and then you get people who bring in cases just because they want to bring them up just because . 
like this friend of mine's pretty obnoxious 
and he really gets into suing people . 
and so he'll sue just about anybody just for the chance to get into court ,
 but , uh , 
but it's for the more general , 
people don't want to take responsibility . 
 you know , it's , 
 and most of the time they're looking to place blame . uh 
see , you're from california , 
is that right ? 
uh , yeah . 
oh , okay . 
i was just thinking 
how the civil system or the court system must differ between there and say where i am in minneapolis .   
i really , 
from what i understand , it's all pretty the same except when you get to louisiana . 
and louisiana is completely different cause it was based on the , 
what is it , 
it's based on common law 
pretty strange . 
but , uh , fortunately i never have had to go in 
i haven't either other than , 
but , uh , that friend of mine's telling me that i might have to go in uh , as a witness . 
he may subpoena me . 
so we'll see what happens . 
but , uh , 
i'm not really sure how we could change the legal system to make it better .   .
there are too many big problems , you know . 
there's such a backlog of court cases right now .
i know . 
and we already have too many lawyers as it is . 
and if it's criminal cases you can't put them in jail because there's no room left . 
that's true . 
and , in fact , they're even letting some go . 
i'm originally from florida 
and it's like 
that's not a good solution either . 
not at all . 
i'm not real sure what the , 
what do you think about capital punishment ? 
well , i'm kind of in favor of it for certain crimes . 
which crimes do you feel that ? 
well , i think first degree murder , uh , probably warrants it . 
because of , 
so many times it's so brutal and just recurrent 
  selling , i think  should also . 
recurrent crimes like serial rapists or serial murderers or 
well i originally come from the state that has , uh , the death penalty . 
i come from florida . 
and , uh , they're pretty liberal on it . 
they tend to , like , fry people left and right .
go ahead . 
go ahead . 
texas is too . 
texas , i saw on t v the other night , has had fortysix in like the past several years . 
so they're pretty hip on it too , i guess . 
they do it by lethal injection , at huntsville . 
i think florida still uses electric chair . 
uh , i don't know . 
in some ways i don't like it because it's like they're playing god . 
and that's not , 
i don't think that's right . 
but on the other hand , there's a lot of advantages to it . 
i think crime rates deterred a little bit by using it 
and , of course , you have some savings in terms of taxpayer money keeping people in jail or not . um , 
with florida that's a big problem because there's so many people in jail that they have to let them out every year . 
that's what's happening here . 
there is , 
like , uh , that's , 
in fact , a big gubernatorial issue is 
and you know , that's a big problem 
but there's not a whole lot you can do about it because there's only so many jails you can build 
 and a big problem . 
uh , go ahead . 
i wish if they were going to do it , they would be a little more consistent in dealing with who gets lethal injection and who doesn't . 
be a little more , you know , 
not being able to put it off for fifteen years . 
because a lot of these guys , you know , they get in 
and they get off for good behavior 
and , i don't know , 
up in minnesota where i am now , they don't have the death penalty . 
and you can almost sense that people are just laughing at the system , you know . because they figure well , you know , sure i get thirty or forty years for maybe rape or something . 
uh , but then for , 
if i  elicit  good behavior i'm out in maybe five or ten . 
oh , really ? 
i mean just because , like we said before , they don't have enough room in the jails 
but if you've got the death penalty hanging over your head , uh , 
i don't know , 
i think that may solve a lot of that . 
maybe not solve it , 
but , i don't know , 
maybe    , 
little too lenient . 
uh , kind of takes away from the significance of the death penalty . 
what do you do georgeanne ? 
i'm a graduate student at the university of texas in dallas . 
oh , okay . 
what program you in ? 
uh , audiology . 
fantastic . uh 
what do you do ? 
i'm a doctoral student at the university of central florida . 
oh , really . 
oh really ? 
uh , yeah . 
but , uh , i don't know . 
it's an interesting issue . 
like you say , in texas there's been quite a few 
and in florida in the last few years , i think there's been a lot . 
you know , i can't give you figures 
but , uh , 
i just , 
this was in conjunction with the guy that was put in the gas chamber in california . 
so , i think it , 
the fortysixth in the last twentyfive years i think is what 
oh , is that right ? 
they gave a run down that 
i kind of , 
yeah , i've heard things about that . 
i've heard that they don't mess around very much . 
uh , they don't get repealed as easily as they do . 
like the guy in california got thir , you know , twice before he went to the gas chamber 
you don't have to go . 
and then they took him back . 
i mean , 
that's a lot of repeals . 
and then you have like two , 
you have these people who are serial killers that didn't even get the death sentence back when 
i don't know . 
i'm trying to think about other crimes that would warrant it . 
uh , i guess , 
what's the policy now with treason ? 
or death before the firing squad or whatever . 
so , i think about the only one is , uh , rape , 
i'm here . 
how do you feel about public schools ? 
well , our public schools are really poor , i feel . 
uh , i'm not sure where georgia ranks in the nation 
but , uh , we're toward the bottom . 
and , uh , there's a lot of things that i see that are so obviously wrong .
but the system doesn't allow for the corrections .
how about you ? 
well , that's interesting . 
i have a sister who used to live in kennesaw , georgia . 
oh , yes . 
and , uh , she has a young boy . actually has two boys now but only had one when she was there . 
and she complained quite a bit about their school system there . 
and cobb county is better than the county i'm in . 
she was in cobb county . 
i can't really say much about the schools up here . 
i really don't come from here 
i'm only up here temporarily on an internship 
and the schools down there , from what i know , are not bad . 
they're pretty good . 
well , that's great . 
 but i know in a lot of rural areas they're not that good . 
for example , i have a brother in north carolina 
and he says the schools there uh , just terrible . 
well , i feel that we're way behind . 
uh , i have a son that is in the fourth grade 
 and , uh , they have just now taken up division . 
that is slow . 
 uh , i , 
my husband and i go to the store 
and we buy these math books and fractions and multiplication , division things 
and i feel like , uh , there are several areas that we're just really , really slow in . 
and , uh , i don't blame the teachers as much as i blame the system . 
it is , 
what do you think's wrong to cause that ? 
 well , for one thing there's not enough money in the school system . 
and the money they do have , they do not use it wisely . 
uh , my son's teacher has twentyseven students . 
and that's certainly is a lot of students for one person to deal 
 but more than that , i don't think that they have the authority to command the attention of the children . 
and when you have two kids in that class that constantly keeps the class in an uproar and you're not at liberty 
that's one thing i worry about   .
uh , also i think , we have a lot of , uh , hispanics 
there you go , 
 and we have a lot of , uh , 
the county i'm in , the minorities are mostly hispanic . 
probably quite a few black people up there 
 we're from the county they marched in . 
we're in  forsyth  county 
 oh , is that right ? 
and we , 
and there's very few blacks . 
oh , okay . 
uh , so that's , uh , 
i hate to say , uh , 
it's not a problem , uh , because i hate to feel like they are a problem , although they are . 
but , you know , it's , 
you don't want to seem racist or prejudice or whatever , 
but then again . 
 but it is a problem .
there is no denying that , 
sure , you know . 
you have to admit that teachers have to slow things down for people who don't understand , especially if there's not a very well developed special education program at the school . 
and you can't put all the children in special education . 
that's right , 
you can't do that . 
uh , and if the parents do not care enough to take an interest in whether the homework is done 
see , i grew up in nebraska 
 and the school that i went to there was fantastic . 
very lucky . 
uh , we had a school that had classes probably about the same size you're talking , twentyseven , thirty kids to a class . 
 but your teacher had control . 
we zipped right along , you know . 
but , you're right , you know . 
with all this , don't hurt the kids and don't abuse their rights , you've also taken 
 uh , well , it really is a concern of mine because if we could afford it , my son would be in private school . 
we just cannot afford it . 
i was going to ask you if that was an option . 
uh , if , 
uh , i'm of the age that could have gone , although i didn't 
and , uh , i guess , uh , looking back on it , i tend to think it was uh , mostly a mistake . 
on the other hand , uh , the more i learn about the history , the more i see it was incremental , uh , decisions . any one of which was sort of understandable at the time . 
uh , but on the whole i think it , uh , probably was the wrong thing to do . 
how about you ? 
well , when it ended . 
ended up being , 
i was in the last lottery . 
and i was glad it was over by then . 
i've never really totally understood what our purpose was over there . 
just because , you know , we didn't really do anything when we went over it seems like . 
you know , we , uh , 
those people that i know , 
i work with several that were over there , 
and for some of them it was just kind of , i don't know , not so much a holiday , 
i guess that's how they tend to talk about it . but that they just kind of lived out in the woods 
and ever now and then , they'd go and shoot their rifles 
and then they'd ,
and you know . 
but that they weren't really allowed to do anything . 
i , uh , 
to me it seems like we only went halfway . if even halfway . 
it's funny . 
tonight i was , uh , 
and i was thinking in the course of talking to him about it , how , uh , in world war two , the personalties of stalin , hitler and churchill more or less defined the war 
and actually when you think back on the big events of the war , uh , it was almost a personal struggle among these three , uh , 
i guess you'd have to call them great men in some sense . 
 uh , they're certainly all leaders 
pretty solidly behind each one of them . 
and i got a feeling that some of that was involved in the , uh , early decisions of the vietnam war . that the , uh , people saw the cold war as , uh , you had to draw a line and defend it . 
otherwise they'd get you someplace else . 
uh , a certain amount of resolve and willingness to fight , uh , brought the cold war to an end . 
but i don't think you can just fight anywhere just in order to , uh , call the bully out and beat him . 
and i have a feeling that that's part of what was involved in the vietnamese war . 
they felt like this was a place where we could draw a line ,
 and , uh 
but i , uh , you know , 
like i said , the more i hear about it , the more i can see each decision that was made as being understandable . 
but the accumulative effect was to really get into a hopeless situation where , 
and as you say , uh , going halfway was probably worse than , uh , uh , committing to a completely and , uh , winning it , whatever that would mean . 
well , uh , we weren't prepared for , 
i guess the best word would be the atrocities of war . 
uh , i mean the other wars i mean 
you knew who was good . 
you knew who was bad . 
and you know 
 well you're not , 
but in the vietnam war it seems like it was , 
the sides and the lines that were drawn are all confused as to who's good and who's bad 
it's ambivalent , 
it seems like even the people , you know , 
had the south vietnamese , the north vietnamese and , of course , the laotians 
and the cambodians weren't even supposed to be involved . 
what about the domestic effects 
like i was thinking that maybe the most important effect it had was to make it , uh , possible and even popular to , uh , criticize the government . 
and they , 
that pendulum started to swing , uh , maybe even too far . to the point where , uh , uh , supporting a government decision in foreign policy was sort of optional 
and that tradition is still , 
i mean it's dying now , 
but it's still alive as opposed to , 
 this  desert storm stuff may have , uh 
but i think that was one of the biggest , 
that , you know , the domestic unrest , 
are you in the middle of anything ? 
i've just , 
about the last thing i did 
about maybe , oh , close to a year ago now i guess , i helped my dad add on another bedroom on to his house . 
so , i guess that , 
the whole thing ? 
that was fairly large undertaking . 
it's a bedroom and a walkin closet and a bathroom all on one side of the house . 
did the framing and all ? 
that was the only thing we didn't , you know , putting the ceiling up and things like that 
we weren't sure how to do that 
and i did all the sheetrocking .
that's the exact opposite . 
we put all the interior walls up . 
we just didn't do any of the sheetrock wall work 
and that's it because you have , you know , get those joints to go together 
 and whatever you have to put in there to take the gaps out between the sheets 
we didn't know a thing about any of that 
and so , 
my wife wishes i hadn't done that . 
we figured well just , 
i didn't think we could do it and make it look professional . 
so , we left it to somebody who does it for a living . 
i think it takes about three or four times before it gets easy . 
probably so 
and i , 
but that's , 
i guess , i'm only twentyone 
so home owner's knowledge is not very much . 
so it's just what i have to do , more or less , around the house , you know , for my parents 
did you framed in new square footage 
it was brand new . 
brand new   .
we started with the backyard and turned it into part of the house 
so it was , 
you knew how to do the framing ? 
uh , well my dad knew how to do most of it , you know . 
we'd gotten a couple of books 
and then he just started doing it . 
i don't know . 
well he did all the flooring himself . 
he put the whole floor in 
and then i just started with the walls and the roof and started there . 
and then we not necessarily a garage , but just like a , off the side of that 
after we had the house part made , we just decided we'd carry the roof out a little bit farther and put a carport more or less . 
you know , it's not enclosed . 
it's just somewhere to drive another car to park 
and it's , 
uh , it's off the ground . 
on the piers ? 
it's on about 
you had those poured 
uh , no , 
those are , 
you just put forms in the ground and fill them with concrete ? 
so . it's , 
 well , the last thing i did completely myself was an outside deck which i was pretty proud of .
those are , 
i've done one , 
i helped somebody do one of those before . 
those are , you know , 
you can buy them in kits 
but we didn't do that way . 
but it's , 
i designed it from scratch and 
those are nice . 
they're pretty forgiving , you know . 
you can always tear stuff out and redo it . 
it's a , 
 that's not near ,
those are nice . 
especially when you get done , you've got something , you know . 
i don't know , 
i like them . 
you just sit down on 
that sounds nice . 
i had 
so we could pour concrete and support it with a nice firm four by four posts . 
a contractor friend helped me , uh , with some of the , uh , foundation work 
but , uh , it was pretty , 
it was about four or five hundred square feet . 
the same size as the addition that i just put on 
that's a good size deck . 
 so , yeah . 
it's , uh , not that expensive . 
i think it cost me three dollars a square foot and , uh , you know , no less than that . 
that's not , 
six hundred dollars all together . 
that's good . 
that's not bad at all . 
the wood  may  
it got surprising as to the fact that how much wood is , you know . 
to get good lumber it costs , 
i don't know about dallas , but it's not cheap at all . 
i was surprised . 
i'd be surprised if it wasn't , uh , cheaper where you are . 
it's probably more there . 
well , yeah . 
it probably comes from where you are . 
i'm not sure 
when i drive through that area , that's all i see is 
it's nothing but woods down here . 
i mean , i haven't , 
i used to live in dallas . in arlington , actually . 
but that was just when i was a kid 
so i don't really know what the cost of living is even like in dallas anymore . 
but i don't know , we're a college town 
so that doesn't help us out any . 
east texas . 
  we have , 
gas is a dollar twelve a gallon , 
my current project is a walkway which i'm building around the house and out to the backyard uh , you know , digging it out and laying sand and putting , uh , pavers on top of that 
that's a lot easier . 
you've got something going all the time . 
well , what do you think in terms of , uh , benefits ? 
well , personally , you know , i think , you know , 
of course i'm sure we're familiar with the exact same benefit package 
and i think that , uh , we've probably got one of the best around , you know , 
besides , they tend to offer adequate vacation , i guess . 
and the paid time off is wonderful , 
and , uh , one of the things that we were just talking about as a matter of fact this week at work was the coda plan that is offered 
and i think that is just a fabulous one , 
so . i don't know if you participate in that or not , 
isn't it great ? 
how fast that adds up , you know . 
well , i have to agree with that . 
you know , i was thinking about , uh , importance of benefits and that kind of thing , other than salary 
and i started thinking that over the years that importance has changed 
and i suspect that that's probably true for everyone . 
when i was much younger it was , uh , less important to consider retirement and less important to consider medical benefits . 
but as i grow older and my family grows , the medical benefits are more important 
and the retirement is more important . 
i had never really thought of it that way 
but i guess that's true . 
i'm still young enough that , uh , the vacation's real important to me 
and the paid time off is real important to me and that kind of thing . 
but , uh , you know , the book because of that , you know , 
now that i'm a hundred percent vested , you know , you kind of look through the book and see well , what does that mean and what is the pension all about 
and , you know , when you're , you know , in your , 
i'm only in my late twenties now , 
so you tend not to think about retirement . 
but , uh , it's , 
i guess now is the time to think about it , 
so . does t i have a pretty good retirement package , do you think ? 
and that's certainly one of the reasons that i'm sure that they've begun the , uh , coda plan . 
and i suppose if you're started with t i in your early to midtwenties , and happen to stay with them until you're sixtyfive , then you'll have a very good retirement plan . 
but i had another career first and then came to t i a little later . 
so it's not , uh , 
all by itself it won't be adequate for , 
it's not going to build up ,
so , i have to find a way to supplement that . 
well , they seem to make it so easy to save . 
you know , one of the things that we're doing which is probably the worst investment in the world , 
but i've got money coming out   to buy savings bonds , just coming straight out of my check . 
and it's probably not a great investment , 
but if i wasn't doing that the money wouldn't be being saved anyway , you know . 
i kind of have to trade off , you know . 
if you never see it you don't spend it , 
and it's , 
i understand though , 
uh , believe me , i do that myself . 
do you ? 
and i disagree with you . 
i don't think it's the worst investment ,
do you really not ? 
i debate about whether it's really good or not , you know . 
well , it's , in terms of guaranteed return on investment 
and maybe you don't start looking for that word guaranteed ,
uh , it's shown a history that , uh , sure beats anything else .
that's true . 
that's very true . 
we went , uh , and did like a financial consultant type thing here in dallas 
and , uh , one of the things that we talked about with the counselor there was , you know , 
they work up this whole big , you know , all the things that you need to work on and you need to do . 
and then one of the things that we talked about with her was , you know , the need to save for our son's education . 
we have a two year old , you know , 
and , you know , we can't start saving for college when he's sixteen , you know , 
we have to do that now . 
and uh , they have a way that they can figure , you know , what , you know , 
and he's two now , 
in sixteen years when he's ready to go to college , this is how much it'll cost , you know , 
and it's just really scary the thought of how much it's going to , 
what it costs now is ridiculous , 
what it's going to cost sixteen years from now is just really scary . 
and they sat down and figured up that we needed to save like between fifteen and seventeen hundred dollars a year at a , oh , you know , six percent interest rate , to be able to have , you know , money for his college . 
and that's exactly what we have coming out in saving bonds , is , you know , about fifteen hundred dollars a year . 
so , i guess it , you know , 
in that way , at least we know that that's taken care of , you know . 
we can worry about other things 
i understand ,
is it really ? 
except that mine are a little bit older 
all this is going to do is give you a little spending money while you're there . 
you better make sure that you've got a scholarship . 
that's right . 
that's right . 
well , that's what she said to us . 
 and our answer was , that , you know , we will have enough money available for him to attend a state college . 
and if he wants to go to a private college , he can get a scholarship to attend , you know . 
and that was kind of our view on it . 
it just costs too much , 
you just can't do it , you know . 
so , i don't know , 
i don't , uh , 
it just amazing , 
it amazes me how much the costs are going to go up over the next ten or fifteen years . 
i just don't know how anybody's going to do it . 
and boy , it gets really scary when you start talking to them . 
oh , goodness . 
i applaud that . 
i think that i probably want to be a veterinarian . 
let me explain to you how you get scholarships  ,
that's right , 
that's right .
well , you know , you know , t i offers some good stuff 
and then i mean i think there's some negatives , 
but there's going to be some negatives anywhere , you know , no matter where you go . 
i have , you know , all , 
this is the first really large company i've worked for . i've 
always been involved in little small , you know , owned firms 
and so i've never had the big benefit package . 
so , i really don't know how to compare it to other big companies , you know . 
what they offered . 
so , i've been real pleased . 
well , that's fantastic , 
and on whole i would say that they're equal to , uh , most of our competitors . 
think so ? 
uh , i can see would not cost very much but might , uh , make things a little easier .
and you can pick what you want 
and , yeah . 
now it's up to you 
it's menu selection , so ,
that sounds really good . 
i read a thing , 
i don't even remember if it was in the dallasite or the insite one , about uh , companies allowing you , 
and they said that t i was looking into it , to purchase extra vacation days . which i thought sounded like a good idea . 
you know , if you've been there , you know , under five years you get two weeks of vacation 
 but that's really not enough 
and you want an extra week , then you can purchase an extra week of vacation by saying , okay , i'm going to want an extra five days this year 
and they'll take a set amount out of each paycheck , you know , 
and they're deducting it all along , 
so you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time , you know , 
you're really not being paid for them , 
the money is actually coming out of your own pocket , 
but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once , you know . 
so , that is kind of an idea that a lot of people sounded like that they were really interested in 
and t i said that they were looking into something like that 
well , i could certainly , personally stand seeing them go to a standardized compensatory time 
and i don't believe any of us would have to purchase any extra vacation days ,
uh , and i would certainly support something like four to one or five to one 
or , you know , maybe they want to get generous and make it three to one .
but it should be a standard uh , that's running in each department . 
and , yeah , 
 and a lot of that is left up to whoever your supervisor happens to be and what type of relationship you have with that person 
and , you know , i see a lot of differences , from one group to the next , you know , about who gets it and who doesn't get it , you know . 
and that's that way with a lot of things , you know , there . 
it seems like , it depends on what you're going to get and what you're not going to get 
well , that's for sure . 
which is the same , 
but then it's probably that way anywhere , you know , 
oh , i'm sure personalities always come into play . 
uh , just in this size of organization , 
our community doesn't really have any organized recycling drive . 
where do you live ? 
i live in san antonio . 
well , uh , i live in garland 
and we're just beginning to , 
we just built a real big recycling center ,
but , as far as , uh , trash pick up and stuff that a lot of the communities are doing ,
so , they're really not full force into it , 
but they're trying , 
so we're attempting it , 
but i wish we could do more . 
there's been no emphasis on recycling at all in san antonio . 
i used to work for the power company here 
and there was discussion for a while about , uh , building a garbage burning , uh , 
but it just wasn't cost effective , at the time . 
and little recycling trucks and things throughout the city 
but there isn't any , uh , advertising campaign . 
there's just not any push to recycle . 
i recycle my newspapers and , uh , my aluminum stuff . 
that's what i do . 
but , uh , they make it as hard as possible , 
it's not very convenient to do . 
when they put centers and stuff like that . 
well we have those , uh , which i think is one of the best things is those cash for cans . 
i don't know if you all have those things around . 
and i really like that because that makes it real convenient because they're in almost every shopping center , 
and you can just stop by . 
now everything else like the uh , paper and plastic and stuff you still have to go to the centers 
and i started doing that at work . 
um , i put out for people to put their aluminum cans in , 
and that's really helped a lot , 
i mean , everybody's pitched in 
so , i really like that , 
but , people are really concerned , 
it's just that sometimes it's not the right people ,
at work we started , uh , all the recycling stuff . 
they're really trying , 
i think what started it at work was that planet earth thing we had last year . 
and , uh , that really , started a lot of stuff off , 
but , you know sometimes it dwindles down . 
where i work now we recycle all the computer paper . 
that's good . 
but that's about the extent of it . 
well that's , uh , 
at least your trying something . 
it's just yeah , 
it would be nice if it could be more . 
and i'm sure that the , uh , driving factor for recycling the computer paper is that we get paid to do so . 
oh do you really . 
we sell the paper back uh , to a paper manufacturing company . 
well that's a neat idea . 
well , it defrays the cost of buying the paper , i think . 
not by much , but it does defray it some . 
enough to make it worth our while to have several bins through out the building . 
well that's really good , 
i mean at least they're trying . 
i know a lot of companies that waste so much that , 
i'm even trying , 
you know that was one thing we noticed last week that we had some new people move into our building 
we're trying to cut cost and everything like that , and recycle and all that stuff 
and here we are wasting . 
and i don't understand , sometimes , the logic behind it . 
well the last time , uh , someone moved offices in my building 
and , uh , the , uh , properties people came in with the good cardboard boxes . 
not the cheap ones of course .
i took several home because i'm moving pretty soon 
and they're good boxes . 
that's exactly what i did . 
and they were just going to throw them away . 
exactly what i did , exactly . 
because i didn't want to waste that . 
and it's hard enough to find good packing boxes   .
and these boxes are , 
you can unfold them . 
so , you know , they don't take up much storage space . 
exactly right , 
well that's very good .
i felt a little guilty about taking the boxes for about two seconds until i realized they would be thrown away , 
i thought , well i was doing them a favor by taking them . 
i found uh , about nine of them that had not even been folded into boxes ,
so many people go to the grocery store and stuff and get those boxes ,
the ones at the grocery store , half the time , they've pulled the lid off 
so you can't use it anyway . 
and the real sturdy boxes that copy room paper comes in , with the nice lids . those get thrown away . 
and i am constantly scouting out the copy room for those boxes . 
that's exactly what i do . 
those are perfect boxes to put files in . 
they're good for storage and stuff like that . 
that's what i do with a lot of my daughter's things is i'll store out of season clothes in them 
and they're just perfect . 
what i've done in the past , 
i don't have any now , 
but i would buy some cheap wallpaper from somewhere and cover those nice boxes with the lids , 
and you can stack them up and leave them out and put things in them , even . 
and they look just as good . 
that's a smart idea . 
i think i'll have to try that . 
that's really cute . 
well , you know , it's cheaper than going and buying the kind at target that are all ready with the little design on them or whatever . 
they're the exact same thing . 
that's all they are , 
they just made them look fancy . 
you saved me some money . 
and you're recycling .
well that's neat . 
well do you all have , uh , 
we have places that , uh , pay for paper to recycle , 
i know you do yours at work , 
but for newspaper . 
but ours are real hard to find . 
that's the one thing that really discourages me . 
you know , i recycle paper , 
but they , 
it's almost like they don't want the paper , because they don't pay , at all , 
i mean , they're real hard to find the places that pay . 
and that's really discouraging . 
i mean , i just go ahead and take it to you know , they just accept it . 
but uh , i think they should 
if they want people to recycle i think it's , uh , you know , 
like the aluminum , you know , 
it gets people uh , doing it , you know , 
you don't have to pay them a lot . 
i live near a walmart 
and there's a big , uh , uh , huge dumpster looking thing sitting out front , 
in fact i think there's two of them , that have several openings , 
and it's for recycling 
and they have aluminum and newspaper and plastic and some other category , 
i don't , 
maybe there's two for aluminum . 
and you don't get paid 
but it's real convenient just to chunk the newspapers in there . 
well that's good . 
the one thing i don't like about the newspaper also is , uh , 
like at work we have two different trash cans at your desk . 
you have one for paper and one for just your normal trash , 
but uh , in the paper one you have to separate . 
you have to make sure you don't throw away any of the slick paper , like magazines . 
you can't throw any of that away 
and you can't throw certain file type things away , 
and i just think it's such a hassle , 
it seems like it would be easy to take it all , 
i don't know , 
of course , i don't know all that about recycling 
but i do get tired of having to separate paper , you know . 
it gets to be , uh , 
i guess you have to make it a habit , 
i mean , you have to get so used to doing it that it's a habit . 
and we had , uh , a write up in our paper , uh , this last time at work about , um , 
they come and empty your trash every other day they do your normal trash 
and every other day they do your recycling trash . 
and somebody was writing in complaining that the people had , uh , dumped all the trash in the same bin . 
and when they were questioned about it they said well , we're running late , 
or we didn't have time to do those bins or something 
and that's real discouraging . thinking you're sitting there working to separate it 
and then they , 
and someone else isn't going to take the time to put it in two separate bags . 
so they're really , trying to start keeping an eye out for those , you know 
talking to the people again about , you know , 
separate them 
because that is discouraging when you do that .
it was hard to get used to those two different trash cans . 
but luckily that will all get straightened out 
they'll start separating them . 
because , i don't mind doing that , 
i feel like i'm uh , doing something for the community when i'm doing that . 
but anyway . 
well , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
you too . 
well , i , thank you . 
where to start . 
i haven't had that much , of course 
i just heard , 
but i haven't had that much time to think about it , either . 
i guess the , uh , biggest thing i find is the financial 
that's true . 
i didn't think about that . 
and , uh , of course  flying   , uh , 
using your social security number , of course , permits people to do that 
 and almost anything you do now , a social security number is required . 
and , uh , of course there's another aspect of this , too , uh , in terms of invasion of privacy 
i just thought about it , 
being a professional of course , you probably belong to one or more professional organizations , 
and that is that 
some of the organizations sell their mailing lists 
i agree .
i get some of these things in the mail that i wonder , where in the world did they get my address or where did they get my name .
and in fact , some of these things i get , some of these questionnaires , 
it's funny because i was in the process of filling one out when i decided i would make this phone call , 
but  , uh , i haven't got to the end of it yet where it asks all that salary information and everything , 
but , when you have to send that back in the mail with your name on it , your salary information , i just have a real hard time doing that , uh , 
and they ask you what type of household items do you own , like stereos and t v s and v c r s 
 and you hate to send something off with your name and address 
and what types of things do you own 
and what kind of money do you make 
and you wonder , well , who's going to get ahold of this and think , um , that's a nice place to go rob .
and not only that , it opens you to phone solicitations 
i got one tonight about six thirty when i sat down to eat dinner , 
carpet cleaning .
i've had them for carpet cleaning , 
i've had them of course , for , you know , real estate investments 
 you know , you get , uh , please send in uh , you know , this particular card and you get , uh , a free trip or something along those lines . 
and so , of course , i enjoy being at home and i do not enjoy getting called by strangers 
so , having your , 
and i know that a lot of these , of course , are random phone calls 
they just , you know , start going through the phone book or going through a series of numbers , 
but some of them are sold , 
and i know you 
talking about mailing lists , the  , 
there is one particular group to which i belong 
and for some , 
the reason they have three different names 
now the address is the same 
but they have one under , you know , my first name , james . 
they have one under my first name and 
then they have just my two initials . 
 , and i get mail 
oh , no .
so i know that they have sold their mailing list . 
and , uh , i think those two things bother me more than anything else 
and , uh , i can't really think of anything else offhand , that , uh , 
i think i dislike the phone number part the worst . 
i mean , you can just put it right in the trash , 
but it's the phone calls , 
and , you know , usually when they call you , it's going to be they pretty much know that you're at work all day 
and they call you right when you've just gotten home from work . 
the last thing you want is a phone call unless it's , you know , something halfway enjoyable , 
but if it's a salesperson , it's just something you don't want to have to mess with . 
 and i've gotten a lot of them lately , 
or i'll , 
sometimes i come home from work 
and there's a lot of hang ups on my answering machine 
and i'm just assuming it's probably a salesman that called during the day 
and , i wasn't home , 
and they'll probably call me up and , you know , call me back and bother me when i sit down to dinner later on , 
yeah , you know , 
it's kind of irritating , 
but it's not nearly as obnoxious as the phone calls . 
i think you mentioning the phone calls during dinner , 
i know when i sit down with the family and want to have the opportunity , to talk 
even if friends call 
so i try to , 
i actually during that period of time you know , usually from six o'clock or six thirty , whenever i get home , until eight or so , i will shut off the phone 
 and , uh , my daughter gets irate  ,
uh , oh . 
 so she'll , you know , 
i agree with the phone , too , in that , i'm single , 
but when i come home from work , there's times i need to pay bills , 
i need to balance my checking account , 
i need to do all kinds of different things like that , 
and even though it's friends calling , sometimes you just feel like , this is my quiet time , 
i need to get things done 
and the phone ringing bothers me , 
but that's where answering machines are nice , because if it's really important they'll leave a message 
and i can call them back .
that's right . 
but , uh , at work i have so many phone calls from customers calling in , 
sometimes it really does annoy me . 
and , uh , if i've had a lot of phone calls during the day occasionally when we have , uh , 
like this past week , 
we have to do a lot of troubleshooting when the programmers have installed a new system , 
and , uh , phone rings like crazy 
and you come home 
and the last thing you want to do is have to answer the phone . 
and if it's some salesman , that just makes it even that much worse . 
and , uh , it just , 
i get to where i turn the answering machine on and just let it pick up the phone , 
but now with this thing i'm participating in , i kind of have to answer it , because you never know if it's the switchboard or if it's , uh , you know , somebody calling that you really don't want to talk on the phone . 
well uh , at the office . 
now what i have done is , i have forwarded my home phone 
a ring at all . 
oh , huh . 
that's an idea .
uh , to the office . 
and so you know , it makes it convenient . 
but at the office when i , you know , 
uh , on our system , and i imagine on most systems you can just route it directly to the answering service . 
ours is that way , too . 
and when i want to be , you know , not bothered during the day , that's exactly what i do . 
and so , uh , 
well , yours is probably the same as ours . 
it's , uh ,  tigon  
 , isn't  tigon   , uh , part of g t e or vice versa or something like that . 
seems i read , 
that's it , 
that g t e had purchased  tigon  
that's what we have . 
except we call it aspen . 
 and , uh , we , 
i couldn't remember in  tigon  had purchased g t e s phone mail services or if g t e had purchased  tigon  .
i knew there was some type of a tie in there . 
i remember reading in the paper a few months back 
g t e purchased  tigon  .
and so , we the aspen service before they purchased  tigon  
 so i imagine we will be , uh , shifting over to that service 
oh , no . 
that's good .
all right . 
but , uh , 
well thank you for calling . 
sure , good talking to you , jim . 
all right . 
take care . 
oh , i honestly don't feel like it's strict enough in my opinion . 
applied at all . 
so , i , 
how do you feel that it should be applied ? 
well , i just feel like there's a lot of murderers and rapists , and everything else , just walking the streets . you know ? 
and that , the penalty ought to be out there , and be enforced ? 
not getting paroled , let's say in so many ,
i mean , if your going to sentence somebody , let's say twenty years , let them stay twenty years . 
i agree with that completely . 
i know we don't have enough prisons , 
but there has got to be some kind of punishment ,
there has , 
that's right . 
because if they turn around , they get away with it , 
and they get away with it , 
and then they do something worse 
 and they get a slap on the wrist . 
they get ,
 and they final get up to where they kill somebody else , 
and they go through fourteen appeals , and 
that's right . 
and it's , 
well , they certainly are living off our ex , 
uh , they sure are 
 i didn't   , 
it seems like , really   a rough time 
 you know ? i'm not saying innocent person , 
let's say someone wrote a hot check , for instance . 
you know , really seem like it's a rough time for them 
he's just there to serve his time , and get back out on the street . 
that's what people face with that choice . 
one thing i really hate , is they don't explain to the jurors , in a capital murder trial , or in cases of rape , or in different things that are so horrible , what it means when they sentence them to , you know , 
they'll sentence them to ninety years 
that should be life , 
but , instead , in 
given the choice of either sentencing to death , or sentencing to life , they'll give them ninety years in prison or something , and then turn around in thirty years , that , you know , 
and less they're out . 
if they're even in that long . 
or they appeal , 
and then they get an appeal that says it was , you know , an unjust amount of time ,
time , uhhuh . 
i would just be , 
i would love to see them just really get real strict on parole 
i'd like to see the death penalty more as a deterrent , 
i think people know that it doesn't , you know , 
it's not a deterrent right now , because it's not really effective . 
there's should be , you know , for this crime , this is the penalty . 
you killed ,
you get ,
this is what's going to happen . 
and , i mean , it sounds horrible . 
i hear myself saying this , 
 but , i ,
but it's , 
i know . 
because they let them back out again , 
and they do the same thing over ,
same thing , 
then they put them back in jail , 
and they get out , 
 and these guys just are on the endless merrygoround in the legal system . 
and it's like i said at our expense . 
uh , a lot of people really doesn't think that much about it , because it hasn't happened to them , which it hasn't to me either , you know ? 
but still , it could . 
i know , 
you read about it in the paper ,
 and they just get away with it , 
and nothing happens . 
and as far as the other states , i honestly don't know what their capital punishment is . 
you know , i , 
and i know california had it for a long time , 
and then they , uh , took it off the books , 
they repealed it 
 and people like charles manson , and some of these other people , who were sentenced to death at the time they repealed the death penalty , were sentenced to life in prison ,
the people who were there originally , and are now coming up for parole , 
some of them ,
it's been denied fortunately 
i mean , you know 
well , the jury that sentenced him , sentenced him to death 
 and then while he was on appeal on his thousandth and one appeal , the state of california revoked the law in the early seventies , 
and then they reinstated it later , 
but the penalty didn't go back . you know ? 
it seems like a lot of times the law and isn't protecting the rest of the people . 
the victim is really , seems like left out in the cold , more or less , doesn't it , 
well , especially in things , you pick up the paper , 
and the laws are all , the rules . 
some of the things that would make sense criminal history , you know , where he's raped ten women 
 and then he gets up for this one trial , 
and they don't finds anything out about the facts that he's done this over and over and over again 
 and so they say , well , this is , you know , 
i don't know if they say it's the first time offense or whatever , 
but they give him a lighter sentence , thinking he's not a habitual criminal . 
or , you know , plead insanity . 
yeah . well , 
to some extent if they would do something with some of those people . 
but that seems to be a good way to get off for a lot of them too . 
oh yes , 
they plead insanity 
 and then three years later they're cured , and let loose on society again . 
it just , 
i mean , 
i know , in the dallas metroplex area , i don't go out hardly if i don't have to at night by myself 
 and i grew up in a smaller town in texas , 
and it wasn't that way when i was younger . 
well , like i ,
we could go around , 
boy and , 
but , uh , even the small towns now though , has really changed from when i was a kid , 
but now i'm raising children . 
it really is . 
you can't even , 
when i was a kid , i would run between my neighbors , three and four blocks sometimes , as long as my mom had a general idea where i was 
and now i don't let my kids out of the front yard , that i can't see them . 
it really is . 
but i've enjoyed talking to you . 
well , good talking to you too . 
now the term personal computer , uh , 
i don't happen to have one at home . um , 
but i do have a personal computer on my desk here . 
a type of work station ? 
uh , yeah , 
and , uh , it works just fine . 
it says it's a monochrome monitor , panasonic printer , uh , no big deal , 
it does the things i need for it to do . 
is it a two eightysix or three eightysix base machine ? 
it's eighty eightyeight ? 
uh  , what type of , uh , utilizations do you make of it ? 
word processing obviously . 
uh , yeah , 
i do that , 
i do , uh , some lotus on it . uh , do some , uh , samna , some , uh , p f m , uh , nothing extremely complex . 
uh , i use them both here at work and at home . 
and i have i b m clones in both cases . 
here at work i have the t i one thousand which is a three eightysix base machine . 
oh , yeah . 
i bet that's a pretty nice setup . 
it is . 
uh , unfortunately i need all of it . 
uh , for example , i was messing around with a spreadsheet this weekend that's a third of a meg in beta size . 
and i know that , uh , brings an eighty eightyeight machine to its knees because  , i had taken it over from a friend who was working on it 
and he had a two eightysix machine , 
and it brought it to its knees .
and then i have , uh , a three eightysix f x a sixteen bit machine ,
and i'm really pleased with it . 
it manages to take care of all my home needs in terms of word processing and spreadsheets and ,
uh , what i've gotten into more recently are the tools to use them . 
have you , 
to try to make them more effective and useful . 
have you been , uh , struggling along those lines ? 
well , um , i seem to always be in the next to the last generation of word processing software . 
when everyone was in samna i was still in p f m , 
and now that i finally become proficient in samna everybody's going to wordperfect . 
so , i can never quite stay current with that . 
well , i think you will be real pleased to get away from the banana as i used to call it . 
it's , uh , 
i used it on , uh , some other machines in days gone by and was real pleased to leave it . 
it was a real memory hog when you started making large  blot  changes to it . 
at least the version i had tended to keep copies of that .
i can bel , 
very frustrating . 
uh , but again i've been dealing with large files both data and otherwise . 
uh , that was a engineering spec on b two . 
you come here with the b level of specs ? 
i'm not that up be on that sort of thing . 
well , it's just a huge file that tries to describe the requirements of what you're trying to build .
oh , okay . 
oh , okay . 
oh , well , it sounds like you're pretty much into computers . 
uh , there's no way that i could begin to process and keep up with the kinds of information or the magnitude of information that i need to try to do my job without them . 
i can believe that . 
well , it's been interesting . 
yes , uh , 
maybe you'll play around some and figure out how they can help you do different things . 
i think that's when you start deciding that you really need greater assets than you already have . 
when you start seeing what all they can do for you . 
of course , needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing . 
well , i understand that  , you know .   
if , needs and wants were the same i'd have a four eightysix machine at home .
i wo , 
is that the newest thing now , the four eightysix ? 
that must be a fairly recent release . 
uh , that's , 
because i had done capital packages for two eightysixes and three eightysixes , 
but i didn't know they had a four eightysix just yet . 
it does a few more things ,
but i'm not sure that it's such a massive improvement . uh , you know , 
once you get passed thirtythree megahertz , all help is , kind of lost in the translation .
i enjoyed our discussion . 
i did too , 
and you have a good day . 
you do the same . 
ladies , first . 
oh , no . 
well , i don't find a lot of time to watch t v . 
and a lot of time , i find it during the day when i'm rocking my little girl to sleep , 
so i watch a lot of reruns , old shows ,
i really enjoy watching andy griffith . 
well , some , 
so your a homemaker ? 
i guess , that's , the right term nowadays . 
i stay home with two kids . 
my wife , 
we have a new one in the house 
and she stays home , too , also . 
um , i guess , i have a wide variety . 
i like watching the t v for things that are interesting , 
not so much the things that aren't , 
for example , like the cosby show to me is just kind of like a waste of my time ,
but i like sixty minutes ,
of course , i have to watch cartoons on saturday morning , but not the ninja turtles . 
i like the oldtimey ones ,
you sound like my husband . 
he likes tom and jerry and , uh , bugs bunny and all his friends .
johnnie quest .   the good ones . 
um , now if i'm ever home during the day on a vacation day , i have to catch at twelve o'clock the andy griffith show , because i usually , 
uh , but i don't know , 
it seems like nowadays everything is so electronic , you know , magnified and animated ,
and so , uh , now  i do ,  with the cosby show , 
i have seen it a couple of times 
and , i do , 
i like the show . 
i just don't watch it .
but , uh , some of the crap that's on t v nowadays ,
i do watch the special shows that they come out with , the nova stuff . and , 
but , i think there's enough out there to pick from . 
i'm not , 
we don't have cable to the point of the h b o or any of that stuff . 
but , uh , 
and , you know , i don't want them watching something that i don't think they should watch 
oh , me . 
 and i watched that for like , oh , ten or fifteen straight years , 
oh , no . 
and then well , you know , i'd eat 
like at work , we'd have a t v or whatever . 
so i gave it up . 
fifteen years . 
bet they hated that . 
i had watched it since it started . 
oh , goodness . 
uh , now i don't know who the characters are , 
and , um , i'll turn it on every once in awhile 
and i don't recognize anybody , 
so i guess that's a good sign .
i used to watch , uh , 
i can recall , 
this might date me here , uh , 
i can remember staying home , when i was five and six ,
oh , yeah . 
well , see , you're probably about the same age as me because my mom watched the secret storm ,
secret storm . 
well , i think they were back to back ,
 i was  just a youngster 
we used to , 
my mother watched all that stuff , too . 
and i think as the world turns may ,
still be on . 
it was not too long ago . 
now they got a lot of other crap involved . 
and so , 
you're right . 
i think some of the tones of the daily prime time is questionable , 
and that could be , uh , 
i have to agree with you . 
you know keep them on the channel twenty one . 
we do , 
and it's real interesting , too , the difference in my kids , 
like um , my oldest loved sesame street ,
my younger one doesn't . 
she's more into walt disney kind , you know , 
we watch a lot of movies that we've got on tapes , 
she's more into the animated stuff , where my other daughter liked puppets and that kind of thing 
well , sounds like you got your hands full there , 
and i do appreciate speaking with you . 
it was fun . 
have you gotten your catalog yet ? 
i just spoke with jim . 
and it inspired me to make more phone calls .
oh , well , see i don't really . 
i've had a few people call me , 
but , i've never made one . 
oh , really . 
i need to get brave .
that's what i need to do . 
have a good day . 
what are some of your favorite foods ? 
mine , well , 
i imagine in argentina you've got some great foods . 
well , we got , um , a lot of , uh , european dishes . 
we got what some people call the best beef in the world . 
so it's , uh , bishu  , 
like every sunday you go out , 
and you buy all these parts of the cow , 
and then you just cook them over a grill . 
like , in our house , it's already built in . 
there's this whole special place in the back 
so you can make a barbecue . 
i've had that meal in new york , uh , where they bring you a plank , sort of , with all this wonderful beef 
 and it's marvelous   .
and then . 
i have to find a place around here that has that . 
well , uh , they have an argentinean place down in georgetown . 
i'll keep that in mind , yeah . 
you serve that yourself , or for a family ? 
excuse me ? 
you ever serve that yourself when you have company ? 
oh , no , 
well , see , the problem is , i'm only twentytwo 
 but like when i'm down at home 
and i'll cook it . 
you know , like you have to prepare the fire , and then put the sausages on , 
and then , you know , you put all these different meats which take different times . 
do you buy them , um , separately at , you know , an american grocery store now , 
or do you have to , 
you don't go buy it from a wholesaler . 
but what happens is in argentina they have like all these little places 
and so . 
i've lived in mexico , 
so i know . 
and so they got the meat place . 
and so you just go there 
and , you can't find chicken there , 
you got to go to another place to find the chicken . 
you have poultry place . 
what dishes do you serve with it ? 
well , basically , it's , what we call it impenadas 
the turnover , 
the stuffed turnover . 
meat turnovers . 
oh , i love those , 
and , then we also put sausages on a bun , 
and then that's to start out with . 
and then what you have is also you know , like three different kinds of salad . 
and uh , that's about it . 
do you remember when you were in washington , sam the argentine baker ? 
uh , no . 
it used to be in georgetown , years ago . 
he moved , 
i guess he retired and went back to argentina , 
i guess , in the early seventies . 
oh , okay . 
so that's before your time . 
your parents might remember if they were here then . 
we were only there for two years . 
i mean , he was wonderful . 
we used to get the most marvelous impenadas and other 
and , uh , what i also eat now , since i graduate , 
i have an italian roommate , 
i'm italian . 
are you ? 
and being argentinean we also have a lot of pasta . 
yeah , well , 
and , you know , 
because there're many italians in argentina . 
and my mom , you know , like makes 
my grandfather came to the united states through argentina . 
oh , okay . 
this was around the turn of the century .
at one point , one third of the population of argentina was italian .
it's interesting , because when we cook here , 
i'm of italian descent . 
my husband is chinese . 
and we both love continental cooking , french cooking . 
so we cook , uh , 
our meals are , well , 
we don't usually mix . 
i mean , that sometimes 
 well , if we're entertaining we'll do a chinese recipe 
 and , um , there are really easy recipe 
that is , you know , with chinese you always have several dishes .
and nowadays with microwaves , 
you can steam many of the things in a microwave . 
i don't know if you have one . 
and if you like chinese food , you can take filet of fish 
and it's a wonderful 
is it ? 
because i was at , you know , 
it's like , when you go buy fish , you know 
 well like i buy like the fish 
so you can do it in the microwave 
and yeah , 
i've seen , you know , the filet . 
buy a fresh filet of fish , a nice one at the fish counter . 
what kind of fish ? 
um , any white fish . 
sole is good , uh , um , flounder 
sole or flounder is real good . and even grouper . 
so we put soy sauce and sesame . 
little bit of soy sauce and sesame seed oil . 
and , not too much soy sauce . 
uh , some chopped up um , you know , slivers of scallions .
and if the fish flakes , it's done . 
don't overcook it though . 
because i got , um , one of those little , uh , microwaves , 
the ones that take forever to boil a cup of water . 
well , you see , just check it , you know , during , 
it's that sweet chinese sauce ? 
well if you go in a chinese store ask for hoi sin , h o i s i n . 
wait , wait , wait , h , *[[three ?
h o i  , 
h o i , 
s i n , or s e n 
s i n , 
either way they'll spell it . hoi sin sauce . 
it's a very sweet dark , sort of a purplish plum sauce , purplish brown . 
and if you take , uh , little pieces of pork and you fry them , like little cubes of pork .
and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce , that you can serve over rice . 
 uh , uh , how much pork do you buy 
um , well , 
for two people , um , if you're just serving that , 
but if you're serving another dish with it , say the rice dish 
and then , you know , you could , 
i could probably go half a pound .
and you can always heat it up again , and save , you know . 
so , it's just , since i'm from argentina , i just love meat . 
and we , 
you can also do the same thing um , if you have ground beef . 
just stir fry the ground beef . 
drain off the oil . 
use the same hoi sin sauce and some of the frozen mixed vegetables . 
just stir that in 
and you've got a very colorful side , another dish . 
and how much does it cost ? 
um , the hoi sin sauce ? 
oh , a dollar twentynine a can . 
oh , okay . 
a can would serve you you know , for quite a few , um , meals , you know . 
i thought it was maybe you know , like five fifty or something . 
oh , no , 
it's not expensive at all . 
it's one of the chinese cooking basics . 
oh , okay . 
well listen , it was good talking with you . 
same here . 
hope you enjoy your recipe . 
all right . 
thank you . 
it's hard topic because 
is it doing a good job or a bad job 
and you got to divide it two different categories whether you live in the city or whether you live in a more rural place like i do . 
but you're excluding highlevel education . 
well , yeah 
i am . oh , 
higher level education , 
i don't think there's so much of a problem there . 
it's pretty much funded well . 
there are small colleges that i'm sure are struggling 
but , uh , it's the job that the high school and the grade schools are doing that i see , in a area like ours , 
our school , 
even a bad school is a good school up here , where , if i lived in new york city or washington , d c , uh , i would seriously consider moving if i had a child . 
i wouldn't let them go to a public school system there . 
but , of course , people are trapped economically 
and they can't do that . 
i know down here the schools are , you know , 
i don't know , 
they rate , 
i moved to arkansas and texas after living in ohio 
and the schools down here rate , you know , bottom ten percent across the country 
and having been through grade school up there and coming down here to high school i can understand why . 
because they're so far behind and so poorly staffed , half the time the teachers don't know what's going on . 
well , that's really too bad because it's giving some people unfair advantage . 
i mean our high school up here is like a junior college in florida 
what we learned . 
well , that was my experience going through junior high up there 
when i came down south for high school i was just repeating what i'd already done .
and , uh , you know , i'd been in a parochial school before junior high 
and , you know , even the public schools are behind the parochial schools . 
so , you know , i like the concept they've got now where they have more directed education , you know , 
you pick a career path 
or you get counseling earlier 
and then you learn the things that help you rather than spending four years learning the same things over and over . 
like they have that down there that , 
well , they talk about it 
and there are a few in some of the more , like in 
i live in a big metroplex 
and some of the suburbs that are richer have those kind of target schools . 
but , uh , you know , 
it's like if your father owns a grocery store and you're really interested in that , 
there's no reason that you should take college prep courses when you can get some 
or if you're going to go the science route you can go to a target school that specializes in science or art . 
you know , there's no point in , you know , 
i'm an engineering student 
and if i have to go take art classes , you know , i'm not going to use them . 
and through high school i could have gone so much further if i'd gone to a school that was directed . 
that's true . 
i was fortunate . 
i'm a technician 
and we had a vocational , uh , electronics in our high school . 
in high school . 
so when i went to my first year of tech school , i had a very easy time because our high school 
i think the schools today , you know , they're just overrun , you know , 
they don't know what to do , 
there's too many kids and not enough teachers 
and too many of the kids don't care . 
i find 
and the parents send them there because they're supposed to , 
plus it gets them out of their hair . 
and i also find that you can send a kid to school , 
but if don't work with them as a parent , i think you're putting your child at a big disadvantage . 
and , you know , there's some kids that , you know , want to go learn , 
but most of them just want to go play . 
or maybe they're unemployed 
and they're mad at the world , 
i can see where that wouldn't be very good for a kid , you know , 
i've had a terrible day . 
so , it's got a lot to do with economics in the area that you come from . 
that's true . 
i'm wondering with the boom down here . 
it's , well , not at the moment , 
but a lot of the industry's moving southward . 
are they going to move to , uh 
uh , i don't know about that , 
but a lot of the industry up in , uh , you know , the northern states is moving south 
 and i'm wondering if that's going to have any effect , you know , on what you see now . 
we're behind down here . 
on the , 
i say we because i live here . 
that might not turn around in the next , you know , twenty years . 
maybe they'll bring their good schools with them . you know , 
if the industry comes 
because i know the town that i come from uh , the large i b m plant has something to do with the top rated high school because of their tax base for one 
for the type of student that's going to that school , it's going to raise the level of the school 
you're most likely to do better in school . 
they're going to help you . 
you hope . 
well , i think , 
i don't know . 
i just think it's a duty of the parent to do that . 
i mean , jeez , my parents always helped me 
and , i don't know , 
it's just like you say , 
it's the way you're raised and the economic situation you're in . 
i can see some lady , 
she's twentyone years old 
and she's got four kids . 
a kid in , 
her first grader , 
i don't see where she's going to have much time for them . 
i don't know . 
it's just like , 
i guess you just have to wonder , 
is it up to the , 
is it , you know , 
the federal government , you know , 
where's the money supposed to come from . 
is it , you know 
i don't know . 
actually , i think it should be 
like , if the teachers are getting six percent raises every year when people in industry have been getting cut back , and you're getting 
we're in a recession here . 
are in the recession 
and they're , 
even though we've , uh , enjoyed very good employment here for the past ten years , 
now we got eight percent , uh , unemployment when it used to be four or five . 
starts hitting closer to home . 
but i always , see it's all money . 
like a couple other topics we had talked about was crime . 
it's all money based . 
and what you can do unless you just get down to the parent level 
and then if you're in a bad situation where you have to send your child to a bad school . 
who knows , 
maybe we need some more catholic schools , 
support the church instead .
they seem to have done a , good job in the past . 
in , uh , some places , uh , you couldn't go to a public school . 
it was miles down the road 
and the only school you could go to was the baptist school or the catholic school 
they're a lot more strict . 
i don't , 
you , uh , have to learn , 
you aren't given the chance to , you know , screw off all the time . 
i don't know if i would do that to my child , though . 
 so , pretty much , though , 
see , i don't have any good ideas or anything that would contribute . 
see , this isn't a subject that i think a lot about because i'm never faced with it because our school system in vermont , it seems to do a really good job . 
well , i know i'm in the , you know , 
the only reason i asked about secondary schools or , you know , advanced education is because down here , you know , going to the university of texas , the education i'm getting i think is kind of shoddy for a public school . 
is it ? 
i don't think i'm getting what i should , 
but , you know , in texas , it's next to free because they pay so much of it . 
it's state supported . 
well that , 
but at the same time it's not like going to m i t . 
my engineering degree will be nothing like somebody coming out of m i t . 
and it's really too bad 
 but that's , 
i don't know , 
i think it just builds on the foundation that they've already built . 
you get people out of high schools and junior colleges that don't have the background for an m i t kind of curriculum . 
so you have to go to a lesser engineering school . 
we have a very good public school up here 
and a degree out there means a lot . 
it's a very good school . 
it's university of vermont . 
uh , we also have some two year college . 
well , there's a four year colleges . 
they all have a pretty good reputation . 
but , like you say , you , 
well , uh , i think the weather lately has been a bit warmer than i would expect this time of year . 
i think that's true . 
uh , the bermuda grass is greening up in march , 
and sometimes doesn't really start doing that until the first part of april . 
i was out in my yard yesterday afternoon , 
and i noticed all that grass coming up , 
we've got to start this mowing bit soon .
that's true . 
it's been a fun break , 
but the break is over . 
well , um , oh , i guess another thing i've noticed , too , here lately is that even though we've had some pretty warm days , it's been awfully gray , you know , just , 
now , the last couple of weekends have been nice and sunny . 
but it seems like every time at work i look out my window it's gray .
well , yeah , 
but i'd rather have a sunny weekend than a gray weekend . 
oh , i go for that , 
in fact , i'm a little worried about this one coming up here . 
we have a long weekend 
and , it sounds like it's going to be a little bit on the cool side . 
i haven't heard whether it's going to rain or not . 
i think there's an eighty percent chance this evening , 
but it's supposed to be cleared out at least by noon tomorrow 
and then the rest will be without rain . 
well , that's good . 
but i think the highs are going to be in the sixties , and the lows in the forties . 
that's getting back to a little bit chillier . 
that probably is a little bit under what it is for this time of year . 
i think , 
i haven't seen the weather on the news in the evening lately , 
but i think the average high should be about seventy . 
i'm not certain either , 
but you're probably right . 
well , i like it when it's sort of a medium temperature , uh , maybe seventyfive to eighty , somewhere in there . 
i don't like it when it's too cool or too warm . 
i'm much more apt to get things done when it's at that sort of in between temperature . 
that's true . 
um , one of the remarkable things about the weather in the summertime here is that quite often the average daytime high of say ninetynine degrees is within five or six degrees of the all time record high . 
and what that tells me , is that the summer weather is very predictable , that it doesn't vary very much . 
i mean , any other time of year , that's not the case , because it could be very warm or very cold . 
as a matter of fact , i heard the weather the other day on t v 
and i think it was one day this week a year ago 
they said that we had a freeze and some kind of bad weather . you know 
it wasn't just a super bad storm , 
one of the weirdest things i saw , i think it was around this time last year was a twentysix degree lightening storm . 
oh , wow . 
you know , i was going into the grocery store , 
and a lightening bolt was almost directly overhead , 
and it was twenty six degrees out . 
that is pretty unusual . 
and you really take notice of it , too . 
that's right . 
uh , it probably was a lot warmer up high . 
sometimes they get those inversions , like when we had that twelve and a half days a few years ago that it never got up as high as freezing . 
the air temperature at five thousand feet was fifty degrees . 
the cold weather was just simply trapped along the ground and couldn't get away . 
i don't like that super cold stuff . 
i just don't move very well when it's that cold . 
i'm really enjoying this now . 
well , this has been interesting . 
yeah , well . 
not too challenging to the brain . 
 not a real in depth topic , but 
well you have a good day . 
are you a player ? 
it's been a while now .
has it ? 
i've , uh , oh , 
and we bought a house . 
we're about fifty yards from the golf course 
 but unfortunately the house is taking up my time . 
so uh , it's been almost a year , i guess , since i've actually , uh , swung a club for a purpose . 
i haven't played in about two years , 
and then i went out two weeks ago with the guys here . 
i work at t i . 
and i played in a tournament out there , 
and i shot a net fiftynine . 
they were kind of , little upset . 
i guess i laid off long enough to get rid of all my bad habits . 
i have a hard time inventing shots , you know . 
let's go around this tree , and 
and i can't do that 
i finally got out , 
and i've been watching quite a few videos . 
i had not been able to play 
so i took out a few videos and watched them for a while , 
and i hope i'm on the right track . 
shot a career low eightynine , and my handicap is twenty nine . 
that's great . 
i like that . 
now uh , like i say , it's been a while for me , too . 
uh , i've got my wife motivated about it , um 
 and , uh , i think that's probably going to be one of the next investments , is get her a set of clubs 
and , uh , we'll get out of the driving range and get some interest built up 
and hopefully uh , we can start in . 
i've tried to get my wife , 
i bought her a set of clubs four years ago . 
she hasn't even swung them , 
well , great . 
that's good , 
but , you know , i just like getting out , being in the outdoors , 
and i'm a hunter and fisher anyway , 
but , you know . 
same thing here . 
you know , at least i can get out and play a few hours of golf 
and it's not going to cost me an arm and a leg , really . 
and you know , i walk , 
i don't ride 
 you know , i get a little exercise there , too , 
i've got the same attitude . 
uh , i tell you , 
i started , 
i guess , the first time i played golf has been probably about eight or ten years ago now , when i was in college . 
and , uh , uh , i took it as a p e course and then kind of left it alone for a while , 
and then finally while i was still in school 
 and since then , uh , we've made it , um , 
a thursday , um , 
well , like a thursday night bachelor party and a friday golf day before the wedding . 
uh , so , it , 
that's back in south dakota where i grew up 
my main involvement , 
is it seems like i go home and play golf more than i do around here , 
but , uh 
and then i'll show them we can play golf in the middle of winter when we can't do it back home . 
it's pretty nice . 
we played out here a couple of times in the middle of the winter when my parents came down and what not . 
they were amazed . 
you know , here it is , sixtyfive degrees , 
we're out playing golf , 
and they're freezing cold back there , 
when i got into the service i got into it 
oh , okay . 
 and now when i come out here i just kind of let it go , 
and then one of the guys mentioned to me at work one day if i played golf . 
i've got my clubs , 
but i haven't swung them in quite a few years . 
and then i got into it and then back out of it , 
and it just seems like every couple of years i get back in there .
that's right . 
you know , i really enjoy it . 
it's really nice . 
oh , uh , that's got the same level of interest . 
that seem to be the hardest 
well , about , 
that's true of any sport , you know . 
if you want to play tennis , or 
you don't want to go out and get beat to death , 
 and people don't want to play with somebody that they are going to beat every time , you know 
 and , uh , 
and then , you know , we've got some guys here that they are , you know , four and five handicappers 
 and they don't like to play with me because i'm too slow for them , 
that's right , 
and you know , i've 
never yet have i walked up , 
now i've walked up a few times on the golf course by myself with nobody else to play with , 
and never yet have i met anybody on the golf course that wouldn't allow me to join their twosome or threesome . 
that's true . 
they are always friendly . 
that's true . 
sure , come on out , you know , 
and they don't mind if you make a mistake , 
you know , it's pretty nice and friendly out there 
that's so . 
 and you can't find that in all sports . 
that's absolutely right , 
and you can gain a lot of ground doing that , too , if , you know , 
you get in a rut if you do play a lot 
but you play with the same people , you aren't going to learn anything . 
after a short period , once you learn everything they've got to offer , 
you need to , 
but , uh , mixed doubles league , or something like that . 
oh yeah , 
   , we have one down here in the summertime . 
uh , it runs from like five o'clock to seven thirty 
and we play in the summertime out here . 
we get a mixed league in , 
and that's what i'm trying to get her ready for . 
it's going to start , well , when we change time back whenever that is 
and it will start then , 
and , you know , we had a lot of girls out there a couple of years ago , 
and they were just starting to learn , 
and , you know , they were shooting a hundred , hundred and twenty 
 but they were , you know , 
now they're down into the hundreds 
so , it won't take her long .
and it's something we can do together , 
so . well , she doesn't do much hunting , 
she could care less about that . 
she's does a little fishing , 
but , you know , golf would give her the exercise , 
she'd be outside , 
give her something to do that we both enjoy , 
it sounds like we've got real similar situations . 
to go pheasant hunting , 
and , uh 
and , uh , kind of the same situation . 
she's up in the house and talked to my mother the whole time we were out hunting and stuff , 
but , uh 
all right . 
and you know , it's a game that you don't , 
like bowling , you know , you feel bad if you bowl a hundred . 
but if you shoot a hundred in golf , you know , 
you don't have to be an expert to play , 
that's right . 
any novice can pick up a club and learn how to hold one and learn how to do it and do it right . 
so , you know , you don't have to be an expert in any aspect of it at all . 
that's right , 
well , yeah , 
uh , out of my game every time and put them together on one hole , then i do pretty good 
i keep rationalizing that well , you know , i can do it , 
i just got to do it all on the same hole , 
 and then it will get better , 
and you just keep going , 
and in the meantime , just enjoy what you're doing . 
it really works that way .
and you know when i first got back into it , i used to get mad because i knew i could do something 
and i didn't get it done . 
you know , 
i naturally slice anyway , 
now you know , the ball will go straight 
and i go 
but , you know 
and now i guess , you know , being in my forties , i just kind of mellowed out a little bit . 
i don't get upset any more . 
and well , that's great . 
well , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
well , you bet . 
i guess i'll go back to work . 
sounds like it . 
all right . 
see you later   .
well i haven't had too much of a chance to watch t v lately . 
so probably everything i going to say is kind of dated . 
well , i can understand that . 
it's that time of the year . 
my wife and i just recently moved into our house . 
so we're 
i guess , in the , 
since i got out of college , which was about five years ago , my t v viewing started to tend more towards , uh , documentary , news programs , things like that . 
something that's going to keep mu up to date . 
i've kind of gotten away from , uh , being a series watcher , having to keep up to date with , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
i think when you're in college you have more of a regular schedule 
that makes a big difference . 
so , yeah , 
i used to , 
when my kids were real little and i was home , i watched , 
where i was home where i watched things on a more regular basis . 
but right now , the last things i watched regularly was thirty something when it first came out . 
did you all ever watch that ? 
i have a hard time sticking with something 
you feel kind of left out .
but , um , right . 
i know , 
but i tell you what , um , 
we're really strict with our kids about television , 
and one night , couple weeks ago , it was just happened that we were exhausted 
and they wanted to watch , 
and we'll , you know , look at what you want to see . 
let's just turn it on and see what's on . 
we could not find anything that had any kind of redeeming value in it . 
i believe that . 
so , you know , it was prime time , 
it was , what , eight o'clock on a week night 
 and we have cable , 
and there wasn't anything on any channel , 
and the stuff that was on the prime , the networks , you know , a b c , n b c , c b s , was , 
it was just , um , dribble 
 you know , i mean , it wasn't even funny 
that's right . 
it wasn't creative , 
it was the worst i've seen . 
i mean , i have not watched prime time , week night t v , i guess in a real long time 
i know exactly how you feel . 
you know what i'm saying . 
that's right . 
kind of became numb . 
nothing surprised me any more seeing it on the t v , you know . 
and then all of a sudden , i started paying attention to network t v again , once in a while . 
right now we don't have cable . 
and it's surprising how much it's changed 
the whole moral situation , everything , is just gone one whole complete direction different . 
and we don't have any kids yet , 
but i feel the same way . 
it's really tough to find something that's 
 you know , you watch some of the cartoons , 
and kids 
none of it's probably damaging , lot of times . 
it's just , uh , like a necessary evil . 
i mean , when our children were younger , when they were like four years old , three years old , five years old , we just had sesame street 
and that was about it , you know . 
but now , in order to seem , you know , humane and normal , we do allow them to watch cartoons and stuff . 
oh , yeah , 
but it's , just one of those things , you know , 
you have to shut your eyes or not listen or something , because those drive you crazy , if you're in the room . 
that's right . 
i don't understand why , first of all , the public puts up with it .
well , that's true . 
it's hard to believe that nobody can be any more creative than that . 
that can't be the problem . 
it must be the marketing pressures , 
and , you know , their demographic studies that they do that show , you know , that everybody's i q has dropped dramatically or something . 
i'm glad you said it 
and i didn't have to . 
but that's the , 
i feel the exact same way . 
i sit and watch some shows , 
and i'm embarrassed for the people that are even involved in the show . 
i know . 
you know , why do you do this to yourself ? 
i know , 
i'm trying to think if there's anything i do , 
uh , i like stuff that's on great performances , 
and , we used to watch mystery quite a bit 
stuff i guess that mostly public , on public t v . 
as a matter of fact , you know when i was a kid , excuse me , my parents used to have , 
we had this rule in our house for every hour of regular t v that we watched , we had to watch an hour of public t v .
now there's an idea . 
that was just the rule . 
and if they saw us watching something , 
or there was some other , 
the children's program i think at the time was called what's new . 
so we had to give a little oral report before we could watch our program . 
that's pretty good . 
do you watch sports on t v ? 
are you a sports fan ? 
i can't handle it very long . 
but it's kind of like reading magazines any more . 
if half of the time wasn't spent watching commercials , it probably wouldn't be so bad . 
but , uh , it's , 
you're missing an awful lot . 
i'd see a game on t v than fight the crowds at the stadium . 
but uh , 
that's true , 
the traffic . 
but , uh , no , 
i don't sit down , 
i'll sit down for the big games , the super bowl , and the championship 
but i don't follow any team . 
i check the scores the next morning , 
and i know how everybody's doing , 
and that suffices me . 
i enjoy that , 
you don't have cable now , 
i was going to say they have a comedy channel now . 
but again you're in a situation where you're watching mostly , uh , commercials , 
and then 
you know what i did . 
there was a time there where i could tape things 
and then i'd fast forward through the 
saved a lot of time that way . 
it works , 
you bet , 
but , that takes too much planning . 
i don't know , 
if there's any series that i pay attention to , i try to watch cheers once in a while . 
now yeah , is that still real good . 
it used to be real good . 
it is . 
in fact , i think it's on tonight .
i just got in from outside , 
so i 
oh , okay . 
 so i'm kind of out of it . 
things like that , 
and i consider that fairly intelligent humor .
you can tell , 
they pick up the words every once in a while . 
isn't it such a long running program . 
yeah , 
they do have good writers for that . 
oh , that makes me think , 
do you watch saturday night live at all ? 
we try to stay up , too .
it's getting harder and harder . 
ten years ago wasn't so hard to stay up . 
you know , it was just automatic , too , 
no matter where you were you stopped and sat down and watched it . 
i think it's come around again . 
it's gone through cycles . 
it was , 
we stopped watching for a couple of years in the middle there , 
but we started watching again . 
but it's real different show than it was when it started . 
it's funny now , 
and it's better , 
but it's real different 
that's right . 
that's right . 
but you can't be outrageous . 
you know , if you keep that same format . 
there's only so long that you can be outrageous . 
that is for sure . 
well , i guess there are a few things around still 
but you have to hunt hard for them . 
sounds like you pretty much agree . 
been , uh , good talking to you . 
good talking to you . 
take care . 
you too . 
so what kind of cars are you looking at ? 
well , we've test driven the oldsmobile delta eightyeight 
and i have two kids 
and my fiancee has two kids 
 so we need a car that's big enough for six . 
and so i guess it was two weekends ago , we went , uh , car shopping 
we found something interesting at crest oldsmobile cadillac up there on central expressway 
that , uh , in addition to getting a new car there , they can get you a car that's new 
but it's been , uh , a demonstrator model 
oh , okay . 
so , they call this program cars , 
and they come ,
and it just seems to make sense to me to get the most car for your money to get something like that . 
that's a real good deal . 
in fact my dad recently got um , a pontiac , uh , believe six thousand 
 and he got a demo . 
and it's been a real good car 
 and it's like new 
 and it only very low mileage on it . 
and so i think he got a real good deal . 
of course , they're fully loaded usually . 
oh yeah . 
so i think it's a pretty good option . 
i think so too . 
are the , uh , oldsmobiles that you're looking at , are they the demos 
or they used , 
are they new .
well uh , now , they may be the demonstrator models that the sales reps drive around in . 
and then the cadillac is definitely a used car 
the guy said it'd been on the lot about thirty minutes . 
he says it'll probably be gone in a done , 
and it's probably gone by now . 
oh no .
those things go fast . 
uh , of course we can't consider getting a brand new cadillac , because those are twentyfive to thirty thousand dollars . 
but when they're three years old they're , 
the price already drops in half . 
so then it becomes , uh , more realistic . 
that's what i'm thinking about on my next car is do i want to get another brand new car because last two cars are brand new 
 or do i look for a used car that's maybe three years old that 
but i kind of worry about getting a car that's that new with low mileage on it because you wonder why did the person that owned it want to get rid of it . 
is it a lemon , 
that's right . 
that's right . 
well , you can reduce that risk by , uh , having the car checked out , 
i mean , you know , if you're going to look at fifty different cars you don't want to do this 
 but if you've narrowed it down to one or two 
and then you'll have a realistic assessment of what you're getting . 
about how much do they charge to do something like that , 
do you know ? 
oh , i'm thinking around twenty or twentyfive dollars . 
that's not bad . 
it'd be well worth it if you're considering buying a car .
i would think so . 
i would think so . 
well , it's kind of hard for me to talk about buying cars because i just got mine paid off about a month ago , 
and i , 
isn't that a good feeling . 
i just want to enjoy not having any car payments for a while 
that's right . 
but it's still in great shape . 
i have a mazda r x seven . 
well , what you can do is take your car payment and put it in the bank for three or four years 
 and when you're ready to get another car just pay cash for it . 
i just about could really 
if i continue taking good care of it , it's going to hold a pretty good resale value 
oh yeah . 
 and , uh , if i consider going the used car route and save up some money , i shouldn't have too much trouble at all . 
i would think that's true . 
could you hold on for just a moment ? 
that's fine . 
but , uh , i really enjoy the car i have now , 
and i do want to hold onto it and you know , enjoy it while it's not having any mechanical problems whatsoever , 
that's right . 
in fact it never has 
that's right . 
 and , uh , it's been kind of nice , 
and surprisingly enough after four years , i'm not tired of the car at all 
that's right . 
that's right . 
because one of these days i'll be getting a six seater probably too . 
so  , 
the first two cars i ever bought , well , uh , uh , 
i've bought three cars , 
and i've always bought them new . 
the first car i kept for thirteen and a half years 
the second car i ever bought i drive to work now . 
that just turned ten years old , 
and i've got a hundred and twentytwo thousand miles on that . 
so that's kind of in the way i've done things is to get things that are new and then keep them forever . 
my car is using two quarts of oil a week now . 
oh my gosh .
about a quart every hundred miles . 
oh , no . 
 but , uh , it runs fine , 
all you hav , 
it's just very thirsty . 
if i just keep the oil in , it seems to be okay . 
but , you know , that's a sign that i'm going to have to do something sooner or later . 
what kind of car is it ? 
it's a buick century . 
are you going to trade it in on this new one 
it's actually ,
 and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible 
so she's going to sell it rather than trade it in . 
that's probably the best thing . 
you lose four to six hundred dollars a trade in . 
or maybe more than that , as i've learned . 
oh really . 
well i turned around and sold it myself for fortytwo hundred . 
oh there you go . 
you can do much better . 
i'm glad you're taking care of it yourself . 
i think trading it in , they just use that as additional , 
they may give you supposedly a better deal on your new car you're buying , 
but they just , are going to give you that much less for your trade in . 
well that's fact . 
what i think . 
i think you're right . 
but strangely enough , i mean , the best bargaining i had made with a dealer on my car was also the same place i got the best price 
but it's a place in arlington , 
and i think , maybe , as you get outside the dallas area , 
i kind of , 
i bet you it's kind of what i decided . 
well , maybe because it's outside of dallas they are giving a little bit better prices , 
plus i was going through that t i fleet discount program . 
did you use it at the car shop place . 
oh , okay . 
i had gone over to texins 
and they had a little file where they said which dealers participated in the fleet program , 
that's right , 
and what you could expect , they said , you know , a five percent over cost 
so , i figured out a price based on that . 
that's good . 
but i guess i got a pretty good deal , because i went back to the town north mazda right off central 
and they just laughed at me . 
and i went the next morning to arlington , 
and they gave it to me for that price . 
and what's so funny , 
they took the car , i knew they were going to pull it from town north because that's where the white one was . 
is that right . 
so it was that same car . 
my gosh . 
well , unless you're selling car with hail damage and flood damage .
and you laughed all the way to the bank . 
and i laughed real hard when i took it in for the two thousand mile checkup 
 and , uh , that they required you to do . 
and i took it to town north , 
and sure enough i saw that guy , 
and he recognized me . 
and he kind of looked down and saw that car , 
and i'm sure he probably knew what was going on the very next day 
of course , when the place in arlington went and took the car 
that's right . 
and the next day they pulled the white car and took it to arlington . 
so i'm sure he knew .
such a deal . 
so i loved it . 
i sat there , 
and i just had the biggest grin on my face . 
i'll bet you did . 
it was kind of nice . 
well , dana , it's been really interesting , 
i appreciate talking with you . 
good talking to you too , don . 
have a good evening . 
good luck in your car hunting . 
thank you much . 
what kind of hobbies do you have ? 
um , mostly what i do , 
i do some crafts like it mentioned in the thing , 
and then i read a lot . 
i like to read , too .
i was trying to think of some while it was , uh , talking about it , 
and then i , 
it took so long for someone to answer , 
i started reading the 
but , uh , yeah , 
i'd say reading is probably one of my biggest ones , because it's the type of thing that you can do a little bit at a time , whereas , i would love to do crafts and stuff if i just had the time to do it 
i live in a pretty small apartment , 
and , uh , i would have to , you know , put stuff away . 
i have two cats , 
so i couldn't really leave it out if i was working on something . 
reading is a little bit easier to work around . 
you can pick it up and take it wherever you go .
that's right . 
i get too involved in reading sometimes that i neglect what i should be doing . 
that's true , 
i do the same thing .
you get so involved in what you're reading . 
what types of crafts do you do ? 
i do a little bit of woodworking , 
well , i used to . 
i don't have the equipment here . 
we moved to dallas about a year ago 
 and my dad had a lot of woodworking equipment 
 and i did some of that . um , 
here i've mostly done things that i can do strictly by hand , um , sewing and quilting and , um , 
things to hang on the wall . 
mostly just stuff that i can , you know , use right around the house 
i've been making a lot of quilts , well , not a lot , but several quilts lately . 
i enjoy , uh , sewing and needlework also . 
i've , uh , made some small things , cross stitch things . 
and , um 
and i used to do the latch hook rugs and needlepoint and things like that , 
and i still remember how to do it . 
it's just been so long since i've actually sat down and taken the time to do something like that . 
but i have recently done some cross stitch . 
and i enjoy doing that . 
it's just the same old thing , 
it's just getting the time to do it .
i've done some um , cross stitch , 
but i never count right , 
and i always have to either take it out or have my picture slightly off centered 
it never has worked out completely . 
it takes a lot of concentration . 
i mean , it was the type of thing , 
i was making some little things for christmas , 
and i also made a little thing for a baby gift , 
you must pay all attention to what you're doing . 
it is a lot more difficult than it seems like it would be . 
it took me , uh , quite a bit of time . 
it took a while to do . 
but , it was fun , 
i enjoyed it . 
the first project i started out one was a big one , 
uh , it was of a lady 
and she was kneeling , 
and it was about fifteen by twenty maybe . 
oh my gosh . 
and i , 
it was just too much to start with . 
and i still haven't finished it , because i stopped , 
and there were so many different shadings and colors , 
 and , it was just too much to begin with . 
and i think kind of discouraged me from doing much more with it . 
that's pretty understandable . 
and i've done some of the crewel and um 
but it doesn't have the specific stitches . 
anyway , it's a little bit more loose , and not quite as structured , 
and i like that a little bit better 
more like embroidery or something . 
i'm trying to think of anything else i do as a hobby . um . i don't even watch t v very much . 
i was tonight , 
but  , 
i was reading when you called . 
how about movies , 
do you like to go to movies ? 
and i have a v c r , 
so i like to rent movies , 
and , um , right now i have the movie channel , 
so i've recorded quite a few movies off of that . um , 
just , i've kind of got a collection going of tapes now , 
they always borrow a few of them . 
i was over there , 
they live in duncanville 
 and i was over there at easter , 
so they are always borrowing my tapes . 
but , uh , 
well we , 
i like to do , uh , stuff with plants . 
um , i have a lot of plants in my apartment , 
and i've got a pretty small porch , 
but it's , uh , 
i've got a few planters out there that i'll , uh , you know , 
in the winter time i usually plant some pansies in there , 
and then in the summer i'll plant petunias , 
or something that's colorful 
and like , that blooms a lot . 
i kept thinking that it was going to get cold one more time , 
but i think we're probably past that now . 
i probably should go buy some . 
i guess if i had a house i might enjoy gardening , some . 
i'm not real crazy about pulling weeds and things like that . 
it's the hard work . 
i like the planting , and watering is okay . 
it's so nice though when you have a nice yard full of flowers , 
it's so beau , 
i mean , we don't . 
we live in an apartment also . 
i've got a few plants here , 
but i'm not really knowledgeable . 
i feel real good if i water them 
and they continue to grow . 
so i enjoy it , 
but i'm just not experienced enough with 
i don't know too much about it either . 
mine's pretty limited to my little , uh , porch plants .
and then the ones in my apartment , half of which don't look real healthy , 
but i don't always get direct sun except in certain spots . 
oh , yeah . 
and so that's probably my problem there . 
have you tried growing any , um , like fruits and vegetables or anything ? 
i guess vegetables are like in pots and stuff ? 
and my other two pots are , 
they're pretty big , 
and i have enough plants in them that it takes up a lot of my porch area , 
so between that and the chairs and the barbecue grill and the fireplace wood ,
but uh , my dad used to grow tomatoes and things at the house . 
and i think when i was real little i probably had a finger in on that every time he did it 
but i've never really tried anything like that since then . 
well , i considered it last year 
and this year both , 
but i haven't done anything about it . 
so . i think it would be nice to just go out and pick some tomatoes off the porch . 
we get lots of sunlight here , 
and the porch is screened in 
and it's pretty large . 
oh , wow . 
so , um , i think if i just would be , 
if i'd do something , be motivated enough to do something , i think it would work out well . 
but there goes that motivation thing again .
well , i enjoy playing with my cats . 
i don't know if you'd call that a hobby , 
but i have two cats , 
and i gave them a bath tonight , 
so they're a little bit angry at me .
they didn't like it too much . 
oh , that's good , 
and it helps because its the time of the year that they're shedding a lot , and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine . 
and sure enough , boy the fur just came off like crazy once i got them 
oh , yeah . 
so , they're pretty content now , 
but they were mad at me for quite a while . 
they went and hid after they got dried off . 
well , i like animals , 
but we don't have any yet . 
we have a nine month old with another on the way 
 and we thought , well maybe when they're a little bit bigger 
or get into a house with a little more space . 
i'd love to have some animals . 
but i like dogs 
and my husband likes cats . 
so we haven't reached a real agreement on that yet . 
if we get a place where we can have both , it'll be great , 
but until then , 
i like both , 
but since i'm in an apartment , i don't think an apartment is big enough for a dog . 
to me , dogs need a yard , even little dogs . 
they just need a yard . 
cats can deal with being inside all the time just fine . 
but i just think dogs need to be outside , though . 
i agree with you . 
if we were going to get anything now it would definitely be a cat , or even a bird or a fish tank or you know .
now that's an idea 
with the small babies . 
that she can watch , but won't take too much care . 
because , you kind of , 
even a cat , you never know when they might bite or scratch or something . 
there not as likely to as a dog might , i guess . 
but with little ones , i'd be kind of scared  , to get anything that has teeth or claws . 
especially when they're not quite to the age of understanding that they're hurting , you know , 
they grab hold with both hands and then just jerk . 
oh yeah . 
and if i was a cat or dog , i'd respond probably by biting or something . 
i don't know . 
oh , yeah .
that'd be my self defense . 
out of good ideas for a hobby anyway . 
 oh , okay . 
well it was good talking to you . 
thank you for calling . 
all right . 
do you have any pets ? 
oh , boy . 
 sound  like us , 
we have , 
go ahead . 
um , we just got the dog less than a year ago 
so , he's still a puppy . 
oh , what kind is it ? 
he's a mixed breed , 
he's part collie , part shepherd , and part chow .
oh , so you    , 
the only chow he's got is his tongue . 
oh , he's got a blue tongue ? 
he's got little spots on them . 
we have two chows and ,  , which wasn't by my choice , 
but i was out ruled , 
 , but the dogs are mainly mine and my husb , 
but i just love them to death . 
was the guinea pig for your , 
so , anyway she enjoys her though , 
so that's what matters . 
but , um , our chows , we've had them , i'd say , right around six maybe seven years 
they're , um , registered 
and we've been breeding them . 
she's had about four or five litters . 
oh , my husband's always wanted a chow 
but i'm kind of concerned about , um , having cats ,
um , because we thought they would socialize easier , 
um , my husband had originally wanted an   
and his brother has an   
and he , so far he's bitten ten people . 
oh , man . 
and the people that he got the   from , used to have cats 
and they no longer have any other cats . 
it's telling , um ,  you know  
when um , we had a cat when we first married , no ,  took   , 
we had the cat first , 
and then we got , uh , the chow . 
and ,  , um , bringing them in as puppies they got along just fabulous with her . 
and , uh , you would think , you know , that they were all dogs the way she would  prance  around them and paw at their face 
and they'd just play 
and they never harmed her . 
so , uh , they got along great , 
now i don't know full grown dog . 
i wouldn't want to bring a cat into a full grown dog , 
but i wouldn't feel , um , hesitant about bringing a puppy in ,
i think they would socialize easier . 
i think , so , too . 
um , how old is your child ? 
she's a real   .
so , you had the dogs before you had the baby ? 
and i was ,  , not really concerned about , um , them harming her , uh , 
that we hear all the time is how you bring them up . 
and ours are real friendly , 
they're protective , 
but they're very friendly , and lovable , 
i mean , you think they're lapdogs . you know , 
they'll just come jump on your lap and want to have their bellies rubbed and everything 
what color are they ? 
uh , the female's red 
and the male is black . 
oh , i bet the black one's pretty . 
and , um , i was concerned about the female mainly , 
and as luck had it , uh , she had puppies the same week my daughter was born , 
so , it was kind of like , she had her babies and understood about , you know , 
about your baby . 
and that , 
and they let her tug their hair and get on their back or whatever 
and she's grown up with them and loves them to death 
and they love her , 
i think it's good for kids to grow up around pets ,
i do , too . 
but i think it really helps them to understand when they go to other people's houses 
and they have pets , 
i see so many times kids just , you know , 
they , mean to animals not really understanding that the animals have feelings . 
yeah , exactly , 
that or , uh , the other extreme , 
they're terrified of them 
and i hate that , 
and they shouldn't be , 
i mean , some maybe 
she's just like , um , a little hyper thing and just prances around and jumps all over everybody acting silly , 
and a lot of kids are scared of that .  which  i understand because she is , you know , a lot of movement and everything 
but when she calms down they're so scared of her 
that bothers me because she's the friendliest thing , 
she wouldn't you know , harm them at all 
and that's mainly people that have never had pets around their children , 
so , i think it's a good idea to have them . 
in the past , we've had birds , too , uh , like cockatoos .
now , ar , 
the cockatoos , are those the big ones ? 
we've had those , 
and those are neat , 
they're very messy , 
are they ? 
oh , a lot louder than a dog , you know , 
but the birds , it's hard to keep them from squawking or whatever 
but they were neat , enjoyable animals to have . 
well , we've thought about getting an aquarium ,
i think the cats would really enjoy it , um , 
with a lid , .
of course ,  , um , 
but so far we just   
and starting up an aquarium , 
we're , thinking about getting a saltwater , 
oh , yeah 
 and they're so , expensive to start up . 
they are , 
and in your ,   the luck of keeping them alive ,
the saltwater fish have so much more color 
and they're so , much more beautiful , 
i know they are . 
um , the freshwater tank's just , 
really to me there's , 
most of them really aren't that pretty , 
you know , i really don't care much for them . 
i don't blame you there , 
i think the saltwater are a lot more attractive than , 
i don't know , 
those fish are just beautiful . 
just so , 
like you have a little bit of ocean with you or something .
rather than just little fish . 
but i don't mind having , 
my daughter had  like a  little goldfish ,
and it finally died 
and that was neat , 
and they're , you know , 
she can't play with it , 
you can just look at it . 
you know , you can't roll around and tussle around with it like you can a dog or a cat 
a goldfish here because ,
and then my cats would knock it over . 
i have to be real careful about where i put things , 
if the cats will jump up on things and knock things over all the time , 
 oh , no . 
they're always up where they're not supposed to be . 
and that's hard . 
  that's just like kids , you know , 
they know that they're not supposed to do it , 
but they're going to do it anyway because they know they're not supposed to . 
that's right 
and they're so , independent . 
i love having them for that reason . 
and until we got the dog , um , it was real easy three day weekend or whatever , 
and now ,
that's right , 
that is hard . 
and , i , 
we knew it , 
but we never even thought that about when we got the dog 
he's so , cute , 
let's take him home . 
you know , and then the first weekend we had him in a two bedroom apartment , 
and my husband went out of town , and left me with the brand new puppy , 
oh , fun . 
and i had to work twelve hours that day , 
oh , no . 
and so , i left the dog locked in the bedroom 
and i put paper all over the floor . 
well , when i came home , i opened the door 
and there were chunks of carpet ,
oh , no . 
and he had tried to dig his way out from underneath the door , 
oh , no . 
oh , good . 
um , yeah , i didn't even tell the apartment manager ,
oh , okay . 
 oh , no . 
bless your heart . 
but with a puppy 
when we had our family dog growing up i was eleven or twelve , i think , when we first got him , 
and i wasn't really involved in the paper training ,
so , this was , to me , a whole new experience . 
it is . 
only it wasn't like cats at all . 
i wish it was . 
i wish they were in that instinct . 
but they don't . 
our only problem with our schnauzer , she's an indoor dog  ,
and , uh , we found , she's right at a year 
and we finally got her , you know , house trained and everything , uh , 
her only problem is trash . 
if you do not pick the trash up , you know , the container ,
i don't care how full she is , 
so , it's not like she's hungry , 
it's just she wants to get into trouble . 
my cats do that it . 
if i through anything away that's any kind of meat or anything ,
anything that they think is good , 
they'll get into the trash , 
and then it doesn't matter where you put it and where you hide it , 
and how tight you have the lid down on it , 
they'll get into it . 
i've come home many a days from work to find trash all over the kitchen floor . 
oh , i hate that . 
you shouldn't have left it there . 
i couldn't help myself . 
i just hate that when she does that , 
i just , oh , 
and she knows it's wrong , 
you'll walk in the door 
and she'll cower and go hide under the table . 
so , she knows she does wrong . 
but uh , she continues to do it , 
the problem that we're having with our puppy right now he's not   
he's actually not really a puppy anymore 
he's like sixteen months old , 
um , but he's still chewing . 
oh , is he ? 
um , the last thing he chewed up was , uh , when we  . . . 
all set . 
do you want to start ? 
sure , go ahead . 
uh , in dallas there's definitely a crime problem , 
i know it's , you know , worse in the larger cities . 
um , it's kind of a concern for me , 
in fact , at the moment i'm thinking of possibly moving to a new apartment 
and , uh , it's , 
i am single and female , 
you definitely are going to worry about the location , and , uh , you know , accessibility of people to be able to break in . 
i live on a third floor now , 
but , i don't want to be on a first floor where you can have problems with things like that , 
and , the , um , 
do they have many buildings that have security there ? 
it depends on the location . 
the area i live in right now , is real good as far as crime rate is concerned 
and we don't have anything at all , no burglar alarms , no guards . 
well i went to dallas , uh , when i worked for t i in abilene 
and , uh , 
and , uh , it didn't seem like it was that congested in that part . 
you know because to me where we live out here in the north east , there are a lot of buildings very close to each other , 
and the cities are very populated with tenement housing ,
and , uh , they're going to the big cities . 
it makes it very difficult . 
it really does , 
and i've seen the same thing that you're talking about , uh , much more crime than ever before .
and , uh , i don't know , 
a lot of younger people , you know , into more violent crimes . 
oh , yeah , 
that's really sad , you know , 
you got young boys or girls , that at fourteen or twelve years old that are committing murders and , no remorse , what so ever . 
there's a lot of that going on in dallas , too . 
yeah , 
it's really sad . 
it is 
and i don't know if it's , uh , the family , you know , thing where they're not bonding anymore , where mothers are working all the time and ,
and we're falling by the wayside with not incarcerating these people . 
oh , i agree . 
i think that people are getting off too easy . 
they're getting paroled too easily . 
uh , uh . 
they're just getting , uh , put on probation or something , because the prisons don't have enough room 
so they get lighter sentences , 
yeah , exactly . 
and some of those people , they don't deserve to be let loose . 
and , uh , you know , they had , uh , 
in fact on the news last night we were watching this , uh , man who lost his ten year old daughter . 
he ran out to the store for a few minutes 
and he had left her home alone . 
sh , now ten years old , 
she's old enough to be alone for a few minutes , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
and while he was gone , he had went looking for a job and stopped at the store , 
that's what it was . 
and , uh , someone who was in the neighborhood cleaning carpets , these two men , went in , raped the girl , murdered her ,
oh my gosh . 
and one of the men got , uh , i think it was seventeen years 
and the other one was in for , uh , life imprisonment . 
the one that was in for the seventeen years , actually served seven , 
and he's out . 
uh , that's terrible . 
and the man said , that , you know , if it weren't for the fact that he would go to jail , that he would eliminate this person himself .
and i mean , i think that what this is going to lead to is people will take things into their own hands .
actually if they commit a crime that they're in the same circumstances 
the reasons that they're doing it compared to the reason someone else is in jail for it , you know , it's like two different things . 
sometimes when you lose someone that you really love , you do some crazy things 
i don't know , 
it's a little more understandable under the circumstances , i guess . 
i like the idea that , uh , if someone is from a foreign country ,
especially if they're found guilty of the crime . 
you know , once they have been arrested 
and if they know beyond a shadow of a doubt , these people are guilty . 
that's it , 
we don't take care of them , 
we don't support them ,
i mean they go right back where they came from . 
we have enough problems with overcrowding in the jails as it is . 
so let their country take care of it . 
we don't have , i guess too much trouble in dallas with , 
well , i guess we do have a lot of people come in from mexico , that cause problems , 
but , uh . 
but they're , so close , 
i don't consider mexican people in the same category with , uh , 
like you take asian countries , or , uh , the eastern countries where women are like in the foreground , 
and it's like , you know , 
you know , we've advanced beyond that , 
and i think that their , uh , mentality as far as the way they treat them and that kind of thing , 
you know what i mean . 
it was amazing 
i went to the far east , uh , back in october to do some training for t i 
 and i , 
uh , some of those countries were so safe , it was unreal . 
singapore is supposed to be very safe 
and , in fact , tokyo , 
and i thought tokyo would be dangerous being such a huge large city with so many people , 
but they , 
and she thought for a few minutes 
and somebody will turn it in 
and nothing will be missing . 
they said they can just about guarantee that that would happen if you did that . 
you better believe it , 
you wouldn't even have to leave it , 
i mean , 
that's true , 
it would get snatched right off your arm .
that's true . 
oh sure . 
i mean , i couldn't believe that she couldn't think of any place . 
they said , apparently the crime , is , just , uh , 
that's amazing , 
well , what's the difference there , 
do you know ? 
i'm not sure what it is there . 
now , i know what it is in singapore , is they have the death penalty 
and they really enforce it , 
oh , i believe in the death penalty , 
i really do . 
like they enforce the death penalty for that . 
uh , they're just , very , very tough , 
and i guess maybe that's the way tokyo is too , or japan is too . 
they're just very tough on criminals . 
i think that we're too easy . 
uh , and we take the , uh , civil liberties , uh , stuff too far . 
you know like people that are in prison , i mean we didn't put them there . 
they put themselves in that situation . 
oh yeah . 
and as far as like them , uh , entertaining the rights that they should have . 
i mean , we educate them , 
we feed them , 
we take care of them 
and they no sooner get out on the street and they're back in again . 
i'm not saying they're all bad , 
but i think people who are guilty of really serious heinous crimes ,
i think that they should be put away . 
and if they're overcrowded , well , you know  ,
get rid of them . 
i think that that's the whole key here . 
this plea bargaining baloney ,
or , if they're in there and they've got seventeen years and they're on good behavior , for every year they're in they get so many less , you know , that they don't serve the full penalty . 
i really think we're going to far overboard with all of this . 
oh , yeah , 
i agree , because it's not fair to those of us that deserve a safe , you know , life to have to , 
 same  with drunk drivers . 
i think it's too easy for them . 
that if and were , were harsher and were enforced , 
i mean you have to set an example . 
you have to start somewhere . 
and i think that people know that they're going to get a slap on the wrist , they might serve a little bit of time and that they'll be out on the street again . 
 an i feel bad for the policeman ,
and let's face it , 
what do they get paid . 
not much . 
twenty thousand dollars a year , if they're lucky . 
i wouldn't do it for that . 
and especially not in some of these big cities , 
like in dallas i mean they've had , 
they're up in the in the line of duty 
and that's really sad . 
it really is . 
and i mean , they're the first ones that take the brunt of everything . 
you know , and i'm not saying that they're all good either , because there's good and bad in everything , 
but three strikes against them when they're out there . 
because they'll arrest someone and , you know , go through all that paperwork and writing a report and all this , and having all kinds of evidence 
and you have to even be careful how you arrest them , how you talk to them , uh , you know , what they say , 
what , uh , go ahead and tell me about your home .
 well , my home at the moment is an apartment . 
oh , is that right ? .
 but i live in pensacola , florida . 
oh , that's interesting . 
so , i own a home in pensacola , 
and , uh , let's see , 
uh , well , is typical for the area . 
i live in a development , uh , 
it's a relatively , i would say , well , 
god , it .
that's okay .
but it's upper middle class ,
it's a two story colonial , which my wife and i designed . 
oh , that's neat . 
uh , it has around thirtytwo hundred square feet .
wow , that's large .
and of size and so forth , it's relatively typical for the area . 
it might be , 
i would say it's probably midsized for the area . 
there are some smaller , 
and there are , you know , several larger . 
it is , uh , ten years old . 
oh , well , that's not too bad , 
that's still fairly new . 
and so it's , 
in terms of cost and size and so forth , it , uh , 
the uh , compared to other parts of the country , you know , 
let's say compared to maryland  ,
oh , you're kidding .
 well , do you mind if i ask what it's worth down there , 
i mean , what it's , 
i really haven't , uh , 
when we built it ten years ago , it ran around a hundred and forty thousand dollars . 
 so , i haven't really priced , you know , in the market , 
so i , 
it sounds like , 
i mean , from the way you described it a home like that here would be at least two hundred and fifty thousand .
i mean , dallas is a very marked up area , 
although right now it's a lot lower  ,
the economy around here is real poor .
i thought that was on the upswing again now . 
well , no , 
um , there's been tremendous amounts of , uh , layoffs 
so , really housing is real bad . 
the economy itself around here is not too terribly bad , 
but housing is still real bad .
 well , pensacola has 
it's really is a buyer's market there now .
this is , 
and it isn't because of the , well , 
there has been a lot of speculative building .
but , uh , i'm sure people uh , you know , in , uh , galveston and so forth would be knowledgeable about it , uh , 
pensacola is a navy town . 
and home porting was a possibility a few years ago . 
they were expecting an influx of something on the order of fifty thousand people or more from the navy , 
  a new carrier was coming in and , uh , the , uh , attendant , uh , support vessels . 
well , that's no longer ,
so , do you think , 
it was overdeveloped then ? 
i mean , the number of single family units on sale is phenomenal compared to the population . 
and so i , 
overbuilding has been a real problem there . 
so you can still a good house for a very , very reasonable price . 
and i mean good , i would , 
let's say typical , reasonable construction would probably run you , uh , right now somewhere between a hundred and a hundred and forty thousand dollars .
um  , 
what about your home ? 
right now we're just renting , 
but it is a home . um , 
it has about , i guess , eighteen hundred square feet .
it's on one floor .
uh , we have no basement .
i don't know , 
nor do we , 
i wasn't sure . 
most of the ones ,
but , um , anyway , also pretty typical for the area . 
most of this area was developed , 
this house was built in seventyfour . 
 so most of the , 
it's almost twenty years old , 
and most of the houses around here were built pretty much the same style .
uh , we have a friend that lives two blocks over , 
and his house is almost identical to us , except his is three bedrooms and ours is four 
 but otherwise the layout is pretty much the same . 
so i think most of them are 
there was , 
like most areas that are built , um , 
there were probably , like two or three styles you could choose from .
 and , uh , that's pretty much all the houses in the area , maybe even a little bit more than that . 
 well , the housing here in maryland is just atrocious . and in the entire d c area . 
i'm , and montgomery county , 
maryland is probably one of the most expensive ,
where are you in relation to sevren ? 
are you close to sevren ? 
sevren is east , near the eastern shore , 
well , i just , 
if i had , 
i have a sister that used to live in sevren . 
and they bought their home i want to say like around nineteen seventyfive or something like that , 
and they paid like , 
they had it built from , you know , 
they designed it and everything , 
 and to have it built they only paid forty thousand for it , 
and when they left the area they sold it for a hundred and twenty thousand .
oh , that's not unusual , yeah . 
so i just wondered , you know , if the whole area was like that or , 
and so , uh , i was just looking , 
for example there is a , uh , condominium complex next to the apartment complex where i live , 
and i was over there recently looking at the possibility of buying a two bedroom condominium . 
and ninetytwo thousand dollars for a two bedroom , which is essentially a two bedroom apartment . 
now , it was very nicely done . 
 i would have thought   , 
sounds like a lot of money though  , 
so , you know , it's , 
i guess you pay the piper 
oh , yeah . 
uh , for the , 
and so , you , on that  , 
it's not unusual , for example , for somewhere around here on a , 
you know , what you described as your house and what i would describe as my house 
with the homestead exemption and so forth and so on , might pay three or four hundred dollars a year taxes .
but that same house here , you'd pay almost six thousand dollars a year ,
wow , that's , 
so , it's , uh , 
but the taxes would be , you know , perhaps , maybe onethird 
that much of a difference ? 
it's really sad .
this is one of the most highly taxed areas in the country . 
why is that ? 
do you know ? 
i mean  , 
 well , they do have an extremely good , such things as extremely good school systems , for example . 
it has one of the best school systems in the country . 
uh , because the cost of living around here is so high , 
public employees make great salaries around here .
i was reading just recently where the typical administrator in the ,
and i'm not , 
this is , uh , the figure , 
he makes eighty thousand dollars a year . 
and i , 
by administrator i think i mean , 
they did not define it , 
but someone , you know , uh , in that range . 
well , what do you think about it ? 
well , um , most of the stuff up until now , in the recent months , i don't have any problem with . 
i don't either . 
uh , i mean it's , 
you know it , 
i don't think it's going to change very much 
i agree with that . as far as the mess that's developing as a result , um , you know , 
as a country , the united states , uh , 
i think our hands are tied 
in fact , it really was to begin with . 
and , uh , the internal problems , um , somebody may step in again . 
but , uh , i really think it's a u n issue ,
well , you know the funny thing i find about american opinion is that when we have gone in to destabilize a government before , the american public goes crazy . 
and now the fact that we're not interfering with the internal rebellion in iraq , they're going crazy . 
that's right , 
 you know , i mean you can't please them one way or the other . 
absolutely right . 
 you know , i agree with you , 
this is exactly the right course . 
i mean that's an internal problem to iraq . 
it has nothing to do with us . 
and until he starts doing something so inhumane that the u n gets involved , then it's nobody's business . 
that's right . 
i mean these types of internal things go on all over the world all the time . 
i mean , yeah , 
 i mean , 
some of them have been going on for tens of years ,
and it's certainly been going on over there for hundreds of years . 
and it's going to continue . 
that's right . 
as long as you have so many diverse groups that are vying for power , it's going to happen all the time . 
that's absolutely right . 
 i mean the kurds have tried it before . 
they've gotten their butts kicked , 
 and this is just another time that it's happening . 
that's absolutely right . 
you know , they'll regroup out in the mountains 
and they'll try it again in a couple of years . 
you know , it was , 
it's a very opportune moment for them to try . 
you know you , 
we encouraged it .
oh , yeah . 
but , i'm not real sure that we promised them anything . 
that would have been stupid , 
 and i don't think we did it . 
everything else we handled in this seemed to be perfectly right . 
i don't think they would have done that . 
i agree . 
but it really doesn't make any difference . 
this is just another chapter in middle eastern history . 
there are many of them . 
there's no doubt about it . 
 oh , sure , 
i mean the british occupied the place , 
the french occupied it , 
we've done it . 
it's happened so many times , 
this is really nothing special . uh , 
well , or human rights or anything like that . 
that's right , 
 it's mostly religious anyway . 
and , uh , you know , by selfproclamation this is a holy war 
and it is right . 
 and then , uh , we go on from there 
it's a mess . 
there's no doubt about it , 
and , uh , 
 well , i think one of the big problems , 
i mean looking at it from the american public's standpoints , they don't understand the middle easterners . 
that's right . 
they don't understand what , 
i mean their politics really isn't politics . 
it's religion couched as politics . 
 and there's a big difference . 
you know , uh , we sit there 
 and we think that they think the way we think . 
and that's a big mistake ,
you bet . 
you bet . 
well , yeah , 
because there's a complete different set of values . 
 um , there's different value placed on human life ,
 and , uh , what's right is wrong and what's wrong is right in some cases . 
that's it a lot of the time . 
for a year and a half . 
and it was tough ,
you know , 
it was very strange . 
i believe it . 
it was very interesting . 
i can believe that . 
i don't claim to have an indepth understanding by any means , 
but , uh , 
 now i , 
shoot , don't have a clue sometimes . 
that's probably true , 
 you know and read their books and then proclaim themselves an expert . 
 well , i'm not real sure that's appropriate . 
that's , uh , 
a little bit of background study has never made an expert in any field . 
but , uh , 
well , i sort , 
that sort of goes to my pet peeve about the education system in this country , too . 
and we make experts by reading books . 
that's right . 
you know , and the japanese and the germans and everybody else make experts by doing . 
i guess you work for t i . 
that's right , yes . 
so you guys are well aware of the problems with the japanese markets and everything else . 
that's an everyday occurrence . 
it's like our car industry , 
the only reason our car industry hasn't gone down the tubes is because the japanese , you know , came into it and helped ,
i agree . 
in this country understanding , uh , foreign cultures ,
and , uh , it bites us over and over 
and we're going to be , 
we've already been overtaken , 
but it's going to get even worse later . 
 i mean looks who's getting the engineering degrees and the , the math and the science and everything . 
that's right . 
it's not us . 
that's right . 
you know , who get degrees in basket weaving and 
 and where are the engineers coming from ? 
uh , well , they're coming from various places , 
and a lot of them are going back there . 
that's  , 
uh , my roommate is a , uh , 
he's getting his doctorate in industrial , 
well , it's not industrial engineering , 
it's human factors . 
his degree was in , uh , industrial engineering . 
i see . 
uh , and he's from the philippines . 
and the only reason he came here was because the education is so much better for those who will go after it . 
he has no intention of going back to the philippines because there's no jobs . 
you know , uh , but i see it all too often . 
i mean we've got loads of foreign students 
 and they're coming here , going after the hard degrees 
and then they're going back to korea and japan ,
and they're applying it there . 
that's right . 
and i don't know , 
to me it's amazing . 
i don't know what we're going to do as a country . 
we're going to become dependent on these other folks sooner or later . 
uh , with quarterly reports and annual statements and things like that . 
 and the are just kind of , become a thing of the past . 
and , uh , 
i don't think there can be anymore long range planning . 
i think it's sticking your finger in the holes in the dike . 
you know , oh , here's a crisis . 
well , let's plug it up . 
i don't know . 
i don't know what the answer is . 
it's far beyond me . 
that's for sure . 
that's the way things have gotten . 
all we can do is keep plugging . 
you know , i wonder , 
i read in the paper just last week , i b m's unveiling their new laptop computer . 
well , at a price tag of six thousand bucks , i don't know if they're going to have a whole lot of takers . 
now i have the i b m , p s two 
 but i'm sorry i got it . 
it's slow , 
uh , there are many better machines on the market right now 
the only reason i got it is because i got it through an educational purchase plan 
 and i saved fortyeight percent , 
but up to that point i had always said i would never have one because i wouldn't pay that kind of money for their name . 
that's right . 
that's absolutely right , 
now you watch , 
just sure as anything , the japanese are going to come out with a laptop at half the price 
unfortunately get something in your hands , 
it's already outdated . 
it's obsolete , 
and , uh 
 i can imagine . 
 and , uh , 
 uh , years ago , i remember when i had a t i ninetynine .
and , uh , things just kept changing so much 
and i kept getting rid of them , 
that's right . 
you've got to buy something and stick with it , 
that's right . 
at an opportune time i got one that suited my needs 
and i've just stuck with it . 
the only thing i've done to it is just uh , add a mouse and a hard drive . 
and that's all i plan to do . 
of course , i'm limited on memory now because i've got the low line . 
i got the model twentyfive . 
oh , okay . 
so i'm stuck with six forty , 
but i'm not a power user 
so it doesn't matter . 
well , whatever works for you . 
and , uh , if it does the job , then that's what you need . 
now my roomie , on the other hand , he is a power user . 
he's looking now to get rid of his . 
he's got a three eightysix and wants to get a four eightysix .
well , on this subject of invasion of privacy , yes , it's very easy for anybody to find out about you . 
well , i don't really like that very much . 
yeah , uh , 
the special on channel thirteen that was broadcast , i think , last week or so ago , it detailed how this one person went about finding out from this particular person his home mortgage , how much he pays for it , what his payments are , uh , his , uh , social security number , driver's license , any kind of records he may have . uh , their credit card and the status of their credit . 
what was the reason why somebody was trying to find out all that stuff ? 
it was just as a demonstration to show 
and it was , 
mostly it dealt with , uh , marketing companies , these , uh , direct marketing ,
 oh , yeah . 
that was the primary subject . 
that's how they obtain information about segments of society and group them into age brackets , uh , their habits , their hobbies , their income . 
and they're able to do that through all the manipulations of the computer . 
well , that's not really good . 
i don't know , 
i guess that's an invasion of privacy . 
i'm not sure that that's an everyday thing , though , at least not for , you know , an individual . 
something that i feel the open office concept . 
and people have little cubicles . 
well , that's all fine and good , 
but you don't really have any privacy at all . 
not insofar as maybe making conversation with somebody , i suppose , because overheard 
 and they get , 
i suppose any items that you have laying out can be easily seen . 
yeah , 
there is , 
it's not just that , 
it's , uh , the whole thing about , you know , if you're trying to concentrate , well , it's rather hard , 
sometimes it's almost impossible to do 
and i work in a situation like that 
and i really kind of have a problem with that . 
do you work with , uh , mixed company , male and female 
oh , yeah . 
is there anybody who doesn't ? 
i suppose it depends on who you're working for and where at . 
but , um , my own environment is open totally . 
there are no cubicles . 
there's nothing to block anything . 
so , yeah , 
but , um , i guess we're changing ever so rapidly in the devices of communications that anything can be obtained from anybody's record , 
 or the computers , they can all hold such large data bases on anybody that all you have to do is touch a button 
and it appears 
and you don't have to , 
i know the government sells information to private companies about individuals or families . 
that's no secret , 
and it shouldn't be that way i don't think . 
that's quite right either . 
i mean it's not really government for the people and by the people , 
i'll tell you that . 
hum , what do you think could be done about it ? 
uh , the only way it can change is , um , if everybody bands together . 
it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office . 
but , uh , i don't see anything like that to occur unless everybody bands together to do that . 
it has to be one common ideal goal for that to be done . 
um , i don't know , 
we're able to obtain information . 
and i wouldn't be for total banning of , uh , all information 
or , it's mostly the private information that we're all concerned about . 
but it's hard to define 
it really is . 
a dealing with is like a credit bureau . 
well , they take my name , which is a very common name , 
and my last name is even more common 
 and they check that name against , uh , their list 
and they find several . 
and without even bothering to try to match up any other information at all , they just report everything under that name . 
so you've received a lot of , uh , flack ? 
they don't even check my social security number . 
and companies are paying them good money to report accurately , 
and they're not , 
they're so lazy . 
they're just not doing it . 
i mean they just find your name 
and they match it up . 
you know , and that just drives me crazy because they're , 
and then they want , 
then , you know , to get it removed they say , well , you know , you have to write this long detailed letter and everything like that to them , you know , 
and then it takes three weeks  and all  .
you messed it up , 
you fix it . 
is that usually what you tell them in the letter ? 
 like , uh , uh , recently i was reported as having j c penney accounts 
and i don't . 
so i called j c penney 
and you're not doing your job . 
good idea . 
so that's what i've taken to doing lately , 
and it seems to work pretty well so far . 
well , that's good . 
uh , any other problems ? 
i guess i've just about run out of , 
i can probably go on , 
but it's , uh , 
i'm clouding up right now . 
oh , yeah , 
i probably better let you get back to work . 
well , it's nice talking to you . 
maybe again . 
all rightie . 
i don't know what and that kind of stuff . 
i haven't gotten really involved in anything , uh , extensive in car repairs in , oh , oh , probably a year or so . 
i think the last thing i did of any significance was change the water pump on an oldsmobile . 
i had a similar thing , that i've worked on cars ever since i was , uh , a kid .
and that was some time ago , 
but i've gotten to the point where , uh , the newer cars are getting so complicated to work on that , uh , oh , most of the cars 
i try to buy as simple a car as possible . 
i know what you mean . 
so , you know , changing the oil , changing the spark plugs 
and most of them now , you know , you don't go through the ignition stuff anymore because that's all solid state or , 
or fuel injected , 
and so there's , 
so there goes the carburetor 
and if the fuel injection system breaks down ,
there's no way . 
somebody once said , uh , i had a car that said fuel injection on the side of it 
and a woman asked me what that meant 
 oh , yeah , 
basically that's it . 
 you know , they've gotten so complicated or so high tech that , uh , in the garage and do a whole lot of repairs , uh . 
i've got , uh , an eightyfour chevy van that's , uh , a one ton van with a camper conversion on it . 
it's got the good old three fifty ,
regular gas engine , 
and that engine i understand , 
i can actually work on that engine . 
i used to have , uh , chevy van , 
it was a short van ,
 and basically it was a motor 
and you didn't have all the other junk around it , 
 and you could get to it to work on it . 
i had to change the water pump in that , here about a year ago . 
and it was really fairly easy . 
take the grill out and the radiator out 
and you can just stand there and work on it . 
the hardest part about , uh , water pump changes is getting all the junk off , before you can get too it . 
well that's true .
you're right , you know , 
by the time you've finally got down to it , 
i was hoping i could remember where all those other things went . 
well that's kind of the way i was , 
i tried to remember as i took stuff off where it went , 
and i don't think i had too many nuts and bolts left over when i got it all put back together . 
a few years ago i had an oldsmobile diesel 
and , uh , the , 
uh , it , 
after about a hundred thousand miles the injector pump went out on it . 
and , uh , i bought it when we were living in lubbock , 
when i came back here , i brought the car back here 
and , uh , i don't know , diesels got pretty unpopular 
and you couldn't sell the thi , 
i mean , though for what you could get for one ,
and , uh , the injector pump went bad 
so i found a outfit down here to rebuild it .
and that was probably one of the most miserable things i had gotten into in a long time . 
i don't think i'd know where to start with a diesel . 
oh , well , you know , i , 
diesels don't require mechanics , 
they require plumbers . 
well that's true . 
and , uh , .
i think the to a diesel is , i've worked for a tractor repair shop , uh , when i was in high school 
and , uh , we used to overhaul farm tractors basically , 
 and they were nearly all diesel , 
but as far as cars i've never , never been involved with them . 
well the injector nozzle and stuff in , you know , the big diesel farm tractors , you know , what are about the size of your thumb , 
and the , 
well , yeah , 
and you can get to them . 
and the ones in the diesel cars were little tiny things and just almost impossible to do anything with . 
well i , 
i've had a lot of good service out of that car , 
but , uh , uh , i finally gave it to my son 
and he drove it literally into the ground , you know .
he was out at tech 
and he finished it off . 
i guess you're right 
the diesel has almost fallen into unpopular status . 
i don't know exactly why . 
one of the reasons is 
where do you get gas at . 
i su , 
i don't know if it's still , uh , limited like it was , 
i don't notice it , probably because i don , 
the availability ? 
you mean the diesel availability ? 
but maybe because i'm not looking for it . 
well i'd bought , uh , a g m c diesel pickup and , uh , loved that thing , you know , 
i really liked it . 
but it turns out a pickup wasn't what i really needed , 
 and it was the van that i needed then , to buy the , you know , 
traded it in on the chevy van . 
but , uh , sure enjoyed it . 
but the three fifty in the van ? 
that's what i like because , they've got plenty of power , 
and , uh , 
i'm convinced that , uh , detroit or whoever it is made a major mistake ,
i'm convinced that the small v eight like the mustang's original two eightynine or some of the chevy two eightythrees ,
but they had enough power t , pull all this weight . 
 and the four cylinders just don't have it . 
i think in fiftyfive , i think was two sixtyfive , something like that . 
little , you know , not whole lot more than the six cylinder that i think was like about two thirtyfive or so . 
but , uh , they kept boring that block out to where you could a get a just kept boring it out and boring it out and stroking it a little bit more , an . 
i think those little v eights could have been made to be pretty powerful little engines , if they would have gone with it , 
well uh , that was a short stroke engine it could really wind up . 
oh , yeah . 
the two little cars i've got now , 
bought a mitsubishi mirage here a couple of years ago 
 and it was normally carbureted 
and it's fairly easy to work with because there's not just a whole lot in it to go wrong ,
that's kind of like , 
well my first car was a fiftysix mustang 
and , uh , over the years , uh , all 
i had a , uh , dodge pickup several years ago , 
and , uh , i can't remember the size of the engine 
it was a three oh , seven or something like that , 
 but , uh , i remember working on those cars , 
you'd open the hood 
and there was basically nothing in there but an engine ,
now , you open the hood and it's scary . 
like you say it takes a plumber to figure out where all this stuff goes . 
the friend of ours over here , he's got , uh , sixtyfive , or sixtysix mustang the six cylinder . 
 and , uh , i was look under the hood of that the other day 
and like you say , you can see the road . 
it's amazing . 
well if you had to you could climb up in there and do what you needed to . 
yeah , you could stand in there if you really wanted to , i guess . 
my dad's got a new , um , 
i guess it's an eightynine or ninety , uh , chrysler something or other . 
it's one of those transverse mounted v sixes , front wheel drive . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , he was showing it to me 
and we're looking under the hood and everything's nice and clean 
and , you know , you can see the three spark plugs there in the front . 
and he'd never really thought about it . 
it's going to be a problem getting back there because it was shoved right up against the fire wall . 
so they just about complicated the things so much that shade tree mechanics can't do much with them . 
well when they went to the , 
started with the newer engines , you know , 
when they started putting all that pollution control stuff on the older engines is where they started getting into so much , you know , trouble . because the three fifty with all the , you know , 
like well , actually , i guess , her , 
within a couple of years ago anyway was the last i've paid any attention to it . 
the three oh five was that , 
and it had all the air pump and , uh , uh , 
the antismog pumps . 
and all the antismog stuff . 
and , uh , boy that was , uh , really a mess back under there in that van . 
and all that stuff loads the motor down . 
so it's trying to push the weight plus have all this drain on it from all sorts of belts and things . 
but that's one good thing 
i've got a , uh , eight ninety , uh , chevy blazer now 
and it's got one , uh , belt on it a serpentine belt . 
oh , it's that one that's about , uh , what an inch and a half wide . 
got a bunch of groves in it . 
i haven't had to replace the thing yet . 
it looks like it would be , uh , better than having , 
i've got an , an olds toronado that , i think's got six belts on the sucker . 
 and i had to get all those off , you know , when i was replace that , uh , water pump . 
 and , uh , i had to struggle with that for a while to figure which belt goes where . 
it's kind of like the inside dual on a truck . 
you know , when one of them breaks ,
 oh man . 
it's usually that power steering be , 
or something that's way back in there . 
you bet , 
everything else's got to come off first . 
well , it's a pleasure meeting you . 
and we'll , uh , 
how many times have you done this now ? 
is this , 
uh , i've got , uh , five stickers here from t i , 
so i guess i've done probably , uh , i'd say seven or eight of them . 
i gotten any calls here in the last , uh , 
this is the first one in a week or so . 
i haven't gotten any calls in two weeks , 
so i don't know , if it's tapering off , or what . 
if it's winding down or what . 
i had a difficult time the past couple of times of getting , uh , answers . 
finding a taker . 
so it sounds , 
it's taken them fifteen minutes at a time , 
so , people are either not , 
maybe they're burnt out or , 
 anyway let you go . 
thanks for talking . 
all right . 
so do you do a lot of cooking in your family ? 
i work 
and my wife's home during the day 
so she usually ends up doing most of it . 
oh , yeah . 
when i was single we used to always cook , around the house . 
do you like to cook . 
huh , yeah , 
 um , there's a few dishes , 
like , um , you know , having polish and ukrainian food . 
oh , really . 
and my wife , she likes italian and stuff , 
 so we definitely have different tastes , 
but that's neat though , because you get to have different stuff .
i'm a pretty bad cook .
i'm pretty bad . 
my husband is really good , 
he put himself through college working in restaurants . 
oh , wow . 
and , uh , he's much better cook than i am , 
so , when i was home i still cooked a lot 
and i was in to a lot of vegetarian stuff . 
and now , i went back to work about a year and a half ago 
so , one of the things that he took over was the cooking 
and the kids are thrilled , 
they're really happy , that i don't cook anymore . 
let him do it 
but , um , do you have kids ? 
you obviously have one . 
you have two . 
one is , uh , nine months 
and the other is two and a half . 
two and half , oh . 
that's the hard part is cooking with , uh , kids around uh , becau , 
or are you not at that stage yet ? 
we try our hardest to get them to eat what we , eat , you know . 
and my sister , uh , she's the master of the fast order grill , you know , 
 oh , yeah . 
 uh , she makes six different meals , 
 oh my gosh . 
like to have one thing , you know , 
one likes chicken nuggets , the other one like hot dogs , 
 oh my gosh , 
i couldn't .
 and then she makes noodles uh , with , 
so , all things . 
 boy , i couldn't do that , 
i  , 
but , um , yeah , 
our favorite , 
let me think , 
i was thinking of the one recipe uh , that we made . 
i guess the thing that always turned out the best for us was something we thought looked really fancy but was real easy , 
and that was , um , 
what's that . 
 oh really . 
it has a french name , 
it basically means that it has a swiss cheese , cream sauce with it 
and you pour it over rice , 
oh yeah , 
what is that , saint jack or something . 
yeah , uh . 
scallops saint something , 
or , yeah ,   .
i can't even remember what the recipe's name is anymore , 
 but , uh , it was basically just ground up swiss cheese and then , uh , standard cream sauce base and then , uh 
with scallops . 
 and it sounds sort of funny 
but it tastes really good . 
i'm from new england , 
so we had , um , a lot of seafood before we moved down here . 
and , uh , that sounds delicious to me . 
that sounds great . 
but , uh , 
we're just thinking of having , a , uh , dinner party . 
we went to this dinner party the other night that was kind of like a game , 
they had , uh , a murder mystery , 
 and you came dressed as one of the characters 
and you had to solve the mystery during the dinner , 
 and it was really fun 
and so you know , we were going to try doing it ourselves , 
but we're trying to decide what can we serve because at this one the hostess was pretty busy running around trying to get stuff ready for the table 
and that kind of interrupted the game , 
and then you can make that ahead 
and you can just leave it in the pot on a stove until you're ready . 
so that's , uh , 
that's another thing 
i have a problem with my wife , 
um , she doesn't like the beef dishes . 
she likes the chicken and fish , 
 uh , yeah . 
 and , like i said , we always ate beef and , uh , pork ,
 oh , yeah . 
i know , 
my husband did too .
his parents are austrian 
and they , uh , always made sure they had a lot of meat at the table .
oh yeah , 
red meat , plenty of good red meat . 
my dad could eat , a meal with out any vegetables at all . 
oh , my gosh . 
and , uh , susan's , you know , they had , you know meatless meals , you know . 
my dad wouldn't know what to do . 
 oh , gosh , 
so do you , 
course , she grew up catholic 
so you know , they , 
 oh , they did the , 
there's a certain amount of meatless meals you have to have .
that you do , 
that's just part of it . 
my family didn't , 
but when i got into the vegetarian cooking we got kind of used to that , 
but my husband always did it kind of grudgingly , 
he never , 
there was dishes that he really enjoyed , eating . 
there were several things that he liked 
but it never was really , something that he would have chosen . 
it's just that i cooked 
so he had to put up with it .
 but there was one thing that he couldn't stand 
and that was soybeans . 
i tried it like once or twice 
and he just could not eat it , 
so i never , 
i had , 
i was limited . 
i had to make vegetarian meals without using soy beans , 
it's hard to get a protein content up then .
that's true .
i like them every now and then for a change , 
it's nice . 
some of the stuff is good , 
but it was a tremendous amount of cooking .
because you do have to make sure you have the right combinations of different proteins to make sure they're complete , 
 and we had little kids at the time , you know , 
when i was home with them , and it was just so much cooking , 
i don't like to cook . 
 and i'm not really that great at it 
so it just turned out to be too much cooking . 
so , well , i guess i'll let you get back to feeding your little one there . 
no , uh , 
he's all done . 
he's set , 
oh okay . 
do you like to bake at all , 
or that , 
my mom , used to go crazy , every sunday , until my dad like blew up , you know .
after he gained about eighty pounds after coming back from the navy , she stopped doing it . 
but , um , she used to have , you know , two dozen sticky buns , three bread rolls , you know , every week . 
no kidding . 
 and , um , the sticky buns , of course , would last , you know three or four days 
and that would be it . 
then be gone . 
i know , 
that's the thing about baking . 
i don't mind baking at all 
and i can do a pretty good pie , 
we have this pie crust recipe in our family that my grandmother gave my mother 
and my mother taught me how to make it . 
 i can make a pretty mean pie , 
but , um , i don't do it anymore because it's just too fattening . 
we had the same kind of problem . 
if you make homemade bread , 
 i mean , it's supposed to save you money 
but you eat like three times the amount of bread that you usually eat .
it tastes so good . 
we had that bread that was , uh , um , 
you ever seen the starter bread , 
i can't remember what it's called , 
they call it the , um , amish bread here 
 oh , uh , yeah . 
 uh , it's made with , 
you just leave it out , 
 you know , and you let it spoil sort of . 
but i've never done it . 
you know , yeah . 
that sounds pretty good . 
it tasted pretty good , really . 
but , uh , it's the sort of thing where you let a portion of it go bad 
and then you add all these other ingredients to it , 
and then you make the bread 
but you pinch off a portion , or save a portion of it for the next time , or something . 
you take some of the batter out and give it to someone else 
and that's how they continue the thing . 
i know , it always sounded , 
i don't know how safe that was .
i know it sounded strange to me too , 
so , you know , yeah . 
that's true , 
that's got to kill anything i guess , 
well , i'll talk to you later . 
all right , 
well , yeah 
where are you calling from by the way , texas . 
plano , in texas . 
are you in texas ? 
falls church , virginia . 
no kidding , 
gosh it sounds so close . 
i know we've got a good connection , 
must be a , uh , t i connection , 
i thought for sure you were in dallas or something . 
i talked to so many people from texas 
that's where practically everybody i talked to is from . 
i think that's why they call me because they want to get people outside the state , you know . 
they're trying to get all different amount of people . 
well gee , my husband is from richmond 
and i went to u v a , 
that's where we went . 
oh , oh really . 
uh , well i went to school at west virginia university , 
 oh you did , 
 but i grew up right here in falls church , right outside d c . 
boy we'd like to get back over to the east coast , 
i'll tell you . 
it's nice over there . 
it's sort of funny , 
i have people that want to go to dallas . 
oh , really . 
one of my friends here , he was just talking how he's thinking of leaving the company and going to dallas , 
saying how , 
oh , yeah , 
no kidding . 
well , things are doing pretty good down here , 
we tried to move over to raleigh last year 
and such little going on in raleigh , you know , 
you couldn't get a job to save yourself over there 
so we decided we'll try in a couple of years , 
but business is , 
we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash , you know . 
you probably could , 
well northern virginia . 
well it's good talking to you . 
nice talking to you too . 
take care . 
bye , bye , 
well , i mean , i don't know what you think about the , subject , 
uh , to go to the judge instead of the jury and allowing him to do that . 
i've been kind of sitting here thinking about that a little bit while i was waiting for them to phone somebody , 
and i don't know that that's not a good idea . 
that's not a bad idea 
um , uh , that , you know , 
they probably , need to change it somehow , uh , 
the whole system needs changing , 
we've just got too many people  in there   ,
i agree . 
and it's another form of sentencing . 
but on that one thing , i still think it should be a unanimous decision , 
 oh , yeah , 
i agree . 
 uh , i think we're getting to the point now where they're going to eventually let it be , um , majority vote . 
and that's not going to be good . 
i don't like that , 
no . 
i don't like that at all . 
i know my husband served on a jury a few months ago up here in denton , 
but , uh , it was a drug conviction 
and i don't remember 
he had some cocaine and was accused of selling it , 
and i don't remember exactly how much he had 
but , uh , actually not selling  it   , 
there's a difference , 
 couriering  it is what , 
ther , is supposedly a difference from selling then being a courier 
and , uh , he sat on that jury 
and they found him guilty , 
and they went through the sentencing phase and everything 
and , uh , you know , they were told that , you know , during the trial that this is this guy's first offense 
and he's got this clean record , 
and they ended up , 
and it was time to do this drug thing 
and let's crackdown 
and let's really , 
and they sentenced him to fifteen years ,
and they sentencing him to fifteen years 
and , um , after it was all over , uh , sit down with the judge and with the other two lawyers 
and they were told that , uh , he would probably serve three ,
however , they could not tell the jury that during the trial because all three of them were in appeal . 
oh , yeah . 
so , the jury didn't know about it , 
so here they based their sentencing thinking that this was this guy's first offense , 
 sure  .
but it's just , you know , horrible ,
  yeah  .
and he'd been convicted three times before , you know , 
  oh  .
 and the jury was very upset 
and my husband came home , very upset , 
i mean , he felt that they had been tricked , you know , 
 so something , 
i wonder if a judge didn't have control of that if some of that would change , you know . 
the judge might know 
or at least it wouldn't hurt to switch over there and see if it worked any better , 
if it didn't we can come back for something else 
that's true . 
 or what we've got , 
well , we definitely need a change in the system 
and , uh , 
obviously what we are doing is not working , you know . 
it's just piling up on us . 
and you know , there's people in  our  prisons that are not being rehabilitated in any way , shape , or form , 
 and either they're in there ,
and they're going to be right back for the same thing 
so the system , 
we're just a society not willing to spend the time or the money to do what it takes , 
that's very true . 
yeah , 
i was talking to a friend of mine about this the other day 
but i really believe that we need to take care of ourselves , 
 i mean , we , 
 and the , 
 and maybe so , 
and , we will continue funding you for the next two years , 
after two years we'll cut it down you know , seventyfive percent . 
and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent , 
and in five years , it sh , 
by then you all should have a plan worked where you can make it on your own without our help . 
and then we will have the money if we would do that to , 
and we're trying to ,
it's just not , 
  oh , yeah   , 
 your right   ,   .
 the  aid  presented to the kurds 
and i feel sorry for them 
and i know they're suffering 
and i know they're dying everyday , 
but we've got , you know , kids here in the united states that are dying everyday , too .
  oh  .
and , you know , i don't know . 
i just have this problem with ,
  you bet  .
well , we seem to agree on the jury thing 
 uh , but ,  uh   , we'll need an unanimous verdict 
i think we should try it , like you say , 
if it doesn't work , we can always come back , 
but i think it would be a good idea to try it . 
i do too . 
so , anyway , well , we all agree . 
 well , good . 
good to hear from you . 
you too , byebye . 
i could never justify owning a personal computer at home , uh , 
i mean , that's quite an expense to look for , uh , 
well , who is this , 
what do you use yours at home for ? 
my wife works out of our home . 
she has an office 
and in fact she sits in the office 
and she uses it to compose and print out letters . 
well now . 
so that's a very regular use of it that she has . 
and in addition to that i tinker around with it . 
i'm a computer scientist . 
so i write programs to do little things 
i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special . 
and also i'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like . 
uh , huh , well , excuse me , electronics tech . 
years ago t i sent me to their , uh , computer school down in austin . 
so , uh , i learned to repair one 
but you know i never really learned to operate one . 
oh , that's a key thing . 
well , actually that's a , 
there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today .
so that yo , 
in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming 
but if they were careful , they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works . 
but i think you you really hit the nail on the head . 
for the average person is exactly what he can use it for . 
and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters 
or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the nuts and bolts in your garage , 
your issue is then there really , 
well , uh , space is a handicap with me , 
i live in a motor home . 
oh , i see 
and i'm preparing for retirement . 
i see 
well , congratulations on that . 
and i'm not to far from it another year and a half . 
well , actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap . 
but just like the computers . 
uh , remember how they started out running three , four hundred dollars . 
oh , the calculators you mean . 
i beg your pardon . 
they sure do . 
i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum . 
you can actually buy a whole brand new computer not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars . 
you're kidding . 
including a printer ? 
but you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars 
so make it seven hundred . 
a hundred ? 
wholly smoke , 
a respectable one ? 
well , see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them , 
but that does amaze me . 
the prices had plummeted , 
you can buy just the guts with the power supply ,
and then the keyboard is another fifty , 
the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred 
and then the disk drive is two fifty . 
well , a good brand a inexpensive . 
you're buying these knock offs , 
so there's , 
probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called computer shopper . 
it's a big magazine , 
it's twelve inches the narrow side and 
oh , wow . 
and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages . 
but computer mailorder houses 
and they're all competing with each . 
so you just flip through there until you find a 
it's the original p c . 
so it's , 
we call i'm sorry an i b m p c compatible . 
and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twentyfive dollars which is amazing to me . 
and you mix and match 
and then you do it by mailorder . 
but there's no real brands 
it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards , the main computer , the circuit board . 
i see . 
how do you go about getting one of those a catalogs ? 
they're available in , you know , the b daltons , that type of thing . 
you'll notice although it's a magazine it's large . 
and like i said it's about an inch thick .
well , getting back to the p c s , 
i'll tell you , 
i ya , 
first of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me . 
and secondly , i did learn this much about computers , 
they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten . 
in binary . 
that's right .
there's great . 
well , anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes . 
oh , yeah .
one and one equals ten . 
that's great . 
course it's kind of an inside joke , you know . 
you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary . 
 i understand , 
that's great , 
that's a good joke . 
so what , 
do you , uh , uh , work with a computers at t i ? 
and then i was a scientist over in central research labs 
and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing . 
uh , now i type that one , 
but i don't use it anymore . 
well i just recently started using one .
uh , i keep track of an inventory here . 
and of course now that is where a computer is very handy . 
i agree . 
and , well it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated . 
oh , yeah . 
see i'm with the q r a lab .
oh , i see 
that's fascinating . 
so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated , 
 and they're dated . 
so i have to keep up with them , uh , 
and it's very handy doing it on the computer . 
i just run a printout every week 
what i have to do , what i have to ship , what i should be expecting to be returned . 
so a , 
it is handy . 
and i must admit that up until i did start using one , uh , i had very little interest in computers . 
but they are amazing . 
they certainly are . 
so let's see 
i think we did . 
nice little conversation with you jack . 
mike you take care now . 
good day . 
good luck to you . 
thank you . 
same to you . 
but can't decide , 
mostly it's been because i didn't like the color , 
 or , um , i'm not sure whether i've had to return that many things , uh , 
well , i'm having a problem right now with a computer that we've just returned . 
oh , are you ? 
so , for me it's actually a pretty good topic . 
so , we'll talk about that some . 
i'm going to let you kind of lead the pack ,
let me tell you just a little bit about myself . 
for years i did all that shopping and whatnot , 
but for the last four or five years i've had eye problem , 
 and i've had two cornea transplants . 
shopping is no fun anymore .
i can imagine . 
well , see i don't , 
i can't see good enough , you know , 
and , uh , it's hard to tell what i'm doing , 
and it's just aggrav , 
you can't read labels 
and you can't , 
oh , i just thought of something we have to return .
there you go . 
all right . 
it'll come to us , 
laurie , all right .
all right , uh , 
tell me about your computer , laurie , 
i think that sounds fascinating . 
well , we bought a computer because my husband needed to use it to do some work for a consulting project , 
and we called up the company and asked them details on it . 
we bought not a name brand because the clones are so much cheaper . 
and we called up the company that somebody else we knew had dealt with , 
and they were very happy with the system , 
and they felt they've gotten a good price . 
and we went in , 
we explained what we needed 
and  yes  
we had to go across the george washington bridge to new jersey to meet these people . 
and so we went there , 
we told them about the stuff 
and the guy said , uh , that the computer would fit our needs . 
and we  , 
these things won't make any sense to you probably 
but he told us 
oh , yes . 
and it's called a user boards 
or slots is what it's called . 
and he told us there's four sixteen bit slots and two eight bit slots available for the user , 
and we can put full size cards in there . 
we'll buy it , 
and we put in our order . 
and a week later we went back and picked up the computer . 
and then we got it home and tried to put our own board in it 
and there's only one slot we could put it in . 
oh , lovely . 
and at this point we only have one board 
so it wasn't so bad 
so we used it a bit , 
but we tried to figure out whether we could put three in because we really need to be able to put at least three in . 
 oh , no   , 
the computer was supposed to have two . 
but the problem is that you can't put the type of card that we need to put in it , in it .
oh , i see . 
they told us there would be no problem because , you know , 
i see . 
in some ways it has more to do with the people who sold it . 
they probably didn't know what they were talking about . 
that's completely it . 
the salesman didn't know . 
so , we went back in , 
and we struck an agreement with the people 
 who said  change the casing it comes in so that we could put in extra boards . 
so they did that . 
we don't want you to go through the work and then find out that this doesn't really work anyway , and et cetera , 
and they were doing it at their own costs . 
and we went back 
and we talked to the   person a second time and things like that , 
and then we get the computer home , 
my husband goes to pick it up last week 
and we couldn't go get it sooner because i just had the baby , 
and  ,
 uhhuh  .
and , uh , he goes and gets it , brings it home , 
first of all they're missing components of it like cables so you can't really test it out . 
and then second thing , we still can't put the boards in ,
 oh ,  jeez  .
and see now we're dealing with having to bring it back again 
and they say they can , you know , do something different and change some connectors 
and we hope so , 
but it's a hassle . 
it really is . 
you know , it's just this problem with sales people just not knowing what goes on . 
and so much time goes past before you finally get any kind of satisfaction . 
i think that's the worst part . 
so , well , actually some things are pretty good with that because i put it on a gold credit card 
and i just called the credit card company and explained to them the situation , 
it really is . 
i think , uh , uh , there's a lot not to be said for credit 
but that's one thing to be said for credit . 
 how   ,
and so , you know , 
and i think that's really important . 
if you can't fix this to our satisfaction ,
that's right . 
and if we do that , 
i just tell the credit card company , don't pay the charge ,
that's right . 
 no  .
but they'll just , you know , 
they will , 
that's right . 
they will , 
they will put the kind of clout on them that you can't really do . 
 hal  bought me , uh , uh , small , uh , well , uh , uh ,  , little jam box kind of thing 
so i'd , 
i have my ninetythree year old mother living with us , 
and so she doesn't remember anything 
but to keep her entertained , music and some of these things do help . 
and i thought well , if i had , uh , i figured well this will be good . 
well , uh , uh , the first time i turned it on , uh , i was recording , 
and the next thing i knew the tape was chewed up in the ,
 oh , no . 
so after that then  , you couldn't get a tape to play at the right speed in that side . 
and then on the other side , uh , to , uh , videotaping they were doing , 
and she says it's wrong too because the little thing pokes out too far , 
and so the right way ,
so , uh , 
what brand is it ? 
do you know ? 
so i wish i could tell you 
 it's   , 
but i was wondering like , you know 
in our case where we knew we were buying a copy 
we weren't buying ,
and i was wondering if you , 
and i suspect that it's probably  , just a fluke , you know . 
i have the papers and everything 
and we're going to just take it back 
but , uh , 
do you buy it at some major store ? 
highlands  , 
  chain down there that i don't know up here . 
do they have highlands up there ? 
don't they ? 
well , this was a regular , uh , electronics store , you know . 
so , i don't think there will be too much problem 
but i guess i'm not sure whether i think things are not made as well . 
i think they deliberately sometimes , um , 
i think a lot of things are not made as well . 
don't you ? 
what are you , 
um , oh , wel , 
of course , it's hard to think of an exact example , 
 but um , 
that's  good  
they're getting a kind of a , attitude of ,
well , i like electronic stuff ,
for one thing . i know their , work , you know , 
cars i think are not made ,
i think that's right . 
the fact that , 
because  i   , 
they want people to replace it after ,
the fact that they have competition with the japanese and whatnot sometimes , uh , dwells on a fact that , you know , uh , 
i've known people who have had toyotas for years that have had almost no repair work to do on them . 
well , they may cost a little more , 
but they don't have to take them to the shop every other day . 
i had a toyota 
and i loved it . 
my toyota did ,
it does the , 
so , part of it is that we need to develop more in , uh , the kinds of things we do so we make them better . 
and it kind of has to start from the top or from the bottom maybe and go clear up . 
well , i think part of the problem comes in sort of shoddy workmanship . 
the people just don't care about ,
you know , the whole , 
nobody cares , nobody's , 
give me my paycheck , so i can go home . 
i think that's too bad . 
and it's a shame too because , uh , when you get right down to it most things , if you do a good job , nobody can pay you enough .
 there  isn't ,
but if you do a good job , you feel enough satisfaction , 
so whatever you're paid is enough . 
and also i think , 
well , i do research 
and so i'm used to sort of being underpaid for whatever work gets done . 
and you get satisfaction out of it . 
that's right , 
i think they underestimate how much value the satisfaction 
because the companies that , give the attitude that , well , you know , 
you're the last one hired 
so you'll be the first one fired , 
 and we just want you to do your day's work , 
 and we don't really care about you ,
when you've got that type of attitude on it , the people don't care ,
  no  .
and so , 
home though unfortunately . 
starts with the one person that , you know , 
and so you need to really work hard at helping your kids to understand that there is value just in work for itself without any pay , you know . 
 little  value just in whatever you do . 
 doing a good  job of it . 
jay , where do you live in texas ? 
i live in dallas , 
in dallas . 
 uh , right at the intersection of the busiest highway in the state . and a , uh , it goes east and west , and a north south tollway . 
what's that , the i thirty and central 
it's the looper that goes around the city 
 and then , uh , the tollway is called the dallas north tollway . 
just moved here about a month ago 
oh , is that right ? 
oh , how about that ? 
so , it's a very different house from the typical dallas , uh , 
it's a 
it's about eight years old , 
about eight years . 
 uh , it's a duplex type thing .
so it's different than the long texas ramblers . 
uhhuh . 
well we 
what's your house like ? 
cape cod style , i guess you'd 
oh , great , 
and , uh , have a big sun room on the back of it . 
so it's got a lot of openness and light , also ? 
 oh , it doesn't ? 
well , that's what my wife really wanted 
and so , uh , 
with openness and light ? 
i understand that , 
i would love that too .
uh , our last house wasn't too bad , 
but it was just too traditional , 
 and so , if , uh , 
this is very traditional . 
the next time , uh , probably a year and a half from now , we're going to try to build . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so make one really , uh , contemporary and , and very modern and very open and very light . 
do you have children at home ? 
oh , boy . 
at least two of them for the summer , 
you still need 
we have a lot less than we had ,
already cut back . 
how big is your place ? 
it's , uh , oh , about twentyfive hundred square feet ,
it's four bedrooms and two baths and that , 
we had four bedrooms , two and a half baths , uh , in the place we just left . 
so now we're down to , two and two . 
two and two , 
uhhuh . 
so it won't be terribly wonderful when the kids are home , 
but it won't be that long , because we , not sure , you know , how long they're going to stay or whatever . 
i was just reading an article , uh , that there were nineteen thousand properties available in texas , uh , for sale by the corporation ? 
oh , yes . 
and if you can find one in the right area you can really 
uh , we really didn't go that route and didn't look . 
uh , but , uh , the planning of them 
and the housing market probably still going to even go lower . 
there are for sale just by the regular route . 
so , uh , 
that's discouraging if you own property .
and we just decided , uh , uh , sell . 
and for what we had . 
uh , not as good as it would have been 
few years . 
but uh , that was just the timing . 
well our daughter and soninlaw moved back up here . he's from texas , but course she's from here , uh , about a year and a half ago ,
and they never did sell it . 
so they stayed six months , 
and she got her job back , and 
they're not moving very well . 
for sure . 
and that's a good , uh , example of it . 
they live in rowlett . 
oh , yeah . 
i know where that is . 
we've been here for twentyfive years . 
have you ? 
i'm from missouri , 
and my wife's from kansas , 
so uh , it's sort of home now . 
what college are you teaching at ? 
i'm at , uh , uh , it's called brookhaven college . 
it's one of the community colleges . 
and it's just about two miles to the west of 
so it's very nice ,
the only one i know 
now richland college it serves richardson and , uh , garland . 
garland , 
and that's about nine miles to the east 
so , uh , anyway , well , it's good to hear from you . 
well i enjoyed 
and i hope we , 
i hope so .
and , uh , have a good life , the rest of it . 
thank you , 
same to you . 
what are your suggestions in making a family reunion successful .
 have a big family , i guess , 
that's a start . 
well i guess so . 
well how old are you ? 
so you ha , 
i just got married . 
every four years on one side of my family they plan on having , uh , like my grandparents and all their brothers and sisters and then all their kids and grandkids . 
now how long in advance do they , uh , let them know ? 
it's like the third weekend in august , 
 so it's every four years 
and so , 
so they all know it . 
and then , you know , arrangements are made like during the summer for you know , um , food and are from down here , in texas . 
and , uh , a lot of my family is in indiana . 
that's where i'm originally from . 
so , um , we usually meet like at my uncle's cottage um , at the lake and , uh , make a couple days of it . 
well that sounds like fun , 
do they all have the small children too , that come ? 
so all ages . 
and then there are some a lot younger , about four generations , i guess . 
well my husband uh , on one side has an extended family , 
 and they don't ever plan it like you do . 
i think if you can count on it every four years then people have it in mind 
so they have to start talking about it , or getting their act together about six months ahead to get in touch with everybody ,
 and so it seems by doing it about six months ahead , they can pretty much get everybody there . 
and we're already locked in 
but six months ahead has seemed to be okay for them . 
uh , my parents are the youngest of very large families . 
therefore , they don't have many people left . 
and , uh , the few previous ones i've had , uh , 
i haven't known many of those people , 
but , uh , in the last few years it really has just been our immediate family 
and that's been very nice , 
with , uh , 
i have one sister ,
and they're only three out of five of us who have children . 
so , uh , we get to spend a lot of quality time with each other . 
 and that's kind of nice because my husband's family reunions are so large , 
 and they don't see each other very often , 
we don't really know many of them . 
that's kind of bad . 
it really is , 
they're fun , 
 but , uh , still , uh , they're not done on a regular basis 
and , uh , you kind of forget what happened , and who they were from the time before . 
it's fun getting together with immediate family . 
a lot of my cousins are real close 
and we always get together during holidays and weddings and stuff like that , 
uh , those are the ones that are in texas ? 
 uh , no , 
 or you go to indiana on that ? 
uhhuh , 
where in indiana ? 
lafayette , i don't know where , 
i used to live in indianapolis . 
it's a little north of indianapolis , about an hour . 
it's very pretty country in there i think , 
it's gorgeous . 
well i , 
uh , when is your next one , uh , scheduled now . 
 well it's like , the last one was my high school graduation 
the next one was when i graduated from college , 
so i guess about two more years . 
yes , well , 
and do you think you'll have a baby to take back with you .
 uh , maybe , 
i don't know , 
maybe .
two more years , 
i don't know , 
i mean you need another milestone , you know . 
i guess that's what , 
i mean i've been married now for about nine months 
so that was another milestone , i guess .
well i'm sure , 
and then all of your family probably has not met your husband . 
um , yeah , 
he's from indiana , 
 oh , is he ? 
 so they all met , 
your both living in sherman . 
do you work to t i ? 
uhhuh , 
and does he ? 
well , we don't either , 
but , uh , i have a friend who , uh , is working on this project . 
oh , really . 
are they getting all the data they need ? 
well , i don't know , uh , 
i have a hard time getting , uh , people on the telephone . 
oh really . 
uhhuh , getting through to anybody . 
sometimes i call off and on all day , 
but i got off that . 
 well we've kind of exhausted everything i guess . 
well , um , i think we have been talking probably about four and a half minutes . 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , uh , we both look forward to going to our next reunions , i'm sure . 
oh yeah . 
 but it has been fun talking to you . 
well you too . 
thank you . 
and maybe i'll talk to you again . 
what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation ? 
i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force . 
few are , uh , basically staying home and being homemakers , and raising kids exclusively . 
i grew up in , uh , sixties and early seventies 
and , uh , my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up . 
she didn't start working until i was , um , well into high school . 
so , it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids . 
well , mine taught kindergarten 
but she was always , uh , 
i guess her schedule was shorter 
so she was always , uh , 
always home by the time you got home . 
that statistic i guess has been growing every year 
 it's like something around  sixty , sixtyfive percent or so now . 
uh , i'm not sure what the future holds for that 
 it seems that there's  a grass roots , um , effort or whatever going on 
i , um , clean houses parttime , 
 and almost all the people that i clean for , believe it or not , are mothers that don't work .
that's unusual .
 they're all , um , 
i think it's kind of a new movement 
it's going back towards , you know , 
women have come into the work force in the last twenty , thirty years 
and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where , you know , women stayed home with the kids , you know , and try to give the kids quality time . 
and i think you're going to see a lot more , um , women choosing to not work after they have a baby . 
um , i think the salaries that 
a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are , um , vicepresidents of companies 
and i think with , uh , um , this , it seems like it's more the upperclass people , 
 um , i don't see it as much , i don't have children yet , 
but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids . 
but realistically i'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible , um , for middleclass people to be able to live just on one income . 
that is tough . 
we're looking at that now , 
my wife's about six months along . 
i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids . 
you know , it's going to or in the garage or whatever . 
um , and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever . 
i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home . 
i would think it would be women that were working fulltime . 
believe it or not though all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home . 
um , they're real active in volunteer work . 
um , one of the women is real active with , uh , muscular dystrophy . and , uh , does a lot of work with them on a volunteer basis 
but it's almost like a job , 
she just doesn't get paid for it . 
huh . well , i guess that's good that they've got something to keep them active . 
when your wife has her baby , is she going to stay home 
or is she going to ,
what do you think ? 
i would like to be able to do that . 
we think it's , uh , that important 
and i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction . 
i'm a counselor and a therapist , 
 and i work with adolescents , 
and i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure . 
even the generation before me ,
where the attitudes were a lot different . 
um , as far as , i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more , 
um , there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and ,
i think morally , um , it seems like higher standards . 
well , the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure 
and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too . 
so , kids are raised around their friends and by the media . 
that's true . 
and you know , that's contributed , 
and i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future . 
maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time , 
so . if there was some way to stay home even if they could work , you know , 
there are a lot of jobs that are coming about , like in computers at home ,
is going to be nonexistent .
what do you think ? 
that as far as 
do you think there's going to be still a family unit 
or do you think that , um , the trend is going more towards single parenting ? 
the  balance  
i don't , 
the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so 
and it got higher than that for a while . 
um , that's hard to say . 
families are such a strange configuration anymore . 
um , i see a lot of families where , 
you know , in the back , 
i grew up about the same time you did , 
 and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible . 
uh , nowadays it's not the case , 
kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk 
and one of the reasons , i guess , is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working . 
they get bombarded with junk 
and they don't have to do anything around the house . 
they never learned to be responsible when , 
the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while 
and they come back , 
and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad 
 you know , you create a bigger family , generation after generation but not really on purpose . 
so . it's not a real functional situation anyway . 
so , you know , i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families 
and the   families , as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society . 
the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore . 
  like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are , um , you know , two parent families . 
that's pretty sad . 
it is , 
i guess a major swing in the change of what's important to people , you know , probably keep going downhill . 
and i , i don't know 
that we can make it on one income 
it may be tough 
but we may have to give up on some things . 
i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that . 
and the strain worthwhile . 
i think so too . 
well , and wrap it up . 
um , it was really nice talking to you . 
well , i've enjoyed it , stephanie . 
and , uh , thanks a lot . 
have you grown up in dallas , stephanie ? 
uh , no 
oh , where are you from ? 
i grew up most of my childhood in germany . 
in germany . 
uh , and , 
 we took a lot of vacations while we were there because everything was within driving distance . 
now there's a place i'd like to visit .
so we travelled all over europe .
oh , that's neat . 
uh , i was grade school age . uh , 
or took a bicycle tour about five months right after the second world war 
and so we've seen lots of pictures of the beautiful ,
that's neat .
what kind of vacations do you like ? 
uh , well my husband and i are scuba divers . 
oh . h , 
so , we both like to go to dive resorts . 
uh , we went to hawaii on our honeymoon , 
 and we dove there . 
uh , but , we did about six dives while we were there . 
and , uh , we were originally planning on going to cayman ,
 oh , uhhuh . 
 uh , but , we weren't able to get enough people together for the trip . 
we had to have , like , eleven people for ,
 oh , uhhuh . 
uh , and we couldn't get enough people together , uh , to go , 
so it ended up falling through . 
we were going to get a really good price . 
we lived up in , uh , new york , 
 and we had a little collapsible sailboat and liked to sail and , that sort of thing , 
but we've never really , uh , did any diving or anything . 
little bit of , uh , uh ,  , oh , 
oh , really . 
but , not much uh , 
well , my husband and i both like water , 
 so any vacation that we go on is usually ,
it's got to be the water . 
when we were in jersey , we used to go down to the jersey beach a lot , and really enjoyed that a lot . 
they had ,
and i lived there for seven years . 
oh , i see . 
that's a really pretty area , too . 
we like the white mountains 
i went skiing once . 
 the lakes were really pretty close , you know , 
you could , 
and then we weren't too for from the appalachian trail , 
we did quite a bit of hiking , 
which is kind of fun . 
i would be you know , happy to go hiking , 
 but we never have really planned a vacation around , uh , places to go hiking . 
so scuba dive . 
i'm sure . 
you have any children ? 
then that's probably one of the reasons our , 
we had little children all the time , 
 so some of the things are not quite as , uh , adaptable . 
it's a little more , difficult planning a vacation ,
it is . 
you have to try to figure out kinds of things that you can do that they will enjoy , too , 
 so , i think , wha , 
and diving is something that , 
especially for small children , uh , 
i think the minimum age for diving is , 
eleven or twelve , i would think , probably 
but , maybe fifteen even . 
i know that , uh , uh , to vacation trips now is that usually that try to involve some of the members of the family . 
you know , we go wherever somebody is ,
so that's kind of , 
uh , we just came back from , uh , uh , grand rapids where we saw one of our sons graduate ,
and so that was fun , 
in salt lake area up by park cities .
that sounds like a lot of fun . 
our family had a reunion last year that was kind of like that , too , 
that there were several hundred , uh , people 
and they all kind of met at a central place . 
i didn't go , 
 uh , but it would have been a nice vacation . 
we've moved around enough so that we now have people in different parts of the country . 
i guess my favorite vacation idea would be to somehow figure out something kind of mobile where you could stop and sleep maybe , you know , like a , 
we've travelled in a big one . 
i hate them because they're hard to jockey around , you know , 
but maybe a pickup with the back on , 
like the volkswagen vanagon .
so you could kind of sleep in it sometimes , 
but you wouldn't want to do it all the time . 
uh , we have enough friends here and there , 
i would just love to just drive through the united states and stop and see people i know ,
my dad has been talking for years about , uh , getting a fifth wheel 
he's retired 
 uh , he's in his sixties , 
and he , uh , would like to just get a fifth wheel and just travel across the country and spend a month here or a couple of weeks there ,
i think , 
just see , see the rest of the country . 
and i would like to maybe not take great long trips , but have your home base , where your home is 
he does that quite a bit . 
he hasn't lately , though , uh , because he's been ill , 
 uh , but he's been known to be gone for a month or two at a time 
i'm going here , here and here 
and i'll be back in about two months .
there are a lot of neat places to visit in america , 
that's for sure . 
i haven't been much to the south , 
i haven't been in georgia or florida or mississippi or alabama . 
i guess those are the only states i have not visited . 
but , uh , up the coast , uh , where the early history is , there's some 
johnstown and , uh , in that area is just really neat , 
interesting things to 
so , you know . 
have you been to a lot of the different historical sites ? 
i believe it was . 
uh , had about three kids then i think , 
but that was a really fun , interesting trip . 
we read bruce   book before we went , you know , 
and , so we were ready to look up the places we read about . 
 and then eventually , when we have kids , 
now , his folks did a lot of traveling across country . 
you know they went to the grand canyon and did things like that . 
well , now , camping is fun with kids . 
if you're ,
once they get a little bigger , not teeny tiny ones , 
but , even some little ones do pretty good 
 , to , uh , cut costs 
and it's enjoyable , too . 
very restful . 
i mean i find , 
i do enjoy camping . 
i find the outdoors very relaxing and , you know , kind of a change . 
as long as i have a shower nearby , i'm fine .
well , i'm with you . 
i need my creature comforts , too . 
well , it was great to talk to you . 
it was nice talking to you , too , beth . 
see you later . 
what kind of painting are you planning to do ? 
and , um , it's a rent house 
and i decided it's too expensive to rewallpaper 
so i decided i'm going to paint . 
and i've been buying some magazines and stuff and looking at different ways to paint . 
and i'm thinking about maybe sponge painting them .
oh , what would be interesting . 
i've never done any of those fancy kinds of paint treatments , 
but they look very interesting 
and you get some beautiful effects with them . 
uh , one of the books that i bought , where it's describing the sponge painting , said you can like layer different colors 
i've seen that done , where there's uh , oh , 
i saw one that was kind on an ecru undercoat 
and then it had , a little bit darker sort of peachy color , 
and in between there was a sort of a rust , uh , put on very sparingly . 
and it gave the impression of very old weathered stucco . 
um , what i'm trying to do is i've got yellow tile in both the bathrooms 
 so i want something that's going to tie that together 
and i'm changing the fixtures out to make them wood , 
i'm going to put wood in there . 
oh , yeah , 
that should be nice . 
so it's going to have kind of a country look . 
um , and i haven't even decided as far as , um , what kind of paint to buy . 
i don't have an actual instruction book 
so i'm really in kind of the beginning stages right now . 
well , uh . 
um , it's going to be a big experiment . 
i was about to say , you ought to experiment on at least a small part of it before you just tackle the whole thing .
because you might find that it's beyond , uh , what you're willing to put into it .
i haven't ever done fancy painting 
but i sure did my share of just regular painting . 
uh , i've painted several houses , inside . 
inside . 
what kind of paint do you normally use ? 
well , uh , we used a latex , uh , wall paint and then a semigloss enamel for the woodwork 
and my job was mostly the woodwork . 
my husband would paint the walls and ceilings with the rollers 
and i got to do all of the masking tape and then all of the little fine , uh , trim work ,
well only one of our bathroom has a window in it 
so i'm hoping that , um , it won't be too much of a problem . 
um , i'm wondering if my bigger problem is getting the wallpaper taken down first . because i think , 
i have heard that they've got these steamers you can rent now , which make it much easier to get wallpaper off . 
um , i tried to get wallpaper off once twenty years ago , oh , with a just a scraper and wet sponge 
and it took forever . 
i would not recommend that method . 
uh , if 
well that's something that's worthwhile checking into then . 'cause i , 
if it's really old , you don't know what it's put on with . 
it's hard to tell , 
the patterns look like they're nineteen sixties style . 
and i know the house , um , was built around the mid fifties . 
so it may be the original wallpaper .
could be , 
um , if it's vinyl it should be easier to strip too . 
if it's paper it will probably shred . 
um , in one bathroom um , it's probably paper , uh , 
it's silver and yellow ,
um , uhhuh .
well the wallpaper that i was trying to remove was black , 
this was in a bathroom too . 
and the tiles were sort of a mottled grey and had a little trim strip of maroon and white 
and the wallpaper in that bathroom had a black background 
and then it had vivid , uh , almost neon colors of hot pink and turquoise , and lime green and silver , and , uh , a little bit of yellow that looked like coral sands and sea horses and things like that .
um , that's kind of an odd color for a bathroom . 
oh it was awful , 
it was absolutely hideous 
 and we had a dinner party before we started renovating it 
and a guest went in there 
well um , our , uh , comforter ,
um , and i'm not really quite sure , 
i don't know if maybe i'm biting off more than i can chew . 
well i'd say tackle one project first and see how it goes 
and if you discover you like it then you can always upscale . 
well the bedroom would probably be the easier of the two because it would be just plain painting . 
it wouldn't be any kind of um , special effects type thing . 
it would be just plain paint . 
well it's not hard to do if you get everything prepared ahead of time . 
because if you , uh , use drop cloths to cover everything and you use masking tape to trim out , uh , all the parts that you don't want to slop over onto , you don't have to be quite as precise about how you do it 
and it can be done a whole lot faster .
um , okay . 
you can wash up easily because they're water soluble . 
and they dry fast 
so you really don't have to be disrupted for more than about a weekend . if you have some help . 
and then when you pull it up . 
it peels the paint off when you take it off , 
well , not , 
if you leave it on for weeks , it will do that . 
if you take it up the next day it should be fine . 
you want it to get dry , but not , uh , just real hard . 
you don't want the gum on the back of the masking tape to get dried to hard . 
that's the problem . 
it will come up a lot easier if you don't wait too long . 
and i was told , 
i always used the nice wide masking tape , 
but i've heard from people who tried to get by and skimp on narrow masking tape that it was more trouble than it was worth .
oh really , 
and then you end up tediously scraping these tiny little shreds of masking tape .
and the whole point of using it is to save yourself work . 
you can do a little faster painting and much easier clean up if you use the masking tape . 
but use good , uh , stuff and buy it at a paint store where they have the right brands ,
well i really appreciate all the helpful tips , 
i think you just made my project a lot easier .
and i will tell you that i have retired from the painting business . 
the last time i had something done was my kitchen cabinets 
and i decided that was too much to tackle , 
i'd hire a professional . 
i'd tell you you could come over and supervise .
 well if i were closer i might . 
oh , well i hope your project turns out great 
and i , really think that it's exciting that you're going to try the sponge painting . 
i think that could give it a , 
well , we'll see how it goes , 
i may just be flat painting over it . 
well , of course that's the other advantage of paint . 
if you don't like it all you do is put on another coat . 
i guess we'd better go because our time looks like it's about up . 
i need to go to the dentist , 
it's was nice talking to you kathleen . 
thank you . 
i think i get most of my news , uh , in headlines from the radio , 
and then i followup by reading the newspaper and news magazines about things that attract my attention . 
well , i do about the same , i guess , but in a different fashion . 
i'm from new york originally 
and now that i live in florida , 
i live in the florida in the winter and then go back up north in the summertime 
 and the only legitimate paper  , although it might sound ,
i've always read the new york times when i was younger , 
and i try t , 
now that it has a national edition , i read that . 
i guess i do watch , uh , mcneil lehrer on p b s 
 and i guess i'm    , 
i like them 
but they take so long . 
i don't always 
well ,  there  
 , it's a whole hour show . 
actually , it's an hour show each evening , 
we turn it on when we start dinner . 
we seem to start dinner around six and finish it up . 
i find that i'm leaning on , uh , 
i travel a great deal , uh , even overseas , 
and i find that i lean on , uh , c n n quite a bit for concise and quick stuff . 
and , i'm quite satisfied with the way they put it out . 
i mean , i don't believe everything they say , 
but it's coverage , you know . 
i think c n n does a pretty good job . 
i had not watched them very much except when i was abroad ,
and they seemed to have the best coverage . 
they had more information sooner than ,
well , yeah , 
i , uh , 
peter arnet was reporting direct from , uh , iraq . 
i think 
he reported what he saw 
 and if you didn't like it , that was just too bad , you know . 
well , uh , i know that the coverage he was allowed to present was slanted , 
but i think they said that frequently enough . 
 i mean , uh . 
that's right , i think so . 
um , to magazines , i don't read , 
i used to when i was younger , 
i subscribed to time and u s news and world report . 
i have seemed to slide away from that and rely more on the local paper 
or , i also subscribe to something called world press , which is 
which sort of gives you a different slant , than , 
it's not as slanted as the new york times or as biased perhaps as the local paper . 
but , uh , that i guess , and the radio . 
uh , i listen to p b s radio a lot 
and i also listen to , uh , these twentyfour hour news stations , when i'm driving . 
we have a c b s twentyfour hour station 
do you read , 
i'm from , uh , 
 so  well , 
is that , 
palo alto . 
the san francisco paper out there is , uh , 
it's horrible . 
and that's a terrible paper . 
the san francisco paper is just wretched . 
so i subscribe to the san jose mercury news . 
is that pretty good ? 
palo alto is about midway between . 
but they're , uh , both run by the same peo , 
oh yeah , 
they really are probably the worse papers i've ever read . 
i , uh , uh , 
they're just horrid 
 so we read , 
well , can you get the l a paper up there ? 
but i don't like it . 
so we subscribe to the new york times 
 well that's another one i read , 
i forgot that . 
i read the wall street journal , 
not as in depth as i used to , because their articles seem to be getting even longer and longer 
well again , i read that , uh , 
i agree with you that the problem seems to be they don't have enough time to do all the stuff . 
i feel pretty well versed 
i spend a lot of time reading about these things . 
i'm quite interested . 
i find it very exciting for the coverage we have now , today . 
and i think we do get pretty good coverage . 
i don't feel that the american people is being shortchanged by uh , the news coverage . 
if anything , i think they list , 
we almost have too much . 
well , i don't know , 
and taking their word for it , or their comment , 
actually , i think they slant things 
well , i cannot stand dan rather . 
i remember him when he was a local newscaster in houston . 
no kidding! 
oh , wow! 
and i hated him then . 
i didn't know that . 
and i would not watch that man for money . 
and he and barbara walters just really turn my stomach . 
was he , 
 so i watch peter jennings , uh 
how do you feel about it ? 
i guess if the subject is do i feel that we're well enough equipped to , 
i don't know 
if it said that . i feel i'm well enough equipped . 
do we get enough news or something like that ? 
do we get , uh 
and i do . 
i really think . 
i think you got to segregate some of it . 
well , that's about all i have to say .
well nice to talk to you . 
well , we , uh , 
everyone thinks taxes are too high i'm sure . 
but , uh , i think we do get quite a good value for the tax dollars we spend in most cases . 
what do you think ? 
uh , yeah , 
i think so . 
or cutback on something 
and i don't know what to cutback on to , 
at this stage it's hard , to tell . 
so uh , for texas 
well , at this stage i think we've taxed property almost to the limit because ,
i think so . 
i know 
i live in richardson 
 and it's up over two thousand dollars a year for taxes on my house . 
but now we're getting public services , the schools , the hospitals 
and if it weren't for the taxes we're putting in there , uh , look what the schools could cost you . 
now uh , uh , oh , i , 
uh , to go for that ,
then again the community college system here is excellent for the dollar spent , 
and the public ,
one of the , 
uh , i don't know which one it is , uh , down there whether it's hobby or , uh , the other exgovernor down there that are proposing doubling the tuition . 
well if you double the tuition , it would still be considerably less than the public school tuition in most other states . 
i think that's right . 
that would provide , uh , possibly some relief there to utilize some of the property taxes for other things , see . 
the socalled  sin  taxes on liquor and the cigarettes and such as that generate a considerable amount , 
but eventually i think you may tax people out of smoking even . 
i don't know about that , 
well , i quit ten years ago 
so i , 
i see . 
no , uh , 
well , that would be true . 
i know , uh , 
my children would give up eating before they gave up their cigarettes i think . 
but all the various taxing authorities that come through , i think the one tax i resent the most though is the additional sales tax for dart which is probably never going to be in existence in my lifetime . 
your home to a business , for instance , you know . 
well , this is a thing 
i think it's like , uh , back east . 
you had to start your public transportation when you started your cities . 
you can't come in afterward and really be successful or economical at it . 
if we had been like a chicago or a new york city or philadelphia or someone like that ,
but now ,
and the other thing is that uh , business and residential patterns develop to take advantage of that . 
whereas tried to do the dart . 
and , uh , for instance in , uh , north dallas as opposed to downtown , 
uh , of business plus everything else that's scattered around here and there as opposed to having a concentrated business area .
just take like in chicago where the people depend on the public transportation system to get them everywhere . 
new york 
and some ,
someone made the analogy , uh , with texans as being like the old cowboys and their horse . 
an old cowboy would jump on his horse to go across the street . 
well , most texans will jump in their car to drive across the street . 
and i'm just as guilty as anyone else . 
oh , yeah . 
i drive to work every day by myself , uh , without even any thought of car pooling . 
 and , uh , most people are that way .
so , but i , 
we saw about them traveling to san francisco to see whether they wanted ten foot wide or twelve foot wide cars or something . 
i felt that was a little , uh , wasteful use of the tax dollars that we were paying , you know . 
a little bit much . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , the c , 
well , that's about all i can say at this time . 
i think so , 
i think that will probably do it , 
it's been real nice talking with you . 
good enough . 
uh , do you own a p c by the way ? 
i'm guessing you probably do . 
my , um , parents have one 
and they live just about three miles away , 
so we use that one . 
i see . 
and my inlaws also have one , 
and they're almost as close . 
they're in richardson . 
and what kinds of things do you use it for to them ? 
um , usually , uh , word processing something , um , such as , oh , forms for things , uh , 
also i have a nine year old that i've been home schooling for the last three years . 
and we got , 
uh , the one that my parents have is an apple two e . 
and i have a sisterinlaw who works in the fort worth school district . 
and so she got me copies of , uh , several of the apple programs 
and so we use those 
and there's some , 
whenever we go over and visit grandma the kids love to play the computer game , 
oh , sure . 
um , my husband has used the one at his folks house for mostly business things .
he's been applying for jobs and things ,
well , i tell you once you get used to having them you get spoiled really quickly . 
i'm , uh , 
my father had a software company , 
and they have a bunch of computers leftover from that 
 and we're hoping that they can put together something for us here that we can have the word processing ,
but , um , they're kind of old 
so i'm not sure that we'll be able to get too many other programs for it . 
um , a writer by profession 
and , uh , this is , oh , been like fourteen years ago we moved here . and i was finally able to afford a new typewriter , and i got an i b m selectric . i thought i had died and gone to heaven because  ,
i have one of those . 
well , then , um , 
mine's broke at the moment , 
ours really needs to have some work done on it 
 but then my husband , um , worked at t i 
the t i professional and brought that home 
and i learned wordstar on that , 
and , boy once that happened , there was just no way that i could ever go back to doing anything of length of the typewriter . 
i learned wordstar , uh , 
i did some typing for my father when he had the company 
 and so i learned that on there too , 
that was , 
have you ever used wordperfect ? 
that's the one that my father , 
uh , it's the one that's on my fatherinlaw's computer . 
he's got on i b m . 
that's probably where you've used it . 
uh , so that's the program that they're using there . 
yeah . um , 
i have that on my , uh , computer here 
and also , um , i do some work at u t d 
and , uh , that's what they have there 
and it was just so nice to be able just to step into the position the software . 
and , um , i don't know from my own experience , um , 
wordperfect is just so much better than wordstar at least the version of wordstar that i used to have . 
it may be improved by now 
that's what i've heard . 
uh , wordstar was never very intuitive to me . 
i mean you know , you , 
some of the commands just had nothing to do with , you know , computer 
but , uh , 
i mean like going , um , forward and backward a word or up and down a line that sort of thing just , you know , didn't match with the kinds of keys ,
you had to ,
but wordperfect is just a lot more intuitive in a lot of ways . 
if you do any kind of , uh , research or anything like that where you have to , uh , use footnotes , it is just wonderful .
oh , that's neat . 
and um , it just automatically changes all your footnoting numbers for you . 
oh , how wonderful . 
 so , you know , it's just , 
i had heard that that was better . 
and i think about how it used to be if you were doing a paper and you had to go back and retype everything , 
and oh , it was just awful . 
so , um , i don't know i think we have just become really spoiled . 
but i think ,
i agree .
so , um , well , i have not really paid much attention  because i  
although i think we've probably been talking at least ten minutes 
so , um , um , unless you have some other things you want to talk about as having to do with p c s . 
what kind of things do you write ? 
and my husband and i actually met in a computer company . 
um , i was a tech writer 
and he was an engineer . uh , so i did tech writing for a number of years . 
go talk to daddy about it . 
excuse me . 
oh , sure . 
tell daddy i unplugged it for you . 
but you don't need to drag it down the hall .
but , um , i have , 
um , that was the majority of my writing although , um , i have also done oh , free lance magazine writing and some educational writing . 
and , um , for a while i had an artist . 
so i did some advertising and p r 
um , i'm not working anymore . 
i'm a graduate student 
so i'm doing a lot of writing 
but , uh , now all of the sc , scholastic majors though , 
i've done a lot of different kinds , 
but i just know right now that i couldn't have put out half of what i did if that much without the being in computers 
so that's been really great . 
so i'm real spoiled . 
i'm anxious some day to have one here . 
and they just talked other day about setting something up again 
my nine year old i've decided to teach her how to type 
that's great . 
yeah . 
well , those are skills that she certainly is going to need early on 
and , you know , the , 
that's right . 
so . uh , d , 
we've been , uh , writing a story together . 
oh , neat . 
and i wanted her to put it into the computer ,
oh , great . 
and so i decided well , if she's going to do that , it would be a whole lot easier if she could type .
so we'll slowly learn just to type here and then 
that's great . 
well , that's a skill that she can use for the rest of her life , 
i agree . 
well ,  nola  i have enjoyed talking with you thoroughly . 
this is really going to be fun i think , 
and , um , my husband is a ham radio operator 
and i think about all the people that he talks to all over the , 
well , steve , did you go to college ? 
oh , that's good . 
so you probably could give some great advice . 
but in fact , i'm in the process of trying to choose a p h d school . 
well , what's your interest , 
your , uh , 
uh , well , computer science and cognitive science . 
that's similar to what , 
i'm in a p h d program right now . 
oh , i see . 
and , uh , my area of expertise , it's information systems , which is a little bit less technical , i think , uh , than computer science . 
but my area of expertise is , uh , uh , human computer interaction . 
oh , yeah . 
and i think that's one reason why i'm part of this study , uh , because i'm working with voice systems . 
yeah . 
so , good luck . 
a parent ? 
well , you know , the thing is , when you're a kid 
but , uh , i don't know , 
at the same time , you have to decide what is important about the school , 
you know , the size of it or , 
i think that's more important probably than even the career vocation , because most people change . 
i know very few people that , uh , started in one field and stayed with it . 
you know , they , 
i think that's what you just said , you know , having to do more with the size of the school , the environment of the school , uh , 
i think that's much more important . 
i'd advise a parent to send a kid to a school , though , that has a number of different types of programs , you know , 
that , uh , some of the smaller schools might be very limited in what they can offer , 
but some of some of the larger small schools , you know , i guess around three or four thousand students 
so if the kid does change , they don't have to transfer , 
or they don't have to , uh , uh , 
i don't know , they don't have to give up years you know , of credit transfer and things . 
that's disruptive . 
i normally , 
and parents hate to hear this , you know , 
because i actually teach college , 
uh , i hate to talk to the parents 
um one of the reasons is because , you know , the kid doesn't know exactly what they want , 
um , in history , uh , to be a salesman than someone with a two oh in business administration . 
oh , yeah . 
does that make sense ? 
i always , you know , tell them that you should major in something you're going to get good grades in .
i don't know . 
uh , give me five minutes . 
oh , you're at the office now ? 
at work ? 
uh , yeah , 
that's like what we were saying , though , 
would you , uh , advise a private school , or a public school , 
you know , what's the trade off there , 
i tell you , 
i live in maryland , 
and the public schools here are ,
i teach at a public school , actually , 
and i know that the s a t scores for our admitting freshmen are higher than a lot of the private schools . 
and , um , at a public school , 
and then right now i'm teaching part time at a catholic institution . 
oh , i see . 
i think i'm getting a better caliber of student at the private school , because i think their parents pay more , 
and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged , because their parents are probably college educated , 
where at the public school , i don't think as many parents are college educated , 
and i think because it costs less , the kid doesn't take it quite as serious , you know , 
it's the minimal cost . 
but i think you can also get a bad education at public or private , you know , 
you have to look around at the school . 
i think the bad part is that most parents or kids don't know what to look for . 
i think , uh , i would agree with that . 
in fact , i'm going through the same thing , where in graduate school ,
you know , a particular institution might be better 
 like , say , you know , the university of small town in arkansas or something ,
yet , if i go to u of i or c m u or , you know , you know , any big name school , my quality of education might not be that much better , 
but it's the same thing , 
there's , you know , what will the name recognition ,
does it have a big ten football team 
that's usually the basic criteria . 
is it a pac ten school , you know . 
but i think , 
see , this region , um , though i go to a smaller branch of the university of maryland , my diploma will still say university of maryland . 
 oh  .
um , you know , it doesn't differentiate on my diploma , though i would put it on my resume , what program i went to . 
but i think , you know , i'm actually at a smaller program , 
i'm not at the big college park campus , you know , 
that's the big one with the football team . 
so there's difficult decisions there based on name recognition . 
um , you know , when i first was applying for graduate schools , i applied to some big programs , you know , in this area , like stevens institute of technology , which is recognized in the northeast as , you know , one step below m i t in a sense ,
so it's got big name recognition in this area , a big science school , no football team , but a big science school , 
and technical people know that . 
but i don , 
i think you're right , 
you really have to think about that for the job . 
i went to a very small state college when i got my bachelor's , 
and when i , 
now , i was in education at first when i was looking for jobs , 
i was going to be a teacher , 
i was just a high school teacher , 
so most people recognized that institution because it was a teaching school sort of , 
and , you know , when i went into higher education , even at other universities , they weren't aware of it , you know . 
so i think yeah , 
that's important , 
um , .  think it depends on if you want a regional job or a national job , 
you need that first ,
it seems like everybody today is still in that   job market 
and , uh , um , where was i at ? 
oh , in going to school , you get taught the things you learn in school , 
but there is also a whole other dimension , i mean the growing up while you're going to school part . 
and , uh , actually , in the midwest especially , a lot of the schools like university of missouri , will have a main campus like columbia , which is big , multi disciplinary , 
and they'll have a satellite campus usually in a smaller town that specializes in the technical field . 
so you've really , uh , i guess sacrificed 
depending on your technical areas . 
yeah . 
i could see that . 
but , you know , i haven't even met , uh , someone outside of my area of information systems except for , 
does your family normally have a reunion ? 
do you have one , 
that's been , 
 on my father's side we've really there , uh , 
but usually sometimes every few summers . 
well , see , all the family lives in once place , except for a few of us are scattered about . 
so they're pretty much just reunited always 
 so it's just once in a while we get the special gathering with everyone together . 
well , it might be a good time for you to start a tradition . 
i know , 
that's  , 
you could be responsible for that yourself . 
  do that , 
that's true . 
how about your family ? 
well , in my family , let's see , last october was the forty fifth annual 
the first sunday in october , the jordan family gets together . 
oh , that's good . 
and all of the descendants of the civil war veterans come together , 
and they come as far away  from  california , 
and there's usually oh , between a hundred and fifty and two hundred and fifty people . 
and then where do you meet ? 
uh , there's a big community hall in vernon 
and , uh , that seems to be sort of a middle ground for all of the texas family . 
do you have relatives in vernon 
um , all of his direct descendants have now died 
and the grandchildren are in their seventies and eighties . 
so we're talking about second and third great children here . 
uh , well , i took them up until this year , 
they're grown and gone from home now 
 so they take their family . 
but , uh , let's see , 
that would make them , grandfather , great grandfather , great great grandfather , 
so it would be the second great grandchild . 
and so they , 
so this town hall that you meet in , is that like a , um , 
and , uh , you just bring the covered dishes . 
a dish of some kind , 
and you get all the wonderful old family recipes ,
potato salad and , uh , 
oh , that's good . 
and we choose to bring congealed salad . 
you can bring a congealed vegetable salad ,
and of , uh , sanitation aspects ,
i always ,
oh , that's nice . 
uh , that happens to be my specialty for that family . 
i do other things very well , 
 but there are others in the family who do them better . 
do they always have everyone thinks they know how to make this the best ,
well , that's good . 
 well   , i had a professor in anthropology at school who studied family reunions , 
so i learned a lot about them . 
i haven't ,
but we talked ,
you  all  equated the family reunions as ,
it was the protestant version of the catholic pilgrimage . 
it was an interesting theory . 
she talked about uh , the catholics 
you know , it's all family centered anyway , 
so you usually are living where your parents live 
and it's all , 
you don't have to come home , 
so the catholics would make a pilgrimage in older europe , 
but when the protestant ethic happened in america , there were people who ever went out and , you know , went away from the family to seek their fortune , and then had to come back home for their reunion , so that ,
but she had , 
it was interesting , you know , 
i don't know how valid it is , 
but she talked about that and how the big picnic table was the symbolic communion of the people gathering together , and , um , you know , about the bread and the ritual placement . 
do you have every year ? 
is there kind of a , you know , 
salads go first and things like that ? 
well , it's , uh , 
 and they plan the reunions , 
the organize you know , who is going to see to it that the coffee pot gets there , who's going to rent the tables , who's going to see to it that the silverware gets turned back to the caterer . 
uh , and each year it's done a little bit differently , because different people serve in those roles . 
well , that's pretty   .
we have a biographer who continues every year to save clippings on any family member , 
and they're entered into a wonderful , uh , scrap book . and pictures of new babies and new people who have been added and , and obituaries to those who are gone . 
and it keeps the family alive ,
sure does . 
that's wonderful . 
and they're very dedicated to that , 
and , uh , it's been really wonderful . 
it helps you hang onto your roots . 
i wish we'd , 
and it helps you feel a strong sense of belonging . 
my husband , on the other hand , was not very close to his family . 
his family was very scattered and very diverse . 
and i got to talking to him , 
i said , well , how is his nephew doing . 
"well , i don't know , 
i haven't ,
"i don't know ." 
uh , you know , my son keeps in touch with him , i think , 
but i don't . 
but i'm , you know , 
it's too much trouble ." 
so i got busy , got together , and put a reunion together for his family .
you're just , uh , 
oh , that's incredible . 
liked to kill me , because i didn't have that group cooperation , 
i did ,
and , uh , nobody brought covered dishes . 
we had a great big fish fry , 
and , you know , i fixed a salad in a number three tub . 
 and , uh , it was an enormous task to bring all of those people together with just one or two people helping . 
and , uh , we had to provide sleeping arrangements for all of them 
and i told him , 
we did it that year , 
and then the following summer , we did not have all of the family there . 
we sent invitations . 
it was when , uh , his step father had died the year before , 
 and it , 
his mother was alone , and so they came to support her , 
and then one by one , he began to lose family members , 
see , that's 
 we had a problem with that . 
and it was difficult to hold them together . 
and then , of course , he died two years ago , 
so , you know , that family has gone down to one brother and one sister now . 
and , uh , it , 
i think that's what happens when they get scattered , 
the family unit , you know , falls ,
was our problem . 
or the first , you know , major reunion was probably six or seven years ago . 
and then the second reunion , people who maybe , you know , had sacrificed things to come to the first one thought , oh , well , it's not that big a 
and so it kind of wound down , 
 and then finally , you know , you know , you get the shreveport relatives there , but no one else 
so that , 
well , see , keep the vigor alive . 
they'll send out news bulletins . 
two or three times a year you'll get a news bull , 
hey , guess who got , you know , elected to the legislature , 
or guess who our local sheriff , 
okay , 
my children as a matter of fact , are all grown now . 
so , i am 
oh , great . 
well my children are grown , 
but they're teenagers 
 so i have three children , um , ages fifteen , seventeen and twenty 
 and , um , when the youngest one was in kindergarten i started working at a preschool 
and then i took a couple of years off and then went back as a music teacher in a preschool , 
 so , um , 
well , i , myself , really feel like the structured day care program is more successful in today's environment 
uh , when my children were growing up , in a home with a lady who kept two or three kids , 
and i felt like that home environment was very important to them . 
it was important to me 
 and , uh 
oh , it is . 
in other words ,
they're dealt with ,
that's an interesting point of view . 
i , uh , you know , 
seeing the children in the school the way i do , we can always tell the ones that have not been around children at all 
 but still they have an opportunity to be with other children 
 and it is true , 
i think it's very important to have very caring people , you know 
oh , absolutely 
without a doubt , 
in a school 
i recently stopped by mcdonalds , 
and i was sitting out in their little playground while my granddaughter was playing on the things , and was visiting with another mother who was there with her children , 
and she was telling me that she was given the opportunity to manage a day care center , 
and of course , she had just gotten her degree , 
and she was so enthusiastic , 
and she was excited about it 
and she was going to accomplish all of these things 
however , uh , when it came to hiring and staffing people who cared and who were willing to take care of those children and spend that kind of time , the pay is minimal 
it is . 
 and it takes people with total and complete dedication who really don't want to make a living for themselves 
that's right , 
that maybe , 
that maybe have another salary in their family 
and that's what i had the opportunity of , you know , doing 
and you know , really having a lot of fun with the children and 
 well , they ask , 
they are to be there ahead of time , you know , 
they're there early to receive the kids , 
and they have to be there at sometimes six o'clock in the morning . 
that's right . 
which is , 
and then , then they have to work until the place closes at six p m 
and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day 
that's true , 
and , uh , she just had a terrible time keeping sincerely dedicated people simply because they could not live with a kind of hours and the salary . 
uh , and she , 
because people can't pay 
well is a church , 
and so the expenses of a building , you know 
we share the expense with the church , 
but we don't have enough 
 you know , taking care of a whole building 
so , uh , it is a lot different . 
well , i know that when my youngsters were small , 
now my older son was adopted 
so he went into child care at two weeks 
oh , my goodness . 
 and , uh , my younger son went into child care at six weeks . 
yeah , 
so , they were in that environment actually , up until they became , uh , seven and nine . 
and the after hours care has been as good a quality as i can provide for them . 
however , they're going out into the school environment now , 
they're under a lot of other influences . 
i need to be here for them . 
i need to be involved in their school , because i want to be the one 
so i quit working 
oh , you did ? 
i felt like that anybody who cared and loved the kids could change their diapers and feed them and bathe them 
but when time came to direct their ability to make choices 
so , i di , 
well , that's different than most people do it . 
i mean 
i know . 
that's right , 
once they get up in sch , 
but , uh . 
well , i just felt very strongly about that , 
and i did not work as a matter of fact , 
my son was in the second grade , 
please don't do that to me . 
so i knew it was time to go back to work . 
but i feel very 
that's true . 
uh , and i was just really grateful i only had one bad child care experience . 
it was in a home . 
uh , the care taker that they had had since they were infants just could not do it . 
she was from , um , uh , uh , argentina 
 and she was going back home , 
and i couldn't just , you know , wait for three or four months and then bring them back to her 
 so i had to find a new place 
 and i put them in this home , 
the kids cried when i took them , 
i could hear the kids crying when i went to pick them up 
oh , dear , 
they were always cranky and irritable 
oh , dear , 
 so i just took off and went there one day , 
and , uh , the children were left unattended in a room , you know , 
they were not well cared for 
oh , how awful , 
 but , that's the only bad experience i had , 
the rest of the time they stayed in la petite academy 
 and i was very pleased with their development and their progress . 
they learned a lot of things in those public environments that you just as soon they didn't learn , 
but they're going to learn it sometime , 
and it did appear to me that the people who cared for them had a good concern for them , 
and in one particular case they had a summer program where they were to be taken to the y and taught to swim 
oh , yes , 
however , my older son came home 
oh , gosh , 
oh , dear . 
it didn't take me very long to hot foot it over to the school 
and i promise you faithfully , i will watch the instructor every minute 
oh , good , 
so what were you saying ? 
do you work around children when you work ? 
i work with computers . 
with computers . 
they what , 
do you ha , 
one thing i , 
but you have friends that have children . 
what is child care like in new york ? 
what is , 
i do not really know , 
excuse me , 
too much about child care in new york .
does the company you work for have ,
excuse me one second . 
in fact my situation is a little bit strange , 
i was , uh , a student for many years , and then graduated and went and worked in france for awhile . 
and , i ,
oh , my . 
so i am just taking a little bit of time off right now . 
a sabbatical .
uh , and i might , 
well i hope you can stay as long as possible with it . 
well  hopefully  i can do some consulting work at home . 
and , if i can do that it will , 
oh yeah , 
i'll be able to spend the time with my daughter , and
it is a little , 
i miss the intellectual stimulation . 
but at the same time it would break my heart to give her to a stranger right now . 
i think it does when they are real little 
and they are changing every day , 
oh , yes . 
and you just miss the little things , 
and , uh , 
well , i do not think i would put her in day care for  joint   ,
i would not want her to be in a large day care situation so young .
that's right . 
maybe if i needed to work part time , like four hours a day , i might do that , cause like , you should get enough stimulation from you the rest of the time . 
but , uh , i just think that , you know , when there's two year olds running around , the care givers are going to pay attention to the two year olds . 
that's right . 
and only when the infant screams ,
that's right . 
and if not , the infant is going to lay in the crib all day , and maybe have a mobile above it to play with . 
and , you know , i play with her most of the time she is awake 
and i think that is so important . 
well it is important for the bonding that they do it ,
well , such as things for learning gives the child stimulation i think is important . 
and , uh , 
our oldest grandson , when he was eighteen months old went into a montessori ,
and they took infants starting at six weeks , 
and they have a program , uh , that was devised by this montessori person 
 uh , and a certain type of stimulations 
and there's times of day that even when the child is awake that they lay quietly and look at certain things 
they deliberately keep the room not real bright . 
they will put them down on the floor , 
and of course , they never have more than like five , 
 and they will put them down on the floor 
and i think one of them was a little mirror 
and some were just different objects that had a definite purpose 
and there's something about their eyes . 
well she's just been doing all kinds of stuff  where  she's , you know    , 
how old is she ? 
she's two months now , nine weeks . 
oh , yeah . 
and she's just drastically moving her eyes from one side to another and things like that . 
and she's just started that like yesterday or the day before , 
 so every days  are different . 
and you know , i think child care for infants is much harder than when they are older , 
and i will probably be going back to work around january ,
 a little older  .
and so i think , you know , she will be at a , 
i have heard it's a rough age to put them into a , 
it is because that's when they are clinging to mama , 
so you might have a real problem with that . 
i think it , 
 but i think it , 
so you know , it would be ideal if you could get somebody in so you are not really leaving the child in a strange place . 
we are just going to have ,
but that's unusual . 
uh , but i am trying to , you know , leave her a fair amount , even at this young age , with her grandparents , just to ,
my parents , 
my husband's parents are in france . 
so , it's a little bit harder 
but during , you know , 
she's met them already . 
not that she will remember them , 
but she's met them . 
that's nice when , uh , 
i have three grandchildren , 
another one coming in september , 
and i , 
if they were where i could not get my hands on them , i am afraid i would probably go crazy . 
you know , i like that , 
are they all nearby ? 
 but if , that's an ideal situation for you , is to stay with them 
or you can set up your work program and your husband's so that one of you is there all the time . 
that's wonderful for the child . 
well , if i work part time that might be doable . 
and what they offer , 
drop in at times that are unexpected . 
right now the situation is so tight at many places ,
but you know , since this is , 
people before they get pregnant are finding child care for the kids .
and , you know , i just find that incredible . 
and my sisterinlaw is going to have a baby very , very soon 
and she is intending to stay home with the baby . 
and , you know , maybe do some free lance type work at home . 
and so , if i go back to work on a part time basis , i am hoping i can leave my daughter with her .
oh , that would be wonderful . 
it will be a little rough when she is a very , very little infant , 
but like when she is a month or so , my sisterinlaw has had lots and lots of experience dealing with babysitting for large families . 
and so , uh , she might be able to do it a couple of hours a day 
and we might even be able to do it on a trade off basis . that i watch ,
we might be able to exchange that way . 
and so we will just have to see how things work out . 
but you know , ideally i think , uh , business should have the ,
i do too . 
they hire a couple of people 
and , uh , you know , parents come down to supervise or ,
really well trained people . 
and have some kind of real good program ,
oh , yeah . 
that's real important to little kids . 
well she's , 
my daughter does not seem to be on a real schedule yet , 
and it's probably my fault , because i do not have a real schedule now . 
they adjust to what the parents   .
well she's been staying up late at night and , you know , 
we , you know that works until they start school . 
and that's a problem , 
society is geared to a day person 
and it's , 
i have another friend whose brother and his wife have done this , 
they stay up until all hours of the night . 
why don't you go ahead first and tell what kind of car you'd look for in your next . 
i think an economy car that gets really good mileage and , uh , one that's really reliable . 
a brand new car , 
but maybe something like a nissan sentra .
something my husband , 
and , of course , it has to have airconditioning .
airconditioning and a radio , uh , a m , f m and a cassette player 
and , uh , what else do i want .
does it have to be a special color ? .
you know , a navy blue or a , 
well , i don't think we're looking for another car right now because we just bought one , 
but when we were looking we were looking for something that had enough seat belts , of course , 
and we wanted airconditioning and a five speed 
and that was kind of iffy , 
but that made it better economically , 
i think that's something we might want , too , is some kind of standard transmission 
we'll probably have to look for another second car sometime 
and we'd look for about what you're looking for . 
but probably real cheap , too . 
it wouldn't be a used car , 
but , no .
i think we would want one that , even though it was a compact car or whatever that it would still be nice enough that , uh , you could take someone in it and not be embarrassed .
would you like four doors 
or doesn't really matter . 
yeah , 
it's hard for people to get in with a two door sometimes . 
that's right . 
so if we wanted it to take people out that's a good thought . 
that hadn't crossed my mind . 
that would be great . 
all right , 
well , i think that's all that we need to say . 
well , thank you for calling . 
all right , 
we'll talk to you later . 
all right . 
uh , yes . 
and what is your feeling ? 
do you think this is vital important ? 
do you , 
um , i think that , uh , it's kind of discouraging to , uh , 
i have been involved in some political campaigns and that kind of thing , 
and it's really discouraging to be in a phone bank and call people and not , 
a lot of them are so ill informed they have no idea , you know , even that there's an election 
and it's the most discouraging thing in the world . 
i'm originally from oklahoma , 
and up there if they miss three elections , then they have to reregister . 
and i have often wondered if maybe that would help the situation . 
i don't know . 
well , that's a thought . 
well , can you come up with anything else that maybe we could do to these people ? 
i don't know 
i like that idea . 
um , oh , i had a thought just a second ago 
but it slipped my mind . 
oh , that's all right . 
um , probably one of the reasons that people don't vote more is because they don't know the candidates . 
and i think sometimes , you know , 
that's one thing that i have learned working in elections and things is , you know , sometimes even when you work for someone you don't really know what they're like . 
i know there's been a couple of people that we voted for and worked for 
and when they got in office it was just a disaster .
uh , and i'm not sure how you go about really finding out what people are really like before you vote for them . 
i'm not sur , 
the only thing is if they don't vote , they have no right to complain . 
it is , um , 
i don't know why we are so complacent , 
but i'm going to vote each time . 
right or wrong i'm going to cast a ballot 
and then if i'm unhappy with it , i have the right to express my opinion . 
that's right . 
so , uh , there was something else i was going to , 
and i'm like you . 
i've just lost a train of thought that i had . 
but they have been effective in oklahoma with having this program that you vote or you lose it . 
now if you just skip one election ? 
three . 
you have to skip three . 
and , uh , of course , they can be , oh , a long time apart 
but , um  . . . 
i think that's an excellent idea because then people really have to think about it . 
of course , 
and this is not one of our questions but what do you think of this no excuse absentee balloting ? 
no excuse . 
uh , i'm not sure if i'm familiar with that ,
i'm sure all over the state of texas now you have three weeks to go for absentee balloting . 
and you don't have to be sick , out of town or anything . 
there is no excuse . 
anyone can go and vote . 
oh , i think that's great . 
do you ? 
and sometimes it's nice to be able to go ahead of time and vote because , you know , if you're going to be tied up that day , uh , campaigning or whatever it might be . um , that just kind of takes that load off , you know , 
you can just go ahead and get that taken care of 
and  . . . 
but that is an excuse i could live with . 
but this idea of anyone wel , 
i am so bitterly opposed to this . 
if you're busy , that has always been a legitimate excuse .
but to have the expense of , 
let's see . 
they have five , six people at my polling place . 
they can come from all over the city , 
and i don't know why we couldn't have duplicate voting on some of this . 
well , hopefully uh , you know , once they've checked them off the list 
they do have to check them off a list 
i know . 
so hopefully they couldn't . 
but is every list checked as thoroughly as a , 
you know . we , 
back in , 
when i lived  . . . 
i don't know much to say about it . 
uh , it's , you know , 
for the balloon festival here in plano it was just gorgeous . 
i'm from plano also . 
are you ? 
it couldn't have been better . 
that's right . 
i mean , it didn't foul one launch , 
and that's kind of unusual , 
and it's kind of cold in the mornings 
so you dress up warm , 
but by , 
that's the only thing wrong i can find with it . 
i just got back from dayton . 
i spent the weekend in ohio with my family 
oh , how fun . 
 and the trees are changing color there . 
i miss that , 
so , that , 
as soon as we got out of the cloud cover . 
of course it wasn't sunny like it is here . 
it was real gray 
 but as soon as the plane got through the clouds 
and i saw all those trees , 
it just really made me realize how much i miss the fall . 
i don't complain weather wise though , because it was also thirtyfive degrees there yesterday morning , 
and the high was only fifty , 
and it was supposed to drop and get sleet in the afternoon 
 so it was nice to get off the plane where it was in the seventies . 
i guess you have to take some things and leave some things . 
that's right . 
i'm from utah area , 
and you know , they have tons of canyons where the leaves change 
and they're gorgeous 
you could spend every weekend of the fall going to a different area . 
we did that when we lived up in michigan . 
we went up to the upper peninsula , 
and they actually printed out maps of routes you could take so you would get maximum leaf exposure . 
and then on leaf weekends which is this time of the year , it's bumper to bumper traffic , 
people as 
whoever was driving could never have a prayer of looking at the leaves , because they had to keep watching the road . 
it's kind of hazardous for driving 
that's for sure . 
but i can't complain . 
i don't know if i've been spoiled . 
i've been thinking it's getting cold sooner than normal . 
we've only lived here a couple of years . 
i think it is , 
and my family said that in ohio there was just an article on , at the t v news that they are three weeks ahead of schedule 
everything just happened three weeks early this year . 
we'll have to see how it goes , 
a couple of weeks ago we were cooler than normal , 
but then we're back to being warmer than normal this week , or last week , 
just so we don't have one of those famous ice storms 
i don't have to live through any of those really , 
a bad , 
i mean , nothing comparable , i guess , to what you've had before . 
so i haven't been through 
so . i have in michigan , 
but in michigan you can get twelve inches of snow 
and life goes on . 
you're right . 
so , as i understand it here , if there's anything , they'll call off schools and close businesses . 
well , they get ice , 
and no one can drive on ice . 
i mean , we used to think they were pansies , 
but then when you decided what ice was .
the real definition of ice .
 so , well , i think we've discussed it good enough today . 
i think so . 
it was , 
it was nice talking with you . 
maybe we'll get the next time . 
take care . 
 my name's gail . 
i'm calling from texas . 
i'm sandy . 
i'm in texas , too . 
oh , what a deal . 
took long enough to find you . 
oh , really ? 
hold on .
seems like , um , to me , everything is just changing so much that it's almost like , um , you can't keep up with things any more , 
and everyone's striving so much to make it equal between men and women , 
i personally , i'm a stay home mom , 
and i like it the way it used to be . 
so am i . 
are you , 
you know , i think it's kind of coming back around to that , don't you , 
i mean , that there's a lot more people that stay home now than before , 
but i guess more than anything i think maybe people were just kind of wanting to have the choice of what they could do , you know 
i don't know , 
i mean i think sometimes some of the women's lib though , is kind of like they wanted it all , you know , 
and you can't have everything 
 i mean , there's no way i could have a career and then be the kind of mom that i want to be 
 and to me that's more important . 
how many kids do you have ? 
are they young , 
five and two . 
five and two . 
i have two , 
and mine are two and nine months , 
so , um , being home is real , 
i just am fortunate because i don't know a real lot of moms that get to stay home , 
and , uh , a working mom , 
and , you know , these people have secretaries and these high power jobs , 
and it just seems like , um , 
she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care , 
and , uh , i just don't agree with that . 
i think it should be that people should get back to staying home than not . 
you know , it seems like everybody's always so busy with everything that they're doing that there's no time for this and that and the other , 
and i hope it just doesn't get to where , you know , there's more and more women going into the work force . 
well , i agree , 
or , if they wouldn't be able to make ends meet 
i mean , i think it's got to be a personal choice , 
and , it's nice that we could have the choice to stay home . 
well i find that whenever i'm in a group of people and we're discussing things , 
like just over the weekend i visited my family , and some cousins i hadn't seen in a long time , 
and everyone's all interested in what everybody's doing , 
and , uh , you know , well , i had my baby with me , 
and i found that all i talked about was my baby ,
but it's like , you know , here these people are , 
they're going to school , getting degrees , making all this money , 
and , you know , they kind of looked at me like i was from the dark ages , you know , because i didn't have really all that much to talk about , uh , where career and things like that were concerned , 
and you kind of feel little bit like an outcast for a while 
which is too bad , because , you know , obviously i don't get paid for my job , 
but i should get paid at least double what my husband makes working in an office for staying home 
that's what i figure , 
i'm worth a lot just for what i do every day , 
but , you know , i don't know , 
this is kind of a , um , 
at least here i've noticed , 
i'm not from here , 
i'm from colorado , 
but i've really noticed that there are at least in the circles i've travelled and in the church that i go to , you know , 
men don't treat you like you don't know anything , generally 
well , and i think a lot of companies are realizing this and offering more opportunities as far as like job sharing or , you know , even having a day care on site and that kind of stuff , 
and i think that's really important 
and they realize there's a need for that , 
and , um , i don't know , 
i found when i did do some work when my son was young , it was like contract work , 
and it wasn't where i had to be there every day , 
but , i mean , we were going to the doctor once a week , 
so , i don't know how you could have a full time job and ever have any vacation time to do anything besides go to the doctor . 
i can see where that would definitely hinder the problem , 
do you see anything wrong with public school systems ? 
well , yes , 
um , i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to deal with in some quality way . 
i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job . 
i agree . 
do you ? 
do you have children in the public school system ? 
is that right . 
and the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much 
i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students , 
and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms 
you were a bookkeeper .
everything had to be documented , 
and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids , 
it was filled with documentation 
oh , no . 
well , um , i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back , 
and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what , you know , 
i love to work with children and 
me , too . 
but i'm really having questions and have a good conscience about , you know , what i do . 
i don't think it's the teachers , 
i think it's the system 
i think so too . 
 but , um . 
they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now 
and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best , 
she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder 
what child's going to say something 
that's right . 
i know . 
that's true . 
well , it's hard on the children too , 
i think , you know , because um , the teachers are overworked 
and just like a mommy that's overworked 
that's right . 
do you have children in the system ? 
one is in ninth grade 
and one is in seventh grade , 
and them , 
um , i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year . 
we , um , live in a district that has open classrooms , 
and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her . 
are you in plano ? 
i am too . 
you too . 
and i have one in ninth grade at clark 
and one at hendrick this year , 
and my , uh , sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews , 
and the very first year i taught back in seventythree , we had open classroom 
and it didn't work then 
 and when we moved down here , i was just appalled that they were still doing 
still at it . 
well the explanation i was given about , you know , 
they seemed to admit that it wasn't working , 
but they didn't have the money to restructure , 
but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with , i mean , some kind of partitions 
or just to face the children different directions or to do something 
i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school 
oh , goodness . 
 so he spent all day 
so , i didn't really care for that . 
it seems like the schools in michigan were much better than they are down here . 
were they ? 
that was our last tour , in michigan . 
well , we were from north , um , carolina , 
and of course north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education . 
i think they rank about fortyninth 
 but our children got a very good education there 
they were in the magnet school program , 
they changed classes several times during the day , which has its pros and cons , 
but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes 
oh , wow . 
 and it was wonderful 
it's ranked so much better .
that's right . 
we heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system . 
isn't that interesting , 
this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money , 
i don't know . 
probably so , on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are 
i guess so . 
well , my son is at clark this year too , 
so , uh , we're 
as a freshman ? 
and , uh , he's pleased with his classes . 
to know what to expect really 
my daughter seems to be having a good time , 
she was absent with strep throat the last three days , 
and i ran over and picked up her report card , 
and she did very good , 
well , that's good . 
she's not bogged down , 
but yet she has some every night . 
well , eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any , 
so , that's interesting , 
but , his grades , i haven't seen them yet , 
but supposedly they're good , 
you always hear how good . 
now my son's at ,
that's right . 
and , uh , i was thinking about it after i got off the phone , that i really , you know , wish that there was some way to , uh , send a message to people , you know , about , um , child abuse and things like that 
that , uh , 
those kind of crimes deserve some kind of severe punishment . 
too often i feel that people get off , uh , 
i agree with you , although i will say , 
i'm not sure , you know , 
i sometimes have a problem with some of the , especially more famous people who all of a sudden are crawling out of the woodwork to say that whatever problems they have , you know , abused as children . 
we didn't do anything like that 
an absolute certainty 
 you know , or if you know , i would have absolutely no problem at all 
i don't buy the routine , oh they're just sick , 
or they were abused when they were little 
 well , you know , forget that . 
well , sometimes they even wonder for crimes that are so severe 
and they play loony for a while , 
and then they're back out in public . 
well , but i can't see that either . 
i don't feel that that should be any excuse at all or any uh , you know 
oh , i agree , 
because we , 
uh ,  , 
so , my family may say that on occasion , 
who knows 
well , and too , you know , they can always be blaming the other person , 
i guess , you know , a lot of , 
and i was just seeing in the newspaper or the grocery store that some miss america was abused by the man she loved 
that's the new one . 
is that the new , 
i just happened to see the headline on it , 
and i couldn't realize if it was the husband or the father or what , 
but i thought , uh , you know , i'm wondering how our school system is failing , that they're not even seeing this , you know , 
if it was that severe that when they're later in life adults , that it's all of a sudden affecting them in this way , that it wasn't shown up at all when they were younger , 
and to deal with that yet , 
but still . 
well , you're right , uh , 
and yet , i mean , did you ever in your life when you were little know anybody or hear anything of anything like this ? 
 and i lived in california 
anything can go on in california . 
well , yes , 
but i was from conservative wisconsin  , 
and , uh , you know , there was , nothing on it , 
which makes me wonder , you know , if it's as , uh , prevalent as some of them claim . 
you just don't know , 
and it all , 
unless they're caught in the act or the child is very badly , you know , beaten up , it comes down to a one word against the other 
now , texas , is capital punishment for , 
it used to be just capital murder , 
and now they added mass murder . 
are those the only two things that we , uh 
i really would have no idea . don't really know . 
 uh , you know , because i have a feeling it is , 
and i think there ought to be more things added to it . 
that would be pretty lenient in my opinion . 
i , you know , uh , 
killing a child , or kidnapping , uh , 
and possibly not , well , 
i guess kidnapping maybe if the person gets very badly hurt , you know , 
if they release them two hours later , he probably doesn't deserve the death penalty , 
or like uh , i've heard when i , 
i'll just go with you first . 
what kind of 
well , i like dining out . 
of course , it means that i don't have to cook . 
but , um , i'm a divorced woman . 
i have one child 
 and , you know , when we dine out we go to like medium priced restaurants . 
i don't particularly , 
i think it's sort of a waste of money to go to a real high priced restaurant . 
we go more for the , uh , chinese 
me too .
mexican , 
uh , we do too . 
we do the same . 
what are your favorite places ? 
um , well , i like chinese food . 
um , there's a little place down on , what is that ? coit road , um ,  chinese pavilion  or something .
and i like it . 
and , um , i do like chinese buffets . 
oh , yeah . 
well , we've gone to august moon 
and we think that was real good 
 but our favorite when you have a little more to spend , is to go to taiwan or may dragon . 
and those are excellent . 
they're really a nice place you could take someone to eat . 
it's not the rinky chinese decorations 
 but it's a very elegant nice place to eat . 
very often we go out for fajitas . 
my husband has just gotten stuck . 
and we go to on the border .
and some of those and get fajitas , 
and he'll just eat chips until we've got three or four baskets coming back . 
and then , uh , last weekend we went out for italian also , 
and for some reason the cooler weather makes me tend to want to go eat lasagna and garlic bread .
so , we went to el sorrento . 
have you ever , um 
it was fun . 
that's real funny you said that because we were coming back sunday on central from church 
and bob pointed to it 
we're going to have to go ." 
oh , it is delicious . 
that's what he , 
in fact , you're about the third or fourth person in the last month that said that . 
so i guess we'll have to do it . 
you always stand in line when you go 
that's what 
 but it's worth the wait . 
d magazine said that . 
it said there was always a line . 
but that's a good sign . 
and have you ever tried , um , the macaroni grill up on , 
now , my kids didn't like it because they just wanted to get plain old spaghetti 
and most of those things were a little more northern italy . 
and they like just the traditional . 
they're not very , 
they're the spaghetti warehouse type . 
the place of the seventies .
but my little girl likes , uh , spaghetti warehouse 
most kids do . 
it's real entertaining for her . 
do you ever go for steak ? just a steak and potato and salad bar , that kind of thing . 
a steak is something that i cook at home .
 and i really don't particularly , um , 
well , uh , that del lincoln 
and , oh , what is that guy's name ? 
they do those real corny commercials . 
there's one over there in addison . 
i can't remember his name . 
anyhow it's some , 
there's a second one downtown , 
and they have these really corny radio commercials 
 but their steak is supposed to be wonderful . 
so , i had not tried that . 
my husband was saying that up north they have such nice restaurants where you can go after a theater or after the movie . 
and it seems like i've been , 
we found those one time 
and then they discontinued . 
it was over in addison . 
and then they , uh , closed up .
so most of these places are pretty much just , uh , theme restaurants 
i think that's what 
of course , you know , down , next to downtown up around mckinney and everything 
well , that's exactly true .
that's right . 
that's right . 
you know , it would probably take my whole paycheck just to go in and 
that's e , 
that's right . 
but , um , 
i had a friend who was taken to lawry's downtown 
and i haven't been . 
we usually don't go for beef really anymore . 
we've gotten so used to doing chicken and things at home that that's usually the way we'll go 
it's normally to get , um , some specialty type of food 
besides , you know , chicken and 
i know . 
well , i understand . 
they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant .
that's right , 
and save you some money too .
that's right . 
saves you a little bit money . 
 now what's your child's favorite place to eat ? 
um , favorite place , 
uh , she has a lot , 
taco bell .
oh , yeah .
they're easy .
that's right . 
that's right . 
well , mine enjoy that too . 
they like to go pretty much where we like to go 
and they'll 
 and then our favorite thing on fridays , we generally order pizza in 
so  we've  done . 
well , um , is there anything else you'd like to discuss about it ? 
i think it's come to an  eye  conclusion 
so i'll talk with you later . 
thank you . 
do you have a personal computer ? 
you do , in your home ? 
i do not have one in my home . 
i use one all day at work , 
but i don't have one at home . 
do you wish you , 
do you find you use it a lot ? 
micro computers one o one 
and we're just touching on data base , spreadsheets and word processing and just you know , different kinds of storage 
and we're just kind of touching on a basic 
what kind do you have ? 
we have an i b m compatible . 
it's a gateway brand 
well , that sounds interesting . 
what kind of a computer do you use at work ? 
i have a p s one i b m type . 
uh , and i use it all day at work 
and i put all my personal stuff on it at work .
so i really haven't had a need for one at home 
but probably if i didn't have access to one all the time at work , i'd want one at home . 
i worked on my airline apollo focal point computer for about four years .
but i didn't , 
what is that tracking the flights and things ? 
oh , okay , 
this is , 
have you just started doing this ? 
oh really ? 
oh , okay . 
but , i'm going to ignore that . 
that's a call on my other line , 
oh , okay . 
oh , okay . 
i have that , too . 
it's kind of a hassle when you have this , 
but other times it . 
where do you work ? 
i work at texas instruments . 
oh , you do ? 
oh , well , of course . 
of course . 
well , no , 
i'm already home for the day . 
oh , i see . 
well , this is a pretty good deal . 
you know , i can't do it at work . 
i work in the legal department 
so i'm pretty busy . 
but i use my p c there mostly for creating legal documents . 
we use word perfect , lotus . 
oh , that's great . 
that's something we want to learn . 
it's really , 
i love lotus . 
i think that's about my favorite . 
i've heard that people that finally learn how to use it really like it . 
that's great . 
it really is , 
and i know there's still a hundred things i don't know how to do on it . 
but , uh , you know , you learn something every time you use it . 
i have a question . 
oh , i see . 
well that's 
well , that's a pretty good deal . 
from what i understand . 
so why are we doing this ? 
it's for research . 
actually , i'm doing this you know , for a friend of mine . 
it's a research type project on 
to , uh , 
it's , uh 
it's almost like that , 
 well they call it the speech lab that is setting this thing up . 
they're doing research for a lot of big companies from what i understand on this . 
now i don't know , 
well , that's wonderful . 
but they , uh , try to get as many people as they possibly can to contribute to this 
and that way they can check voice patterns . 
i see , 
different kinds of voices and things . 
and get the computer where it recognizes voices . 
see that's why i'm going to say you have an accent .
well , i probably do because i've , 
and i think that i don't . 
i mean to you 
you know . 
well , i was born and raised in texas . 
have lived here forever 
so i probably do . 
and you're in what city ? 
i'm in richardson . 
it's right outside of dallas . 
one of my sisters lives in plano . 
and that's right outside of , 
well , richardson's right between dallas and plano . 
how about that . 
i probably went through richardson , then . 
you probably did . 
and then i have a sister that lives in austin . 
well , what are you doing way in washington ? 
well , we're actually all from nebraska . 
they just are recently moved there . 
my brotherinlaw is director of admissions at the university of texas 
well , that's interesting . 
and then my sister works at the air force base . 
so i imagine they use personal computers . 
actually , yes , 
do they do their correspondence on it ? 
as far as i , 
mostly my one sister uses hers for her children .
well , what i believe is one of the major uh , things that is wrong with our public school system is that , um , we do not have enough discipline 
 and the parents do not let the teachers discipline the children the way that they need to be 
i agree with that . 
uh , when i went to school , i know i was scared to death 
you were ? 
and the discipline that my daughter receives now 
you know , i did not see anybody in my classrooms , when i was going to school , act up the way that kids do 
from what i understand , they act up pretty bad .
that's right , 
what , uh , grade is your daughter in ? 
my daughter's in the , um , fourth grade 
 and , um , there's children in her classroom that just totally disrupt 
 and when i went to school that just wasn't put up with . 
oh , no , 
they always had a paddle in our school . 
well , they just don't do that any more . 
i know . 
but the school system's afraid of getting sued 
and , i also believe even though i feel like i pay a good share towards the school system , that the teachers are still underpaid 
and we still don't have enough money towards 
and , um , i think that if we had enough money and paid the teachers a little bit more , that maybe that could solve some of our problems . 
wasn't that what part of the lottery is going to go for , if we 
you know , i don't know your feelings toward that . 
i guess we shouldn't get into that 
i think in some ways that they need to be more careful of the teachers that they hire . 
i have heard stories , uh , from other parents that i know of , their children are in high school 
oh , yeah , 
high school teachers 
 and , you know , to be more careful of the teachers that we place in our school . 
uhhuh . um . 
um , that's basically about all that i know that may be wrong with the school system . 
with what they have to work with , i think they're doing a pretty good job right now . 
oh , i do too , 
but , then , what do i know , 
so this is probably a real hard subject for you . 
oh , yeah .
well , i guess , um , we can discontinue our call now . 
it was a joy in talking with you . 
well , it was good talking to you too . 
we'll see you , 
well , what do you know about latin american policies ? 
 well , i think they're kind of ambivalent , really . 
uh , i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations 
half the time we don't know who to support . 
that's just it . 
it's got to be tough , 
but , i mean , uh , uh , you still have to , you know , let them know how you feel . 
i guess my concern ,  , we're going to have supporters and we're going to have , uh , antisupporters , i guess , for lack of better term , 
and , uh , like you said , they're such small countries , that we're bound to upset somebody , 
but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance . 
it worries me that , uh , the economy of so many countries you know , like cocaine 
that's true . 
and it , 
i don't think that , 
maybe it's , you know , i'm reflecting how i feel about it , 
but i have a feeling the competing factions in lot of those countries 
and it's still going on , 
and , uh , we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how ,
that's about the lump sum of it . 
well , um , i was speaking with a woman 
i believe she was from the honduras or guatemala , or somewhere in there , 
she was from el salvador 
 and , uh , she was from a relatively wealthy family , 
and when , uh , the contras came into power , of course with , 
uh , oh , gosh darn , what's his face , 
he's in florida jail now , 
marcos 
 uh , no , 
marcos is philippines , 
um , well , i'm blank on it . 
well , you know who i'm talking about . 
i know it , uh , 
anyway , when he came into power , he basically just took everybody's property , you know , just assigned it to himself . 
kind of nationalized it 
uh , so she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect , 
and in that respect i have to agree that i think we're taking the right stance 
basically a dictator fascist . 
and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing , 
it just 
well , what do you think of , uh , this , uh , u s free trade agreement we're working on with mexico ? 
well , i think it's long overdue 
 uh , i just , you know , 
there's so much difference you know , i have a problem , uh , with whether it's going to work or not , you know , 
uh , it seems like there's , 
and i , 
this may be unfair to mexico , 
but it seems like there's a lack of honesty in foreign policy a lot of the times . 
the mexican government is trying , 
and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to , oh , make themselves americanized , i guess 
the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule 
and it's what's really hurting , uh , the mexican people , because they've had their way of life , 
and we've had our way of life , 
and , uh , 
i think their version of the good old boy network going that , 
uh , you know , has a lot , 
well , let me just start by asking what you think of this middle east affair we've got going on ? 
i think that it's time that we concentrate more on what's going on within our own borders than what's going on in the middle east . 
i have to agree with you there . 
we shouldn't have too much of a real interest in deciding whose land it is . 
just let these people fight it out 
i agree . 
 you know , we've got so many domestic problems , 
and what does it cost these people over there , you know . 
oh , so how about the soviet union . 
what do you think's going to happen there . 
the break ups ? 
i think that's great . 
um , i'm glad to see that , 
but i don't know , 
i'm a believer in the old adage that if somebody earns something it's worth more to them than if you give it to them , 
and so , i'm not much in favor of it , 
but i'm glad to see us advising them 
that doesn't seem to cost a whole lot of money . 
that's right , 
but i'm ready to have a president elected that at least has some sort of a domestic agenda , 
even if it doesn't work , at least he is somebody who is working on that problem . 
and i haven't seen that in the last eleven years , 
well , all i've seen . 
reagan obviously wasn't too concerned with the domestic side of his political affairs . 
i think bush's kind of followed suit . 
um , international is important , 
but , uh , we've got a budget deficit that just won't go away unless it gets seriously addressed . 
uh , you know , and then there's the homeless issue , 
and there really is a lot we could be doing stateside without , uh , hurting our international aspects or straining any international relations i think , 
and we wouldn't have to spend the billions and billions of dollars each year that we're spending . 
oh , i agree . 
and i think there's a limit , 
and we passed it a long time ago . 
i agree . 
we've been writing off way too many bad debts 
that's another thing i don't understand is things like selling technology and , uh , even military hardware to foreign governments and then forgiving their debt 
 to me that just doesn't make any sense , 
as much in debt as we are 
i know it . 
i don't know . 
i think it's definitely time for a change , 
but i don't see anybody , 
i don't understand , too , why we have to have democrats and republicans , 
and it's either one way or the other , 
you either do it this way 
or you do it that way , 
and there's no in between 
that's right , 
you're either liberal or you're conservative , 
 and uh , it obviously isn't working . 
well , i think , uh , it wouldn't hurt , 
and i know the independent party's been trying for years to get uh , in congress , 
but , uh , you're right , 
there's just too many issues that come up that , uh , our senators and our congressmen vote on simply because it's a democratic issue or it's a republican issue 
oh , yeah . 
 and if they would vote with their conscience and with what their constituents feel , i think , uh , we might have a lot more efficient running government and a lot better laws passed . 
oh , i agree with you . 
well , of course , you know , we have the national embarrassment in our state , jessie helms , 
and , uh , as soon as we can get , 
of course it seems to me that every time he opens his mouth , he just lines up people against him 
he's , uh , usually on the ninetyeight to two side , 
he's the one of the two that votes , 
well , let's see , 
 and , uh , when did you guys vote him into office ? 
oh , unfortunately nineteen ninety . 
oh , you're stuck . 
we're stuck with him for 
but , uh , unfortunately for him , but maybe fortunately for us , his health is not great , 
so , i hate , 
well what do you do on your yard ? 
well , uh , typical lawn stuff . 
saint augustine , uh 
 uh , and really all i do to it is , 
uh , in fact , i didn't even fertilize it this year , 
i just mowed it , 
and the particles fall down 
comes back in the yard 
 so you don't have any one do your yard . 
you do it yourself ? 
we do too . 
have a lot of people trying to do it for me .
isn't that the truth . 
a flyer's on every door every day . 
hey , i need the exercise , 
so what the heck . 
that's right . 
well , my husband does the same thing , 
he does the yard , 
and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower , 
but i keep putting off learning . 
hey , you've got the right idea . 
that's right . 
but i had recently gone out and planted mums . 
we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago , 
and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's 
and put out yellow and bronze 
and they're just gorgeous , and so then last week my mom comes in town , 
so the first night , that around halloween 
and we went out and covered them with a sheet , 
and they did okay that first night . 
but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it , 
so i guess i've lost them . 
i haven't gone out to check yet . 
i don't blame you . 
i wouldn't want to look at them . 
but , um , the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here . 
i guess it was about four years ago . 
and we did not know in august to put down the , uh , whatever it is for grub worms . 
and the next spring , i guess in that march , every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed , we'd have big whole patches come up . 
have you ever seen it 
and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it , 
it would just come off in the rake , down to the dirt . 
so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything . 
it took a lot of money and a lot of time , 
so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon . 
oh , yeah , 
we found them . 
we dug under there about an inch 
and you could see them . 
they're real fat little white things , 
those kind of brown , uh , ju , 
but in the , 
 and some people call them may beetles . 
june bugs is what i'd heard them called , 
so any how , occasionally i find them in the flower beds . 
they said that every yard has some 
uh , yeah . 
 but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem . 
so that's the number one thing we do , whether we fertilize or anything else , just because we got burned so badly before . 
well , i had some of that problem , 
but mine was freeze . 
oh , yeah 
that too , 
two years ago , or last christmas 
i caught wolfe with , uh , uh , uh , one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents , 
and , uh 
oh , yeah . 
i guess you did too . 
it's what they've done in the spring 
uh , well , i put , you know 
that was late , 
that was like , 
because i started to say , there's different times they say it's okay to do it . 
that was like september , i think . 
and i had to water it , you know 
keep it damp . 
well , my , 
out here , you know , we don't have as many trees in plano , 
at least the area where , 
we're over by collin creek mall , 
but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front , like the pittosporum all died , 
and all those variegated , uh , things died . 
so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly , 
and they just live , 
they're pretty tough , uh , 
you can stand those . 
pittosporum is kind of borderline here 
 and usually it'll do pretty well , 
but , uh , you know , every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals 
 and it zaps it . 
well it's kind of like one of these , 
oh , wax leaf ligustrum is the same way . 
they warned me of that one finally . 
and we didn't know the difference . 
and every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before . like about these mums . 
next year , i'll do pansies . 
your list is growing , 
and my backyard , we had it really nice , 
and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy , 
and so , it was about , 
i guess he's three now , 
so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants 
oh , yeah , 
oh , gee . 
so , it's like our backyard is just kind of like , 
as long as he won't damage it , fine , 
and if there's anything he'll hurt , we just don't put it out there any more . 
kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds , 
very much , 
but , uh . 
i had a small vegetable garden that , uh , 
you did . 
it did pretty well , 
it's like on the 
 and , uh , you know , from the alley 
so do ours , 
 and , uh , it's a little piece of land over there .
what did you grow ? 
well , i had , uh , tomatoes and , uh , uh , peppers , 
and i had , 
that is amazing . 
and by the fence i had cucumbers , which didn't do real well , uh 
they kind of came out looking like gourds . 
 well , put them in a salad , though , 
but i had squash , 
i had zucchini and yellow crook neck squash , 
um i guess my initial view is our tax burden hasn't gone down in recent years despite tax cuts 
 but among industrialized nations we have one of the lowest in the world , 
and in   
of the matter , 
you get what you pay for , 
if we're going to have national health insurance , which seems likely , it's necessarily going to involve more taxes . 
uh , the economy , that most other countries have a higher share of the tax burden in various kinds of sales taxes , uh , energy taxes , particularly , and that to the extent we need to raise more taxes , that's the direction we should look . 
well , i guess i kind of have mixed feelings .
um , you know , you always sit there 
and out of each pay check so much comes out of it , 
 and we have such a huge , uh , national deficit , 
i know there's a lot of social programs out there that need help . 
well , one of the big tax that has gone up a lot in this year is the social security tax 
but that is a particularly regressive tax , uh , 
it's a tax on the first dollar earnings , 
and senator moynihan's , uh , proposal makes a lot of sense . 
i'm sorry , 
i couldn't . 
i think senator moynihan's proposal up the social security program could make a lot of sense . 
i agree with that . 
as far as other countries , you know , as what they're do . 
i know 
we were in ireland last year 
 and i know that the tax there is extremely high , much higher than we pay here , 
oh , yeah . 
i think japan is probably about equal to ours 
 and other major countries are higher . 
our friends were amazed that the cost of things when they went to canada not so long ago . 
and , as a whole , most other countries have a higher level of cradle to grave government services , 
they're real tradeoffs there . 
 and you sit there and wonder , um , 
uh , i , 
no real knowing about . 
uh , there's a lot of inflation risk that isn't taken care of in most private pension plans . 
that's true . 
but , um , are you involved with the legislature up there , 
or which , 
i was just wondering since you said washington d c , 
and you picked this topic , 
i was just 
well , well 
i didn't pick it , uh 
oh , you didn't . 
 i mean , um , like i don't really recall . 
i may have filled out on the form , 
but certainly have the feeling i've been given topics different from the ones that i mentioned before . 
oh , did you . 
see , i haven't placed any calls . 
did they automatically assign the topic ? 
oh , i didn't 
i thought whoever made the call could choose what topic , 
because i haven't made any calls yet . 
i've just received some . 
oh , you should try it . 
oh , i didn't realize that .
because it can be a rather controversial subject depend on who you're talking to . 
uh , many of the subjects are . uh , taxes especially . 
um , one thing that has kept our tax burden high , and this will change somewhat in the next few years of the defense budget 
 and that same subject , 
my name is donna , 
and i'm calling from plano , texas . 
this is laurie , 
and i'm in garland .
oh , okay . 
um , would you like me to go first ? 
okay , um 
i have three children , um , two who are in regular school , uh , eleven year old , an eight year old , 
and then my little one , three year old , is in , um , a university of gymnastics , 
it's a preschool 
 and , um , i think it was really hard um , to pick the right , uh , day care or preschool or mother's day out . 
i guess you can classify them all together . 
um , some of the qualifications that i look for was uh , you know , the cost , and , um , exactly what they did , if it was structured or nonstructured , if they had a little academic , um , uh , in there , and , um , you know , um , you know , what the qualifications of the teachers' were , and if the place was clean and 
and , um , just kind of going by word of mouth and finding out if anybody else has been pleased with their program 
well , we don't have any children , 
but we're going to have one next year .
oh , congratulations . 
so , um , that's something that i'm probably going to be looking at 
we haven't quite decided if i'm going to , 
i'm working part time now , 
and i don't know if i'll be doing that or what we're going to do . 
or staying home . 
but if we do , then i'm going to need to find somebody , 
and our church has a mother's day out program 
and we know a lot of people at the church 
so i would feel very confident with leaving 
that's a very good place to start i think . 
the mother's day out programs , 
and that's where shannon had started , in a mother's day out program 
 and , uh , the churches always have i think , a pretty good program , 
and you have to make sure a lot of places have very long waiting lists . 
um , and another question to ask is if they're , um , state certified 
um , you know , what kind of a structure is it going to be . 
um , when your child's a little bit older , like a three year old 
is there like a mandatory nap time ? 
time , uhhuh . 
what they do at shannon's school is have a video tape going , 
and they lay on these little mats , 
and if they fall asleep , they kind of let them sleep , 
and the teacher stays with the sleeping ones , 
and the other ones get up and go do something else . 
so , she doesn't have to necessary take a nap there 
um , you know , it's kind of scary , i guess , because you hear so many bad things about day cares 
that's true . 
and so , i guess it's such a growing concern , 
but then there's a lot of good things you don't hear . 
and sometimes when the child's a lot younger , um , before three years old , you know , like the church is a good program 
and sometimes you even consider , um , you know , having a private person come to your own home when they're real little or 
and another consideration is of teachers to 
to children . 
because that makes , a difference , 
and if your child would be maybe sleeping in that crib all day , 
just your child , or do they just put any child in any crib 
you would want , maybe , your child to have their own sheets all the time , and not have another 
i'm sure that , um , whatever you decide , you'll be happy with . 
and it's exciting time to have a new one .
we're pretty excited . 
i bet . 
that's wonderful . 
but you know , we have been thinking about that , 
but it's a little ways off in the future 
 but , um , i figure , you know , i'd probably start asking 
asking . 
some places take them as infants , i guess , you know , like eight weeks , even . 
um , there's a place to look into , um , um , 
a friend of mine who's a nurse on fifteenth street , 
it's in plano somewhere where , um , 
nurses that used to work in the hospital take care of infants and then only up to like two years old 
 and a , 
you know , some places just specialize in just real little ones 
 and then other ones , uh , are the older children . 
but it is a difficult situation , i think . 
when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry , 
my name is donna , 
and i'm calling from plano , texas . 
i'm jay in dallas . 
oh , okay , um , 
i , um , find exercise kind of a task , i guess i'd say . 
i go to aerobics two days a week , 
but i also have three kids at home 
so they keep me pretty busy . 
that keeps you plenty of exercise   .
but i enjoy , um , bicycling once in a while with the family . 
excuse me .
that's fine . 
and yourself . 
well , uh , i have , 
i walked and run um , almost every morning . 
i've sort of stopped here with the weather change , 
but , uh , it's about a thirty minute exercise every morning . 
every morning . 
well , my husband swims every day at lunch , which he loves doing 
oh , that would , 
that's fantastic exercise . 
he does it every day like a ritual . 
once in a while or if he has a business meeting or if he'll not go , 
but he goes , um , every day , 
and then he's a runner , too . 
he runs three mornings a week 
he gets up about five and 
and some days he doesn't , 
but then maybe he'll catch up on the weekend and go for a run . 
all right . 
and , um , we   .
i'd rather get a bicycle , 
but i had an exercise bike in the house , but didn't seem to use it enough , 
so somebody sold it in a garage sale , 
the bicycling is nice especially with the weather around here , 
and i know , um , uh , do it to just keep the pounds off . 
we're getting up in age , i guess , in our late thirties 
so we need to 
it keeps going , 
because i'm fiftyfive , 
and uh , it just gets worse . 
you still want to eat , 
oh , i know . 
i think you feel better , too , if you get on some program like that , 
but , uh . 
i go to this aerobics class two mornings a week , 
and i take my three year old with me . 
there's a nursery there . 
and it's kind of another day out for her 
and , um , i enjoy the socialization of it , you know , 
getting to see the same women every 
i know some of it is so tough 
it is . 
 and , uh , especially when somebody's , uh , planning lunch for you and they know what's good for you , 
i think when we do it ourselves , 
we take the easy way sometimes . 
that's true , 
so anyway 
thank you for calling . 
thank you for participating . 
all right . 
thank you . 
well , uh , guess it's logical to ask , do you exercise any ? 
i'm about the same way , 
i do a little bit . 
my job kind of hinders me from exercising . 
i'm a night operator here at a industry down here 
and i don't really get out a lot to exercise . 
well , i , uh , am an assistant teacher uh , in business technology 
and i think the most exercise i've gotten in the last three to four month is jumping up and down to go answer the kids' questions . 
it keeps me pretty busy , 
but it's not really the kind of exercise that gets your heart rate going . 
and , uh , you know , it really , 
exercise is so important . 
it is . 
and i realize that . 
that's the way i feel . 
i'm used to being in pretty good shape because when i was in high school i stayed in pretty good shape , played a little basketball and stuff like that , 
but i've got , 
now , i'm in college 
and i go to school during the day and work at night . 
i can tell that i've not really done a whole lot . 
when you , uh , exercise , what do you do ? 
well , uh , i usually play at home . 
we live out in the country 
so me and my brother play basketball and have a bunch of guys come over and play 
or a lot of times we're up at the church 
we'll play volleyball 
stuff like that . 
i got a hold of , uh , richard simmons' tape , uh 
oh , really ? 
what is it , uh , 
i can't even think of the name of it right offhand , with the oldies . 
oh , the sweating to the oldies ? 
sweating to the oldies , *[[title
and that's not bad . 
oh , really ? 
that's pretty upbeat , 
so , you know , every once in a while i'll put the cassette in and go with it . 
not often enough to have a routine .
my little schnauzer wishes i would get out and walk with her . 
oh , really ? 
but , uh , i don't know , 
by the time i get home , all i want to do is just collapse or sit down at my computer 
and my fingers exercise more than anything now . 
that's the way i am . 
i just want to sit down and relax . 
too tired to exercise . *[[slash error
uh , do you ever ride a bike or anything like that ? 
i started riding my bike about a couple of months ago 
and i'd ride about two or three miles a day , 
but it would last about a couple of weeks 
and it got real cold for a little while 
so i gave it up . 
here , about the most common exercise for people is to go to the malls and walk , uh , 
walk around . 
because they're enclosed 
and no matter what the weather is they can walk 
i've noticed people doing that down here , too . 
i'll be in town or something 
and people will walk around the mall . 
and it's safe . 
that's , uh , you know , inside the mall 
may be not safe going to the parking garage .
certain parts of it . 
i know a doctor once told me it , 
a friend of mine , uh , suggested swimming 
i used to do a lot of swimming , 
we have a swimming pool , 
but it's an old concrete pool . 
we've been having trouble with it the past few years , 
so we haven't got to use it much , 
but i love to swim and water ski and stuff like that . 
the , uh , swimming , they say , uses more muscles than any other exercise with , 
and the water takes the resistance . 
and you don't get the soreness . 
i've done some water exercises , 
but our pool is not heated 
so it's , 
you can't do it year round . 
summertime only . 
that's the way ours is . 
you don't go out when it's twenty some odd degrees ,
oh , no , 
it's too cold . 
hot tubs are uh , not too bad , 
i could deal with a hot tub . 
those are nice . 
so , what part of mississippi are you from ? 
i'm from laurel . 
whereabouts is that ? 
that's way down towards the south . 
not quite on the coast , 
but we're about two hours from the coast . 
and you do have cold weather down there ? 
yes , ma'am , 
it started raining and got real cold . 
ours started thanksgiving . 
and , uh , from there just , well , 
today was pretty , 
but , uh , oh , sunday the snow and ice came in . 
and , uh , there was no exercise . 
 how much of a golfer are you ? 
are you a hacker ? 
i'm fifty years old , 
i've been a hacker , 
i think i played better golf when i was fifteen , john , than 
i know i , 
i know i did . 
and , uh , 
course , i know i watch my thirteen year old play now , you know , 
and it's like they don't have a muscle in their body . 
oh , i know , 
it's just unreal . 
you know , i'm a guy that plays , 
if i play a lot of golf , i play six to eight times a year 
and that's about it . 
i figure that's my retirement game . 
i really , 
i come from a family of golfers . 
i mean , i was raised by a man , my stepfather who , with a two handicap , i mean , he could get down on his knees and hit the ball , i mean , further than most people could hit it . 
my stepfather is dead , but my mother who is now seventyone  , i can remember her being , i believe a sixteen or a fourteen handicap , 
but , uh , all they did every day in their life was to play golf every , 
they'd leave work and go to a golf course , or a little country club they belonged to back in richmond , virginia and just , uh , play nine holes of golf . 
that was their deal , 
that's what it takes , 
you need to play that often 
but , uh 
i have a brotherinlaw who is , uh , an excollege coach and like a pro 
and he has a very good handicap and plays good golf 
sort of like the non golfer golfer of the family . 
well , i went to , 
i decided this past year that i was going to get out and start playing a lot more 
and i went after it 
and and i really didn't find much improvement . 
oh , really ? 
i probably need to take some more lessons , uh , more current 
spend more time on the , 
i think i'm probably the same way . 
lessons do help . 
i know ever year we buy , 
i go to this ducks unlimited dinner , 
it's a hunter's type affair 
 and i buy in austin , texas , 
i go down to austin , 
i live in the dallas area , but i go down to austin and go with my good customer and friend of mine 
 and we always buy this weekend at a country club in the hill country .
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah , 
i'm familiar with it . 
and we just have a ball , 
and we play three days in a row , three different courses 
and , course , believe it or not by the end of the third day and the end of the , uh , third course , my score has gone from , you know , a hundred and twenty down to about a hundred and five . 
oh , yeah , 
if you play regular , i think it makes a big difference . 
you bet , 
so that makes a lot of difference to me . 
i try to work out regularly 
and when i am doing that , uh , and feeling loose that i swing better , 
i get through the ball better . 
uh , and i also , if i , 
i found as i've gotten a little older here , i worry less about my distance . 
you bet . 
and i , 
my control is a little bit better there . 
uh , so , 
that's super . 
i haven't learned to hit the ball easy 
and i just sort of , 
i'm always wanting to hit it hard 
and , that's something my stepfather never could teach me , you know , just to relax and hit the ball , 
and , you know , so , subsequently when i do tire out from playing like twelve , fourteen holes , you know , a lot of my energy's gone , 
when i do swing it's an easier swing 
 and i do , actually , hit the ball better . 
have you ever tried a one iron ? 
i hit a two iron awful lot . 
the tee . 
i don't hit a driver off the tee . 
that's why i need my driving lessons . 
well , you know , i put mine back in my bag this year , too , 
and i used a three wood rather than a driver . 
that helps . 
uh , i had a lot more control on it , uh , 
i sacrificed distance , 
but i wasn't in trouble every time i got down the fairway . 
well , that's a good idea . 
i think this next year , i'm going to attempt to play more 
and i'm going to do the same thing . 
i laid off my woods about three years ago 
and i just use a two wood off the fairway 
and i'm a fairly strong person 
so i get a pretty good little drive 
 and and i guess control my irons , better , you know , 
if you'll take lessons , the first thing they put in your hand is an iron . 
oh , yeah , 
and , uh , i still remember that watching myself and my son 
you need to play more often than i play . 
well , if you're scoring well , you should play more . 
if you're scoring poorly , you should spend more time on the practice g , 
uh , i think there is less frustration factor there , too , uh , 
makes good sense . 
the one iron is something i've been thinking because my driver's gone so badly lately that i should pick one up and try to start . 
apparently they're very difficult to play with , 
but with practice , i would imagine you could groove that swing , too . 
and i play with a fellow that can knock a one iron , 
it's incredible . 
oh , yeah . 
 and his accuracy is what's so startling with it . 
and i , 
but it's an iron that he's really practiced with . 
he has used a lot , 
and , uh , it would be fun to get that good at a 
you bet . 
my challenge of the game is just , if i can get off the first tee when everyone's standing around watching you , i'd be  ,
that , boy , 
i just , 
if i get off the tee box and i've , you know , you know , anything from a hundred fifty to two hundred yard drive through a straight , i just want to get down and kiss the ground , you know .
and get away without embarrassing yourself , 
well , do you exercise regularly ? 
there is , 
well , i am a school teacher . 
and , us , 
there is , uh , uh , girl that went through our school district , i teach in highland park 
 turn that off please , 
i am recording . 
any way , uh , she comes to the school 
and there are a group of teachers , 
and we exercise 
and we do it twice a week . 
oh . that is good . 
and , uh , we do , uh , aerobics , for our cardiovascular fitness for thirty minutes 
and then we do stretching 
so it is an hour . 
and then my husband and i take , uh , ten mile walks , uh , as often as possible . 
and , uh , not on the nights that i do aerobics , 
but if he wants to , he jogs , 
but we take the fast walks 
and we walk a couple of miles and then come back to the house . 
and so , we , take it seriously . 
we enjoy doing it . 
i enjoy my group at school . 
it is a lot more fun to exercise with somebody 
uh , well i use to exercise regularly 
and i haven't lately .
oh , oh .
i have goofed off , i guess . 
uh , i use to also take an aerobics class about three days a week before work . 
but , uh , i guess my job change , my husband's job change and it is just not easy to get up early in the morning any more . 
oh i understand that . 
so , uh , 
i have never been able to do it before . 
 well , the problem is that i am so tired at the end of the day , 
i just want to go home and not do anything . 
well , and too . i just make myself . 
i get up at five thirty 
and i am at school at seven thirty . 
school is not over until , uh , four 
 and our class , 
but it is in the building 
that is the big difference 
because there are other people around that , uh , 
you had better hurry . 
go get dressed . 
you know , there is motivation around there 
and then , uh , we can change right there in the building . 
i don't have to drive and fight traffic and get anywhere . 
and i just go 
and we , uh , exercise . 
and until then , you know i have belonged to exercise clubs 
and oh i have gone to , uh , oh , like , uh , oh , these gyms , you know uh , rec centers really 
and i have done that before , but it has always had to be late at night 
and you are just kind of going ugh . 
and i have tried it immediately after school 
like , try to get some place and exercise from five to six , 
but then by the time you get home and you get dinner you are eating so late . 
that is right . 
that is a   .
it is . 
it is really hard with our life style when you work to , 
well , i know , some people go during lunch , 
but , you know by the time i get over the gym and go for my class and shower and get back to work , it is probably two hours or more 
 and that is just too long . 
i have twentyfive minutes for lunch . 
that is out for me . 
that doesn't really do it , does it ? 
i don't think so . 
 uh , and they are nice because if we are running late , it usually , uh , 
if things are kind of hectic at school and people are running late , they kind of wait on us . 
you know , cause they know we are in the building and coming .
and , uh , it does going to start whether you are there or not .
that is right .
so this has worked out real nicely . 
in fact , she charges us two dollars a session . 
well , that is not much . 
so it's , 
we like pay her for six weeks at a time 
and so it is like twentyfour dollars every six weeks . 
that is not bad . 
it beats memberships at some of these clubs . 
that is for sure . 
you are not kidding . 
they are real expensive . 
i know . 
we belonged , uh , for a period of time to the signature club for about a year . 
i mean , we were paying a hundred dollars plus month for our family membership 
 and at first we used it 
and then it got where we weren't beginning to get out money's worth . 
and they offered lots of things , 
but we weren't taking advantage of them because we didn't have the time to . 
so we decided to forget that . 
that was just a waste of our our money . 
well we have one through work 
oh no . 
but , uh , i don't know 
i still just don't end up going cause it isn't at a convenient time or i don't know something , 
but i need to do something . 
if its only walk the dog or something . 
i need to start doing that . 
it does make you feel better . 
the hard thing is getting going . 
that is right . 
and if you have somebody who will do it with you , 
like , for a long time my husband didn't want to walk cause he wants to , uh , jog 
 but he decided that , uh , maybe , uh , you know , 
what are you guys having for christmas ? 
what are we having ? 
let's see .
well , i'm not planning the menu . 
oh , you're not . 
we usually go out to either one of our folks , 
they both live close to 
 but , um , i don't know , 
it seems like a big thing for christmas is usually ham . 
well , funny you should mention that . 
i'm a pig farmer .
oh , you are 
well , now , it's kind of a hobby more than anything else , 
but we're going to have , uh , wild boar 
my goodness . 
 uh , we killed a boar the other day , 
it was , you know , mating with the sows , 
and you can't use the piglets , you know , 
it's about six months of no use , 
so , uh , we shot him and cleaned him out and had him , you know , processed into ham , 
and , uh , we're also going to have a little roast suckling pig , because a hernia 
oh , really . 
 and rather than , you know , pay the vet four hundred dollars for surgery , we'll just cook him and eat him .
is that hard ? 
well , no , 
i'm telling you , real easy , easier than chicken . 
oh , really . 
you just , uh , 
you kill him , you know , 
you probably , 
most guys just shoot them in the head , 
they go , you know , 
in a second they're gone 
oh , my goodness . 
and after about six hours , you put the fire out and dig that baby out of there , 
and it's the best eating you ever had . 
oh , well , does a boar taste just like regular ham ? 
does it . 
 i mean , you know , uh , it has a lot less fat . 
this wild boar weighed probably about three hundred and thirty pounds 
oh my . 
 and he dressed out to almost two hundred and ten pounds . 
oh , my goodness . 
well , you know , we took the skin and the head and the feet off , 
and that was about , you know , a hundred pounds of just ham . 
oh , well , how many people are you planning on serving at christmas ? 
oh , well , you know , we're not going to eat the whole thing .
eat it all , 
it would take a year . 
but , uh , you know , we're going to drive up to kansas city , see my wife's folks , 
and , uh , she , 
what's your mother cooking for christmas  , 
well her mom's doing brisket . 
i don't , 
what is brisket ? 
it's a part of the cow that they used to throw away . 
it's just tough as a boot 
 and , uh , you know , they used to use it for leather , i think .
 oh , my goodness . 
 i mean , no , 
i was kidding . 
but , uh , it's a part of the loin , you know , the rib cage , 
and it has a lot of muscle in it and a lot of ,
so it's really a tough piece of meat 
oh , my goodness . 
 but it's so tasty , you can't stand it . 
so you just take it 
and you marinate it for a couple of days 
and that softens it up , huh . 
and then , uh , you just put it in the oven , 
takes about four hours to cook one . 
they weigh about anywhere from ten to twenty pounds . 
oh , gee . 
and , uh , we're going to have that . 
well , what else do you serve with your pig ? 
oh , well , we'll have cranberries and hominy 
and , uh , we're big on olives and cucumbers and stuff up here . 
we have black olives and cucumbers and , uh , tomatoes , 
we still have tomatoes 
oh , do you ? 
oh , we just got lots of snow .
 well , it started to freeze up around here , you know , 
there's nothing between you and us but our barb wire , and half of that's down . 
i mean it's thirty degrees this morning . 
oh , really . 
 but , uh , it'll go up to fifty or sixty almost . 
oh , my goodness . 
i didn't know it got that low at night . 
oh , yeah . 
well , it's desert , you know , 
it's , uh , the edge of the desert , 
i mean , it's part of the great plains . 
so in the day time in the summer it goes up to a hundred , hundred and ten 
oh , gee . 
 and at night it goes down to about sixty . 
my goodness . 
we get a fifty degree temperature swing in about four hours . 
oh , boy . 
so everything that lives around here is real tough .
that's trees , you know , 
we got hundred year old trees that are , you know , twenty feet tall . 
oh , gee . 
that's all the bigger they get , 
you know , they're just hard as a rock . 
how do you get your main source of current events ? 
well , uh , until recently i was taking the wall street journal , 
and i thought that was a good way , 
but i have about five different magazines that i get that keeps me up on things . 
you know , it's a week or two late , 
but , uh , that's how i'm staying up . 
i either watch the news 
or occasionally i'll read the paper . 
uh , do you like how it's presented on the news ? 
um , no , 
they allow you , uh , 
they try to lead you too much , i believe , 
and sometimes they're not very open , 
i don't know , 
i think they're a little bit biased sometimes . 
like for example , the kennedy rape case . 
the coverage on that was , you know , 
when it first happened it was , he was guilty , he was guilty , he was guilty . 
you know , they try to have you form opinions or whatever , 
and then the things that were going on when we had desert storm and stuff like that . 
you know , basically of everything . 
so , it makes you feel like they're , uh , wanting you to take their opinion . 
it's more like an editorial , i believe 
i've noticed that too , 
and you know , by just a couple of words . 
well , um , i was a communications major , 
so and so forth .
so , communications , huh . 
were you looking into becoming a reporter 
and , um , field . 
i went with the state . 
and , uh , i , um , went with the department of state treasurer in retirement disability , 
calculate benefits . 
i bet that's a interesting job . 
so the , 
you know , working for state government you hear all about current events , about things going on within the state itself . 
so where i keep up with current events 
there's one that i'm reading right now . 
it's information week . 
it says a t and t to account for the benefits that the a i c p a now says you have to show as a liability . 
it's going to cost them seven point five billion after tax charge in ninetythree ,
it's a lot of money . 
and it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more . 
it's a lot of money . 
and , yeah , you have to stay up on stuff , 
and i bet in your job that you have to , 
do you read the wall street journal ? 
well , no , 
but like the state of north carolina's budget , and stuff like that . 
and i really know what the budget is , 
and , uh , uh , when they were saying we were so poor and they couldn't pay taxes , and pay people their income tax refunds and things like that , 
and , you know , i'm well aware of the billions of assets that the state has , 
and it's just funny . 
you know , so that's , 
so i don't have a whole lot of faith in , you know , the news . 
course it's , 
they get what they hear from , 
but , you know , it's not always i think one hundred percent reliable . 
can you think of anything that could be done to make our news media more accurate and objective ? 
i think they need to go into a little bit more depth , uh , before they would just report , like somebody wants to make a statement or something like that , 
because i mean , another example is the , uh , aids issue or whatever . 
you know , someone said , oh , i found a cure . 
they immediately , 
the headlines on the news or whatever is , someone says they found a cure for aids . 
and then two months later it's discovered it's not , you know , 
to research the matter , i believe , a little bit more . 
i guess they do that so they don't get scooped , you know , 
so they have the big story . 
well , that , 
well , yeah 
i think the , 
let's see , *[[something missing ? a .1 ?
my husband does the majority of um , the , uh , gardening , uh , taking care of the lawn and fertilizing , 
but , i , um , tend to all the , planting the annuals and the spraying 
i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas , 
but basically he does all the heavy stuff , 
and i do all the fun stuff .
 well , we have it just opposite here . 
my wife works at the t i , 
and she's , uh , sedentary all day long 
i see . 
and we have about ten acres , 
and she tries 
wow . that's a big job . 
well , yeah , 
it keeps , uh , well , 
it's doing real well , 
because when we got this place the dirt was just overgrazed 
 i mean , you know , it was bare dirt in a lot of places 
 and now , you know , since we've been mowing it , 
and , you know , of course we water a little bit , 
that's just too much to water all at once , 
oh , sure . 
oh , i bet it's beautiful . 
but we don't do much in the way of , uh , flowers . 
we have one little flower garden 
the rest of it is just like wild flowers 
wild flowers . 
 and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers . 
they're about , oh , i guess , a third the size of palm of your hand 
oh , that sounds lovely . 
oh , the wild flowers are beautiful . 
just way in the back , behind the swing sets 
or , just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty . 
then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved . 
well , my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing . 
uh , she enjoys mowing . 
i can't believe it . 
i know a lot of 
 i mean , i hate it .
a lot of women do . um , 
i've just never really , you know , 
maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow , 
but , um , my husband takes it on , 
and i'll help rake up the grass , 
and , um , sometimes i'll help him edge , um , 
because , we don't have that much property , 
but we're on a corner lot , 
so there's a lot of edging to do 
 and , um , uh , that's what's nice about living more in the country , 
you don't have to worry about any of that .
we don't even have any concrete 
oh , that's nice , 
this is different for us because the other , 
in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks , 
and , um , it's been a little more country with the trees , 
and we do miss that . 
um , if we had a chance to move , i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified 
 but , you know , we do everything together . 
this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the , 
actually this fall , i was talking about , 
two weeks ago 
 and , uh , we're in the process of planting 
wow that's , 
 and we're building a stand , uh , just to the north of our house , and along the east , uh , property line 
 and what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break 
 well , i put , 
on the other side of the house , though , that's where we have all the delicate flowers and the mums , 
and we have morning glory 
 and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers , 
and we planted those out by the septic , so that , uh , they get plenty of water 
 and we get hummingbirds come in the 
oh , that sounds so pretty . 
and , well , when we leave the doors open , they fly in the house . 
oh really .
they , don't do any damage , though , 
they just fly right back out , if you have the , 
well , yeah , 
i see . 
 and when you're as busy as one of those babies , you've got to eat most of the time . 
i see . 
and we got a few , you know , 
we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders . 
but , you know , for the most part , gardening for us is , 
well , we got asparagus , 
and , uh , we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato 
man , we get the best strawberries , that you just can't believe . 
oh , oh , that sounds wonderful . 
we just got our last tomatoes . 
oh , i love home grown tomatos . 
there's nothing like them . 
they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket .
well , these are accidental tomatos . 
what does that mean , accidental tomatoes ? 
well , last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes , 
of course you're going to lose some that way 
 and the seeds go right through them . 
i see . 
and wherever they pooped , 
what are your favorite shows ? 
well , it's doesn't seem like i get enough time to watch much t v , 
i've watched that sisters a couple of times . 
i think that's kind of a good show . 
i've never seen that . 
haven't you ? 
oh . i like that one , 
and , um ,   i'm trying to think . 
i don't even know if i have any other real regular ones that i watch . 
how about you ? 
um , i like l a law 
oh , uhhuh , 
i do like that . 
occasionally i'll see that one . 
let's see . 
i watch cheers sometimes .
do you ? 
actually when there isn't a good movie on , too . 
i just like to have the t v on you know , if i'm home alone or something 
oh , uhhuh . 
either the radio or the t v s got to be on  ,
uh , oh , i do , 
i kind of have gotten into a couple of soaps lately . 
oh , really . 
well , i've been home with a , um , 
i have a baby , 
do you watch any of those ? 
but , um , i pro , 
i usually do if i'm home for a couple of days , like , you know , around christmas or whatever , 
after a while i'll start watching it 
 and then on , 
for a while i'll ask people if they know what happened 
 and then i'll just forget it . 
what ones do you get into ? 
uh , i don't even remember 
the last time i watched was back in college . 
it was like general hospital or something 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and i maybe watched it for a week 
 but , um , i know that people used to arrange their whole schedules around the , you know , 
they wouldn't take a class that was in the middle of their soap opera . 
how funny , 
oh , yeah . 
it was a , 
oh , i don't get into them that much . 
when i'm home , sometimes in the day i'll 
 but , yeah , oh , i was really trying to think . 
i don't even know if there's any other shows that i watch or else . 
well , you said you have kids . 
how old ? 
oh , i have a six year old , 
and i have a , um , 
he'll be a year old in january . 
so , you aren't a sesame street fan ? 
my six year old's kind of , 
he's outgrown that one a little bit , 
and he's entertained by it . 
so , yes , 
supposed to be a great babysitter .
i do turn that on . 
and i do like , um , donahue . 
sometimes i watch that . 
i think he has some interesting things on it . 
i know , 
i never see it ? 
um , let's see , it's on at four . 
oh , okay . 
i'm not home then , 
that's why i don't see it . 
i'll watch that occasionally . 
he's got some real , 
there's some real weird people that ,
isn't it strange how people are fascinated by other people that they think are strange  ? 
oh , yeah . 
  . e does have some real bizarre things , i think . 
so , other than that , i don't know . 
what's that ? 
guess i'm not much of a t v person really . 
but . ell , tell me , 
is it snowing up there ? 
um , no . 
no . 
it snowed a little bit , um , probably about four days ago 
 and they said we weren't going to get any more for christmas . 
well , that's nice . 
i wish it would snow a little bit more . 
i've heard it's raining there . 
we've broken all sorts of records . 
oh really . 
they've got , 
i mean , we still have some highways closed , 
and it stopped raining almost twentyfour hours ago . 
oh , my goodness . 
but , um , oh , just phenomenal , 
i mean , i , you know , 
you see it on the news all the time , 
but until you've really seen it , it doesn't really hit you . 
but i was driving home from work friday , 
and i saw , there were some stop signs , i mean , submerged up to the writing on the stop sign , 
and that was just 
oh , goodness . 
it was amazing to me . 
oh , gee 
so there has been some flooding 
oh , there's been a lot , 
it's too bad 
but you know , the thing is that this happens , 
in the last three years it's happened at least once a year , if not twice .
oh , gee . 
so , i don't know . 
i mean , you got to wonder how long they're going to keep doing that for . 
i don't think i would . 
oh , boy . 
because they just finished cleaning up from the last flood . 
oh , what a mess . 
well , now , do you work for t i ? 
  oh , uhhuh . 
have you made a lot of calls 
my husband is doing it too , 
and he's 
 but it's been real interesting and kind of fun . 
do you get paid for these ? 
um , five dollars . 
five dollars a call ? 
i wish i could do that .
uh , don't you have to do it as part of its , 
we can't get paid for it . 
don't you have to do it , 
what vacations have you been on that you like ? 
um , well i really enjoyed , um , 
i went to mackinaw island 
it's in the middle of michigan 
i like , um , driving to different cities because of the scenery , 
so that was nice . 
so you , 
most of yours is kind of driving 
i've been all over the states except for pretty much east . 
um , it's very pretty driving like , um , up north in wisconsin too . 
um , the furthest i drove was probably texas , 
and then i've taken a train before to california . 
now you're from where ? *[[slash error
kenosha , wisconsin . 
i have a brother in minnesota that used to live in wisconsin . 
so , yeah , 
that's quite a ways . 
it is .
i've , uh , 
we went to california this last year 
but it was too crowded 
walt disney world , and other places , it's just the wrong time of the year to go . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , course , uh , you get in any of those tourist traps 
and , uh , kind of , 
you wonder if it's really worth it to pay , uh , thirtyfive dollars or forty dollars just to get in . 
that's true . 
i think the scenery kind of , 
that's something do to , like to get up in mountains *[[two utts
oh , yeah , 
do you have any mountains nearby ? 
um , i think , uh , the biggest limitation is a lot , just time and money , isn't it . 
oh , yeah . 
what vacation have you enjoyed the most ? 
uh , um . probably , uh , when we go to wisconsin   .
um , it's pretty fun . 
there's a lot to do up there . 
it's pretty busy , though , 
you have to like crowds , you know . 
what is it ? 
um , oh , it's like a huge amusement park 
 and it's just a big , big tourist attraction . 
the downtown is all like little shops and candy shops 
and , it's really neat . 
i don't think , uh , hardly anybody lives there , 
because it's just kind of like , you know , tourists . 
summer place . 
how far away is it ? 
um , from kenosha , it's about three hours . 
it's about a hour away from madison . 
it's a pretty ride up there , too . 
i really like the city wausau in wisconsin . 
it's really pretty . 
it's nice out there . 
oh , i like all the nature things there are to look at , you know . 
well , and you can probably , 
you're in a climate that's kind of humid , 
so you have probably a lot of green , and lot of real pretty things . 
our climate's real dry 
where is that ? 
 and you have to kind of get up into the mountains to get much of the greenery . 
most of the land's pretty brown . 
you don't have as much of the greenery like you have . 
where's that ? 
uh , idaho , is where i live , 
and , uh  , 
it's by , uh , 
i have a little baby thinks he needs to cry now that i'm on the phone . 
 it's by , um , boise . 
you ever heard of boise ? 
oh , yeah , 
and , uh , it's fine , 
it's nice . 
it's , uh , lot different kind of . 
i lived in indiana for a while , 
and it's a real different , uh , land and scenery than there . 
it's kind of fun to have a little bit diversity , and 
i think , uh , there's a lot of places uh , oh , down , even in southern utah , the canyon lands and bryce canyon 
and , oh , boy , they're gorgeous 
those are kind of fun places . 
we usually go over to bear lake in the summer , which is kind of on the border of idaho and utah , 
and the lake goes on forever , 
and that's real pretty over there too . 
but i think i'm kind of a summer vacationer . 
oh , yeah , 
me too , uh , 
unless i'm going somewhere warm 
that'd be nice . 
where'd you , 
uh , are you presently looking , uh , for a used car ? 
just bought one . 
just within the last three weeks . 
what did you get ? 
i got a lexus l s four hundred .
lexus . 
lexus is a toyota subbrand . 
it's kind of their , 
i was wondering where that came from 
because they're talking like it was an american built car . 
it sounds like it , but it really isn't .
it's , uh , marketed , of course , its own dealerships . 
usually , or somebody that's maybe got a cadillac or lincoln and lexus dealership , uh 
sometimes they do that , 
but i've really liked it . 
it drives just wonderfully 
and there is , 
it's so quiet , almost can't tell the engine is running . 
that's their big selling point , uh , other than general luxury 
 uh , the quiet ride . 
it really is . 
it's got pretty good acceleration , too . 
it's got a c d player in it , 
so i can play those 
uh , was , 
there is only about five or six options . 
everything else is standard . 
you get the impression that , 
 uh , some of the tracking control things and skidding control things for up north .
skidding control , 
you mean the antilock brake system ? 
it's not just antilock brake . 
i think that's already on most of them , 
this is uh , 
 and also the suspension can be raised for driving , like in the ice and snow . 
it can raise the car's center up a little bit .
mississippi probably doesn't , 
some of these muddy driveways could use it around here . 
snow doesn't happen very often . 
uh , originally i'm from west virginia . 
we got a 
 well , you had some there . 
but , uh , i got down here in june of eightyfour , 
and the first winter down here was probably the worst winter they'd seen in twenty years , 
and it was amazing how a few inches of snow would turn normally sane , manly , adult men into playful little children . 
oh , i know . 
we had this group of , uh , surveyors come into , uh , a shop i was working in , uh , four or five of them , these big old flame worn suburbans and the snow all over the place . 
they had just come in to get gas in their vehicles and get the oil checked . 
but , while they were there they set back  , drank about four or five cups of coffee apiece and made snowmen on the hoods of their vehicles 
oh , no . 
well , uh , the lexus , uh , really , 
and the moon roof i think is also an option . 
although most of them are ordered them with it , 
but there really is only about a half a dozen , uh , things 
i did not get the traction control which also , when you take the  , and the suspension thing it also puts heaters in the front seats , too . 
so that's kind of , 
you go out and get in that real cold car 
it's a package deal . 
 and you turn that on , 
 yeah , and it kind of , uh , 
but that's only available with the traction control and the other option . 
and those two are sold together 
so you have to take a two thousand dollar option there to 
so i opted not for that 
it doesn't sound real necessary in texas . 
i worked for lincoln , 
 so the only thing i had to decide on was whether i wanted a c d or not in the stereo system 
and that was pretty much it . 
and they had like three or four basic packages that they 
sounds like the lincoln mercury dealer i used to work for . 
they didn't order anything but the extra luxury version of whatever they got . 
little mercury tracer 
i've been o , 
i've been , 
imagine , or not , they make a luxury mercury tracer . 
i've seen that in the dealership . 
i was driving a lincoln , a mark seven 
and , uh , i'm leasing the lexus . 
i usually lease them 
i just run it through my business , 
it's just , 
it really is , 
and it's got a lumbar support in the seats . 
and just kind of brings that support up in the sma , 
tell me what you think about the vietnam war . 
well , i'm a vietnam era veteran , 
and , uh , i was , uh , fortunate not to have to serve in the theater , 
however , my support roll in the service was to support those in the theater of operation . uh , 
i'm of the old school that believes that , uh , the , uh , uh , contracts that we made back years ago needed to be honored . 
however , uh , i think we could have executed the war and gotten it over a whole lot quicker . uh , 
but those are my personal thoughts , 
and i think that if we'd let the generals run the war like we let the generals run world war two we'd had got it over a whole lot quicker and lost a lot fewer people . 
but as it was , the politicians ran the korean conflict and ultimately the vietnam thing , 
and we managed to come out , uh , losers all the way around . 
and so this is what uh , deciding to get out of the role of world policeman . 
your views , 
uh , as i understand it , and i , uh , france 
 uh , france was there first . 
they had , 
we got into it because of seato agreement , back just right after world war two that , uh , we pledged a mutual , uh , uh , defense of the south vietnamese , 
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another , 
and really we 
i question us , you know , now , 
of course hindsight is all too clear . 
uh , so , as we played it . 
jerry , what did you think of people like , uh , jane fonda , another antiwar activist . 
don't get me started on those people . 
you know , did what she did , i thought she was a wonderful person , 
but after , uh , uh , well , 
want anything to do with her any more , 
because uh , you support your government . 
right or wrong ? 
i don't think we can determine whether we were right or wrong , 
because , you're having to deal with , again , uh , 
i think we could have made a different agreement 
uh , you know , i didn't realize that we'd signed some type of deal like that . 
i thought we came in as first advisors to the french , and then they decided to pull out 
can you hold just a second , terry ? 
one moment please . 
wonder what happens to this little beastie on call waiting or something . 
huh , fascinating . 
well that's not , 
sorry for the delay . 
that's okay . 
uh , yeah , 
this is , 
the , uh , mutual defense thing was , uh , 
it was complicated , 
and i don't think everybody knows the whole situation . 
i don't . 
well , the french went in and tried their old style warfare , and , uh , got soundly thrashed . 
and we didn't do a whole lot better . 
um . no , 
had thought that they had , uh , colonies there , or something . 
well , yeah , 
 and they're also our allies in seato , which was the southeast asia treaty organization , which has since been , uh , disbanded as far as i know , 
you know , nato is on the way of being disbanded . uh , 
but , uh , you know , the french , yeah 
 so , uh , you know , full scale troops , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera . 
i'm thirtytwo , 
so , uh , i bar , 
well , i missed it . 
seventyfour is when they quit sending troops . 
uh , yeah , 
i was just probably three or four years , 
what kind of hobbies do you have lori ? 
uh , i guess , uh , i like to play golf . 
and , uh , i also like to plant flowers and do some gardening and do arts and crafts . 
where do you play golf in this area ? 
well , we live , uh , pretty close ,
so , we will play either out there or at firewheel . 
that is usually where we play , 
but i have played you know different courses in in the dallas area . 
uh , both .
not at the same time . 
 no , sometimes we ride 
and sometimes , uh , we , pull , 
we like to , to , uh , a lot of the times just walk , uh , for the exercise . 
i find that when i ride in a cart , i play better 
and i think it is cause i don't get as tired .
i think that might be true . 
i don't like pulling a cart on firewell golf course because they want you to pull the cart on the path . 
i know , 
and that makes me so mad .
you know , like it is not going to do that much damage to the course , but apparently they think differently .
that is the reason , i don't play over there . 
i like the course , but i don't play over there because , they don't , uh , you know don't allow you to pull a cart . 
and , i don't think a cart damages the turf . 
well , the reason why we play over there is because its where , since we are a garland resident , they gave us a special deal where you can get , uh , ten rounds of golf for a hundred dollars , 
a hundred dollars 
cause it is half price what the normal green fees are . 
so that is you know play over there 
cause we have got our card .
well , i guess i could use a card too . 
i live , uh , uh , very close to the firewheel golf course . 
oh , do you ? 
so you live in garland then . 
right up there near the golf course . 
well we are in south garland , 
but yeah , next time you go , uh , you know , check into it , 
they have , uh , 
it is just like , uh , a bus card 
and they just punch it . you know , 
it has got one through ten on it 
and every time you go they just punch it for you . 
well , in the last two years , i have not played very much golf because i am involved in boy scouts . 
oh , okay . 
so , uh , i have children 
you must have a son . 
and , uh , so 
oh , okay . 
so i would have to say that camping and hiking and canoeing and boy scouts is my hobby . 
 but i 
 oh well that sounds like fun too .
 but my golf clubs will probably rust before i get to use them again 
because my boys are still right at the beginning age 
and it is probably going to be six to eight years before they go to college . 
well , you need to , uh , teach them how to play and take them out on the course with you .
that's right . 
lessons are expensive though . 
oh , yeah . 
well you can teach them .
well , they would probably never make it then 
because i don't think , uh , 
i only took lessons for golf when i was in college . 
uh , as a course for p e you know 
but , uh , that is the only time i think i have ever really taken golf lessons 
and that was kind of a group 
i took one lesson one other time . 
besides that , uh , i just , uh , try to make the club hit the ball . 
i know what you mean .
i don't want to play strike out , you know . 
but i have fun doing it , 
uh , you know , i have some good shots and some bad shots . 
oh yeah . 
it is just nice to get outdoors and do something . 
so you said you work , uh , in the gardens too . 
do you have , uh , special flowers ? 
 well flower gardens . 
i like to have , 
matter of fact this past weekend i just got finished planting a bunch of tulips and daffodil bulbs . 
so , those ought to be coming up around spring time .
my wife had , uh , just put in a bunch of , i want to say , they are pansies . 
she put them in like two months ago cause they are winter plants . 
and they have been , 
we thought even with all the cold weather weather we have had they have been blooming just fine . 
oh , they do great . 
i put mine in probably in november . 
that is when she did , i think . 
i think it was november 
and i don't do anything to mine , water them or anything .
and they just , 
they do really good 
and i even had , uh , i guess it was last year or the year before , i had some out 
and it froze 
and the pansies looked terrible , but they came back later . 
i didn't do anything to them 
so uh , they are good to plant in the winter time . 
they last for a long time then . 
so , if you start putting them , you know , you can put them out in the spring too , 
but once it starts getting real hot 
do they survive longer if you plant them in the winter time ? 
will they make it through the summer sun ? 
but they make it through probably winter and spring . 
i have got some of those too , 
cause i love flowers .
well , that is good . 
and i try to do some arts and crafts 
and i love to go , 
so you have a child 
and we went through the process of searching for child care and 
how about you , 
do you have any children ? 
and he just turned three months . 
oh , boy . 
so , we're care . 
right now , both of us are students . 
are you ? 
where are 
uh , university of southern mississippi . 
no kidding . 
uh , she's , 
i was a professor in a university here in california for a while . 
uh , are you going to , uh , put your son in child care in a year or two ? 
actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care uh , five days a week more than likely .
because my wife will be doing her internship that semester . 
it will be forty hour week , no , eight to five type of thing . 
 , depending on what my class schedule looks like , he may spend to eight hours a day in child care at that point . 
right now we're trying to avoid it , 
but we just , as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a girl to , uh , watch him . 
uh , i get out of class at certain time 
and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class . you know , 
once a day this overlap happens where we can't , one of us 
so for about twenty , thirty minutes a day we got a babysitter comes in . 
well , that's a good experience , i think , 
and , uh , there are a lot of things to think about 
and the articles that are written on the topic ,
and they kind of boil down to , uh , 
any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative 
 and what we found , uh , to be the best guide was our own instincts about ,
 and , uh , that's more important than anything else . 
we could have sent , uh , her to a fancier , uh , facility . 
uh , she goes to a home . 
this is uh , 
they've been here probably thirty , forty years . 
they've got three daughters . 
uh , and , 
and , uh , they're both there 
and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon . 
and our daughter is healthy , happy , well adjusted and enjoys going 
uh , that makes a big difference . 
i th , 
if it's good , 
i think it's very good for the child . 
and if it's ,
and , and that's really what we've learned about it . 
she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year 
 but , uh , we feel real fortunate 
and we were able to , uh , just , uh , choose in the marketplace . 
i don't know what it's like around , uh , hattiesburg . 
there's a lot of child care available , but 
and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list 
i'll bet they're involved . 
 uh , uh , they have a subbranch , uh , american family counseling 
and their people staff uh , the child care center just off campus . 
but , uh , they have a pretty good size waiting list . 
well , that's , uh , 
i know in , uh , university communities . 
out here at manford , they have a real good facility 
and there , uh , is quite a waiting list to get into that . 
so it's an important ,
it's an industry that's still a cottage industry 
 and i think this really 
a cottage industry's the best way to do it really , 
 because if you over , 
i think that , uh , my own interest human development 
because , i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market . 
as a matter of fact , my future is banked on that , uh , professionally because i believe that there are , uh , pressing needs in the marketplace , unmet by schools , colleges 
primary skills which turn out 
and it's amazing how much good things like , uh , sesame street will do . 
it's phenomenal . 
it's phenomenal , the human operating system , 
favorite type of music or musician or any . 
i don't really have a favorite type . 
i like , uh , a lot of different types of music . 
do you ? 
 but it's pretty varied . 
how about you ? 
oh , uh , i'm very varied as well . 
uh , i don't think i've ever met a type of music i don't like except for , uh , maybe , you know , heavy metal and that . 
that's exactly me . 
the acid rock or the heavy metal . 
even some of that i like okay 
i don't care for that at all . 
i don't enjoy rap too much , either . 
that doesn't appeal to , uh , my ears . 
 well , as far as the rap goes , i think there are a few artists that appeal to me 
 and i like some of their songs . 
but as 
i agree , with the general rule , i wouldn't choose rap either . 
but i like to listen to , uh , what you might call pop , easy listening 
i don't , 
i like , uh , like i said , pretty varied , uh , music . 
i have a couple that my husband really hates 
i really love to listen to her , 
 and , uh , i even have a tape of lady smith blackman bazo 
oh , gosh . 
 and , well , i mean , they're very harmonic 
they really are . 
so , they're interesting to listen to . 
you might try that . 
how about you ? 
well , um , i listen to , uh , specific , 
most likely i would be listen to , uh , jazz or classical music . 
um  , in college i took , uh , four years of classical guitar , 
and i played in the jazz combo all four years . 
i play guitar 
oh , yeah ? 
so , uh , that's where my two listening enjoyments are , 
but , you know , jazz can get on my nerves after a while . 
uh , you can't just listen to it , you know , uh , especially a lot of the deeper stuff , 
it's too , um , uh , 
you have to concentrate on it , it seems . 
it just doesn't do anything . 
what about the blues or something like that ? 
uh , uh , blues are okay . 
i tell you , i do like , um , 
i grew up on blue grass music . 
my dad is a big blue grass fan , 
and so 
 um , i wouldn't have admitted it when i was in high school 
i like some of it , um , 
um , some of it sounds more like pop music . 
uh  , they've all got , you know , the real screechy electric guitars now . 
oh , n , 
 or , uh , merle haggard 
that type of country western is 
 um , oh , i like sound tracks a lot . 
oh , do you ? 
you sure do . 
i mean , you know , think about like the twin peaks and stuff like that 
things like that i like to listen to . 
um , i like instrumental things . 
um , i have some spiro gyro tapes . 
oh , they're great aren't they . 
oh , they're wonderful . 
i love them . 
i have some dulcimer music . 
i mean , like i said , that's pretty varied . 
it sure is , 
al jarreau , he's somebody i like . 
i like his , 
he has a nice smooth voice . 
oh , yeah , 
and , you know , what i like the most about him , is , i've gone to see him in concert , and he looks like he's having fun . 
i mean , some people sing , 
and they have their faced all contorted ,
but he looks like he's having a good time . 
i mean , he's up there moving around and smiling like he's happy 
and he is real fun to listen to . 
um , bonnie rait , i like her a lot . 
um , in fact , whenever she won her big grammy 
i think it was like five of them or something 
but , um , i was listening to a particular radio station 
well , i vowed then that i was not going to listen to that radio station any more , if that d j can make such a unedu , 
well , mark , our situation is that we do have a daughter that is , uh , in the situation of choosing college . 
she's actually at bible college for this current year . 
and , uh , i guess  , uh , first and foremost , really it's a question of what the student wants to have in the way of a career and then , uh , uh , which colleges or universities can best offer that program , 
and then it comes down to the dollar . 
you have to , uh , 
it's whether or not you're a resident for that jurisdiction , 
it comes down to , uh 
 damn it   , i agree pretty much with everything you've said . 
uh , i think , you know , it's really important for them to actually visit the college and actually try and get away from , you know , the guided tour of the college and try and talk to the , you know , actual students there 
because , you know , they're just , uh , in my experience , 
i've talked to people at other colleges , uh , that , you know , 
catalogs isn't always the whole story . 
the college , 
the catalogs are sales material . 
it doesn't matter 
it , uh , really is helpful if a parent and the student can get there and see 
uh , i guess there's a difference in , 
here the , 
at least ,
like , they just live in the community . 
uh , you know , i know that there are a lot of colleges and universities , particularly as they get to be a little bit on the smaller side where dormitory life is , uh , is right on campus as well 
 and you know , that changes the character 
i go to georgia tech which is , you know , primarily an engineering school 
 and , uh , you know , i think i really do miss the fact , you know ,  that  it's not a university , that the , you know , 
it tends to be a very conservative school 
will have . 
uh , i guess we're here , 
uh , in competitions 
and that's the kind of thing that also uh , if you can see the kinds of achievements that have been made by students as well as graduates 
uh , a spirit of , somewhat unkind , but 
uh , you know , as sort of some development and some training , uh , 
like it's easy enough to crank out graduates , but to really challenge them 
 you know , what the attitude towards achievement is . 
uh , do you , uh , have anyone that you're seriously needing to , uh , feed information to ? 
i suppose if you're actually at georgia tech as a student , you're a ways away from that . 
uh , i don't really know of anyone with the exception of , uh , people's younger brothers and sisters . 
uh , but , uh , no , 
job when you graduate 
well , really , a valid point that people need 
uh , you know , to , 
going to university is going to take four to eight years depending on the 
and after that , you have to be out in the real world and have to be able to support yourself 
 and if you go in an area that there is just not much of a job market 
if that's , 
like a fine arts education , 
best training in the world is not going to put food on your table . 
but , uh , 
you have any pets ? 
and i have two dogs . 
two dogs , 
what kind ? 
i have a schnauzer 
and i have a sheltie . 
schnauzers . 
it's a miniature . 
oh , okay . 
well , the schnauzer i'm watching for one of , uh , the managers where i work 
and he's been transferred to germany for a while 
 and i'm taking care of his dog 
 uh , and i had just got the kitten when he asked me that 
and , you know , they just love kittens . 
they just are fascinated . 
oh , yeah . 
so she doesn't know that this is a cat yet . 
that's good . 
they  say   , 
and they get along real good . 
 so that was interesting . 
didn't expect that would happen . 
that's cool , 
that's nice . 
uh , let's see , 
what was the other dog you had ? 
it's a sheltie . 
oh , a sheltie . 
she's real sweet little dog . 
she's got a very nice temperament . 
uh , they're not as aggressive as a schnauzer . 
you know , the schnauzers are a little aggressive . 
they can be nippy . 
shelties are nice . 
everybody seems to be really happy with them . 
they're good temperament . 
they put up with a lot . 
 and they just , uh , 
i think they have a good head on their shoulders . 
i think they have a higher level of intelligence than other , uh , dogs that i have encountered . 
schnauzers , in particular probably . 
but also some poodles , uh 
oh , yeah . 
they're kind of , 
there are some smart ones out there , 
but there's also some , uh , not so smart ones .
i g , 
it seems the smaller the are , the worse off they are .
there's , uh , some credence in that statement . 
they're bred down so much . 
they aren't the best pets . 
i really don't know 
i guess it's up to the individual and how they relate to their animal . 
i mean , some people seem fairly well suited for 
but i don't know about pit bulls 
pit bull . 
they might , 
they're actually very friendly dogs . 
are they really ? 
i don't think i've ever 
 uh , they're really nice . 
i've dealt with quite a few of them . 
customers that bring them into the shop and ask me like , they , uh , fit collars and stuff on them 
and they are just really nice , really friendly , uh , kind of like medium intelligence . uh , 
well , how do they become s , 
how did they get their reputation , then ? 
well , because some people , uh , want to train them as , 
oh , they train them to be that way , then . 
oh , okay . 
you really can't get a pit bull from birth that's that way . 
oh , okay . 
it takes a lot of training and a lot of abuse to get a dog to really 
 oh , dear , 
so the 
oh , dear . 
they aren't by nature really nasty critters . 
they are very determined critters 
i was impressed by them . 
they're real sturdy little critters 
and they aren't that big .
 well , that's unusual . 
i was 
huh , well , i suppose you were surprised . 
right now , 
they have quite an , uh , uh , notable reputation as far as , you know , 
they picked up a lot of bad press lately . 
they're banned in some areas i understand . 
well , yeah . 
but , can be bad if you train it to be that way . 
you know , that , 
well , yeah , 
it's , when , 
in my hometown , they just outlawed ferrets 
oh , okay . 
oh , okay . 
i mean , these people had left this infant in the same room with this loose ferret . 
the ferret is used to running the house and was kind of wild 
 and , you know , they should expect something like that to happen . 
and so bas , 
now it's like ferrets are outlawed in the town . 
oh , did it attack the child , then ? 
and that was not a good thing , 
but i think it was probably it was a fairly wild ferret . 
well , the 
they hadn't , 
 i mean 
they didn't . 
it's too bad it happened , though . 
because then the animal's in trouble , and not the person . 
go ahead .
uh , no 
but , in my job , i'm a nurse , and we are allowed to be . 
i mean , you know , this is the rules that they can do this anytime . 
uh , i don't know of anyone who ever has been picked out and been tested . 
so it's just sort of , uh , 
they can if they , 
oh , okay . 
well  wai ,  have you had any experience with it at all ? 
but i've always worked on a university level 
but a lot of my friends had to be tested before they got summer jobs and stuff . 
so what do you think about that ? 
uh , i don't think they're very accurate 
because , i mean , i know their lifestyles changed prior to the drug test 
and i know they changed afterwards . 
see i know of that too . 
and i also know that things like antihistamines , sudafeds , things like that , can really throw it off . 
and you cannot get a job because of it 
i had a friend , 
it didn't cause her any problems with her job 
but it came back that she tested positive for using a hallucinogen . 
but what it was , was she had been , uh , in the jungle 
and it was some malaria medication 
and she tested positive for that . 
see , and so it really is a dangerous thing that way 
because i know of somebody that tested for an airline and didn't get the job 
and they weren't told why . 
but a lot of people say the reason why , after you take a physical , will be because of the drug testing 
or they would tell you . 
or this person never use any drugs . 
see , i always , 
i thought you got called back if you tested positive , for more tests . 
uh , you should . 
because you should be given another chance or at least be able to justify it or something . 
i have real mixed feelings about it . 
i don't know . 
do you know how wrong they are ? 
i mean , is there a margin of error ? 
the accuracy ? 
i don't know . 
but , i know there are a lot of things that can influence them 
and i think that a person deserves a second chance with it or something because most things will stay in your system for a long time . 
and if you could show that , 
i interviewed for a job recently 
and i was taking entex .
and it didn't come up that i needed to do it 
but this could happen to anybody 
and if they would just say oh , this person's drug test is positive we won't hire them 
 so i don't know . 
 and i'm not so sure they are that needed . 
i'm not 
the only way i can see it is that if they really suspect a person of using it , then they have the right to go ahead and prove it 
because they say they can spot check . 
if you're using it while at a job , i can see a problem . 
but the occasional person , then like , it's almost an infringement of your privacy . 
i'm not real sure how i feel about it because i can see it from two ways . 
you know , as a health professional , i wouldn't want somebody to take care of me that was using drugs . 
you know , so as a patient , i feel well , yeah , we probably should be protected . 
but , on the other hand , there's a lot of things i should be protected from that they don't test my patients for too . 
you can't go around testing everybody for everything . 
so , i don't know . 
and i think it could be used to hassle somebody . 
if someone was out to get you , i think that a company or a boss could use this . 
you know , they could keep on doing this to you or something , i guess . 
i can see where it could become a problem . 
and it seems like now they have tests 
i guess they can test your hair 
and they can find out if you use drugs 
i know . 
i mean a lot of people as kids or , you know , young people get into some things that they get out of later on 
and i don't think they should really have to pay for that forever . 
there's a lot of things you do as a kid that 
i think that's true . 
so that probably wouldn't be too good either . 
how many children do you have now ? 
well i have five . 
 well , i mean four of them are grown , 
they're in college or just out of college 
so i really have just a thirteen year old at home . 
you sound so young . 
well , i work at it .
to have them , uh , 
i try to fool everybody .
 i think you're doing a good job . 
i just have one child . 
and , uh , i don't think , uh , 
well there's not much i can do about it . 
in our forties , you know , 
so , uh 
 but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the pivot point of the universe . 
i think you are right 
because i was an only child too . 
and that's one reason i have so many because i enjoy the big family . 
and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters 
and so she is sort of like an only child 
and it's the same type of thing , uh , 
i have a younger brother like that . 
i'm in my forties , like i say 
and i have a brother in his twenties . 
and i was the youngest . 
so i understand how that worked . 
and he was treated like he had five fathers or something . 
that's exactly how it is , you know . 
she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her . 
when things don't go right , she just calls one of them , you know . 
but , uh , yeah , 
it's a little bit difficult , though . 
i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more . 
 did you all do a lot of organized things like , uh , little league , uh , soccer ? 
my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion . 
she twirls a baton 
and we did a lot of things together . 
she and i did a lot of things together and flew , 
we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform . 
and that was a lot of fun . 
but i guess you could consider that organized . 
i mean , there is a competition all the time . 
we were very heavy into that . 
other than that , they were pretty much , 
and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that . 
you know , i think that's probably true . the , 
if you have one child or fewer , you get involved in organized events or 
and if you have a large number of children then you don't . 
well , you can't afford to . 
you ca , 
and there's not enough time , uh 
 like my son is in , uh , little league this year . 
he's ten . 
and they practice three times a week 
and they have a game 
and it's just , uh , if there were more than one child , i don't know , there would be no way to do it . 
that's right . 
 you know , one parent go one direction 
and i'd have to go in the other 
well i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter 
and my little one also competed because really she had no choice . 
she had to go with me . 
so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and competing 
and , of course , the competing itself , really didn't matter what it was , 
it was making the friends and going all the places 
and it was a really neat experience , 
but it took our total time . 
i did not work , uh , when i did this . 
now i do work fulltime . 
and it's just ,
and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other . 
  so   , 
i don't think , although i , 
i think more than one child , probably three children is probably the ideal to me 
but i'm not sure i could afford three . 
i most certainly couldn't educate three . 
i don't know how my parents did it . 
i mean , there were five of us 
and i don't recall , you know , wanting anything in particular . 
uh , but i don't know how my father did it . 
he worked at a truck line 
and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children . 
but we did okay . 
we had a house and a home and , 
but now , my wife and i both work 
and i don't believe we have as much as my parents did 
and we only have one child . 
well , things cost a lot more . 
i don't know how it is in georgia 
 and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some . 
atlanta is horrible . 
is it ? 
and different areas 
and from talking to them , they're shocked . 
and they , you know , 
the housing is so cheap 
that's what i've heard . 
they sell their house , 
they stash away a good bit of money and come down here 
and i work with a lot of them , 
they have really done something . 
then when they get down here , they realize the cost of living is outrageous 
the housing is cheaper , 
but that's about it . 
i've heard very positive things about atlanta , 
  oh so   , 
i'm not as ashamed to claim them this year as i have been so .
 well , it , 
let's put it this way . 
we've got the new england patriots up here 
oh yeah . 
right . well , 
they've had some serious problems in the past couple of years . 
um , well , uh , partly due to ownership . 
you know , uh , victor kiam owned uh , the patriots 
and he always had being able to put his foot in his mouth every time he went to say something 
and , uh , they've had some financial problems with the team and so forth . 
and it recently was sold to , uh , some other people 
so , hopefully , this ownership can set up new direction and , uh , keep , uh , the patriots in the new england area anyways .
well it will be fun for you to watch up there anyway 
oh , yeah . 
i've been to a few games before . 
now you're from texas . 
so you've got two football teams down there . 
i live right by dallas 
 oh , i see . 
that's how it is . 
it's divided , 
it really is , 
so we've got our cowboys here 
 do you , 
and he is for the , uh , raiders . 
do you follow professional sports at all ? 
but i've been trying more this year . 
i think i know a little more than i use to . 
i never knew very much at all 
so i'm trying .
well , it's a good past time , you know . 
particularly football . 
they say , uh , the physical aggression on the field 
and supposedly , psychologists say uh , that , uh , men take out their frustrations by watching football 
and , you know , they get together with a bunch of guys 
uh , uh , and they have a good time and everything 
and that's suppose to be some of and the , uh , the male instincts , i guess , or something about the , uh , 
well , no . 
uh , of a contest . 
i think that , uh , 
i personally like hockey better because it's a contact sport . 
it has the speed . 
and the hand eye coordination 
and it takes a certain skill to play hockey . 
not everybody can play hockey . 
so we , 
we're a big hockey area up here , 
i bet up here in new england as well 
 really  .
i don't even think we have that in texas . 
what , hockey ? 
we might . 
do we ? 
you probably know , 
i don't know . 
there's no .
nobody talks about it 
so i don't think we do . 
there's no professional hockey teams in texas   .
 and we have a soccer team that comes and goes . 
we don't even have that very much , 
i think though that professional football 
like they have this world football league . 
you see , we have the n f l that dallas 
there are those teams that play in professional , national football league 
but , uh , now they have what's called the world football league 
and they have all these teams from , 
there's a team in london 
and there's a team 
and there's teams in the united states 
and they're playing now during the summer months 
and it's really .
 oh yeah . 
 and there's only so much football you can watch . 
well , i like to do , 
i don't like to watch . 
that's good . 
i don't like to watch anything . 
so it kind of annoys me when people just lay in front of a t v and watch all this stuff . 
i think it's an , 
and i can see what you're saying about the male bonding 
and the 
and that's kind of cool . 
that's fun , you know . 
but it can get really overdone . 
 now , have you ever been to a professional football game ? 
have you ? 
did you do the whole thing , the tailgate party and the whole , 
 uh , no 
 actually , no . 
 well see , now see that's what you got to do , see . 
now we talked our , 
i've done that for college football . 
you , the , 
well the same thing . 
we talked our wives , 
there's about six or eight guys that we use to go out for these games . 
and , uh , we talked our wives into going with us one time 
and they had a real good time 
and it was , basically , for the social atmosphere . 
and that's the thing , you know . 
you go , you know three or four hours before the game . 
you go set up . 
we set a table up , 
we do some cooking , some barbecueing , have a few drinks 
 but that whole , 
it's not so much , sure the contest itself and the game itself , 
that you miss sitting home in your parlor , you know , uh , with a six pack of beer and some , uh , potato chips , you know 
that's right . 
you miss that . 
that's right . 
and any professional sport i think ,
the atmosphere of being there , you know . 
 well , in high school i went to every football game 
 and you know , i didn't , 
i still don't know that much about football , obviously . 
but i still had a good time . you know , 
well foot , 
uh , do you have children in school ? 
uh , i have two that are , uh , now just about ready to graduate from college 
 but i also have two that are just entering school . 
a lot of testing ? 
uh , well it seems to me that kindergarten is now the equivalent of first grade . 
my son leaves the house at seven thirty and doesn't get home until three o'clock . 
and i think that's such a long day for a kindergartner . 
i do too , 
oh , i think that's awful . 
and , uh , i have a preschooler . 
uh , i was told by her preschool teacher that she thought maybe she was to immature for kindergarten 
i know . 
what's the new criteria , huh . 
and , uh , there is a , 
do you have the standardized testing now ? 
it's i t b s everything . 
and they test , test , test . 
i live in plano actually 
and i don't know if you've heard of plano 
a lot of people from everywhere , 
it's just north of dallas 
 and it's grown in leaps and bounds . 
we must have maybe a hundred and fifty thousand people now . 
and most of them from other places . 
uh , j c penney's come down from new york and , of course , t i and xerox from rochester 
and we just ,
and it's a very wealthy community . 
uh , not that i am 
but other people seem , 
and i would love to know why 
but i mean they do . 
they have , 
i would , 
i really would . 
 i mean , they just have beautiful , beautiful homes 
and they have everything . 
the kids only wear name brand things to school 
and it's one of these things , 
 oh me . 
oh , me . 
i mean , we do it to a point 
it's hard to explain to them why you can't . 
and so , uh , we just kind of have ,
and we have a very goal oriented population because their parents are . 
and so i don't know how much of it ,
but the kids are expected to excel in ,
oh , dear . 
and it's almost impossible because you have so many children and just so many activities that everybody can't be first 
 and they're 
you know , their parents expect it , 
the teachers expect it , 
texas wants very badly to be considered tops in the school system 
 and if you read national surveys , they're far from it . 
and so  there's  just a whole lot of testing and a whole lot of pushing to do well on these tests . 
how about the kids . 
how are they coping with it ? 
well , not very well . 
they bring home notes that say they have to get a good night's sleep 
i mean they make a big deal . 
to me , the paper should just be put on the desk that day 
you know , i just feel they do better that way . 
rather than 
and i have older children too that now are out of high school 
and they've always done this here . 
i mean it's always been the same 
but it's getting worse and worse , 
and i just think it's really awful 
and i'm with you on that . 
but i think it's a very long day . 
oh , it is . 
and my feeling is that , you know , you're only a kid once , and you don't want to 
that's right . 
my son came home 
we hardly ever play 
 and i don't think that's right . 
i think we should do what europe does and include cultural activities in our school system . 
oh , likewise . 
i would like to see those things included in our school system 
wouldn't that be great . 
and so i just find this a real problem . 
i think if they're going to be there all day , they should find time . 
one of my daughters , once , was out of school with mono in her junior year i think it was . 
and she had a home teacher for like four hours a week 
and when she went back in six weeks , she was ahead . 
 so what 
is that right ? 
it tells you there's a whole 
 oh , my gosh . 
oh , my gosh . 
and they could be using this time better . 
well , for example , in my son's kindergarten . they're really finished at lunch time . 
after lunch , they have some , uh , 
i'm trying to think if they have recess after lunch , 
and then they have naps or rest period . 
and , uh , i think either send them home or do something 
that's a very long day for kindergartners . 
i agree . 
but i think that working parents have kind of demanded this . 
i wouldn't be surprised . 
you know , because they don't want to send them to daycare . 
i doubt if they would say it was too long .
that's why they want them there because them somebody takes care of them all day .
uh , do you have the before school care ,
this is archie . 
hi , archie . 
i'm sharon . 
have you seen dancing with wolves ? 
uh , that was a really good movie . 
probably one of the best things about it was the scenery 
and , uh , i thought the story was pretty good , too . 
i think kevin costner did a really good job with it . 
have you ever lived in that part of the country ? 
have you ever visited it ? 
um , i've visited the wyoming area . 
i'm not sure exactly where dances with wolves was filmed . 
i think it was the black hills of south dakota . 
i haven't been to south dakota . 
have you been up to that ? 
well , i lived in omaha for five ,
and that rolling kind of , uh , 
is  fairly famili ,  .
the thing that i thought was interesting was that the critics , 
apparently it's going to win everything . 
uh , and i had been told , you know , you wouldn't notice that it was three hours long , and all this ,
that's true . 
i agree with that . 
um , i noticed yesterday in the paper , something said that it , 
i think it's been nominated for twelve awards 
and all the critics initially said that , you know , it wouldn't go anywhere , that it was just going to be a dud . 
so , it has surprised everybody . 
well , the interesting thing is i had heard that , 
and i tend to , i think , overreact occasionally when somebody tells me it's that great . 
and i guess that's what i really like . 
although , i must admit i did look at my watch after about an hour . 
did you ? 
have you seen sleeping with the enemy ? 
i've heard that's really great , though . 
you have to go see that one . 
and how about silence of the lamb ? 
you must really keep up . 
i do . 
i go every weekend .
i , uh , 
those are two definite must see movies , i think . 
well , sleeping with the enemy , isn't that a , 
is it a terror movie 
it's suspenseful . 
i don't think it's very t , 
i mean , there's not really any , uh , blood and guts in it or anything like that . 
it's more suspense . 
um , the other one , silence of the lambs , is kind of if somebody's not into that kind of stuff . 
it's pretty graphic at points . 
but , uh , i think they're both excellent movies . 
do you listen to gary cogill ? 
no . huhuh . *[[two utts
is , uh , 
do you know who he is ? 
somebody in south carolina told me about him . 
he's the movie critic . 
um , oh , you've , oh , 
he's a movie critic on channel eight in dallas . 
and uh , he has a talk show on the , k l i f . 
anyway , it's on from seven to nine , or something . 
and people call in 
and if you keep up with movies , it's kind of interesting . 
there's a certain a mount of dribble that they do . 
uh , they've got a couple of kids , ten or twelve years old , 
and they call in 
and they review movies . 
but it's , uh 
anyway , he , 
it's interesting . 
you listen to him 
and then you go watch the movie . 
in fact , people had just seen , 
i was listening sunday night a little bit when ,
but , anyway , it was , uh , the , 
it's interesting , though , 
i think he really , 
his heart was in it , 
but i don't think he really knew it was going to be as big as it was . 
i think it was something that he really wanted to do . 
he wanted to direct it , 
he wanted to star in it . 
you know , he enjoyed the story line 
and i think he really wanted it . 
and whether it won all kinds of awards or whether it just was okay at the box office , i think he would have been happy . 
because i think he did a good job 
and the selfsatisfaction he got out of it is much greater than any awards that they can give him . 
do you know who the guy was that was playing the wagon driver ? 
a little piece of trivia . 
you know , the guy when he first headed out from the army post . 
he plays on murphy brown . 
oh , he does ? 
as a recurring character every week ? 
can you ,
now see , i'd a never put those two together . 
that's one of those interesting pieces of trivia that somebody said , did you notice that ? 
but i thought , it , 
you think back , 
and yeah , 
it was him , but with a 
i mean , it's , uh , 
real scruffy looking .
real scruffy looking , 
and that he winds up playing in the movie . 
but i thought , it's good that , you know , 
it was a lot of fun . 
you think so ? 
um , i guess , 
goodbye sharon . 
good talking to you archie .
we , uh , 
well , uh , my husband is right now teaching an aerobics class . 
and , um , the 
how i met him was through , uh , the aerobics class that he used to teach . 
you're a student ? 
enjoying you know , uh , anything dealing with sports . 
so , and how do you feel about it ? .
uh , i am a person who wishes i had more time to exercise . 
i don't very often do things for the sake of exercise . 
i don't feel well unless i am exercising 
and i try to do things that involve exercise , 
but , i very rarely do things like , um , 
i've never done aerobics or any sort of structured , 
this is my exercise time 
 but , i do lots of outdoor sports and things , bicycling , uh , you know , mountaineering , a little mountaineering , this and that , 
and i spend a lot of time 
and i probably get more exercise than your average person . 
but , it's not a structured sort of thing , 
and i have to admit i have a certain resistance to the idea of exercising for exercising's sake , 
and perhaps , it's because somehow that implies to me it's not fun , or something like that . 
well i've , 
that's the way my mother stands on it . 
she feels like if it's something that you have to do , you know , 
 and , she doesn't enjoy it when it's a chore . 
so , um , and i feel that way too as far as , you know , just sitting and the idea of doing fifty situps or something , you know , 
you're a calcu , you know 
calculated down 
and do your calisthenics ,
is that why you like aerobics classes , because someone else is doing the counting for you , so ,
and , it's got , 
and i've always enjoyed dance . 
so it involves , you know , 
i can't get out to dance all the time 
would that we could .
 and it's more regulated , 
i mean you're using different parts of the body . 
so , it is like dance , 
and it's structured like that , 
but you have the music , and like you said , someone else is counting ,
you can just trust someone else to give you full exercise 
and all you do is follow along and enjoy yourself . 
but , i'm like you , 
i also , um , like to participate in , uh , things like , 
well , we just went to the , uh , myererson symphony run this past weekend , 
and that was a lot of fun 
and you get to meet different people ,
and it's something you can all , 
like our , 
we did it as a family , 
and , biking 
and i love to swim , 
so i love it when , you know , it's swimming weather , 
and , uh , 
well , you're talking to someone from california where it's often swimming weather .
i didn't realize that . 
i'm sorry . 
well , i'm in texas . 
i just assumed that i had , 
you wouldn't know that .
oh , i , 
so , well it's actually , 
it's interesting , because there are real regional differences . 
um , in california there's , uh , almost an assumption ,
i'm not . uh , 
there's an assumption that you do something for your physical fitness , at least in urban california . 
i don't know about rural california too well . 
but , in urban california it's just , you know , 
for all i know aerobics started out here . 
i don't know where they actually started , 
but you know , the craze really picked up big here 
and before that there was the running craze . 
and , they , 
california you know , tends to be a bit faddish , 
so , there must be something to some of them . 
and , uh , 
well , i think people are more inc , um , um , 
people from california seem to be more health motivated all around . i mean , as far as the diet , and everything . uh , the diet and , uh , just your health consciousness , 
and , i mean , it just ,
not just exercise , but ,
and , i , 
it's curious , i don't know why , don't know if it's , 
do you , 
does california have a , 
well , there's a sense of it being a package , 
i think . there is a sense of , you know , whole , 
there's a lot of , you know , 
you'll get organizations , like institutes for the whole health , or whatever . 
and , uh , oh uh , turned into a fairly well subscribed to , uh , newsletter ,
and , it doesn't deal with just exercise , or just stress management , or just diet , or anything . 
solid scientific ground . 
uh , it's just dispensed with these distinctions . 
 uh , so it's had that orientation for quite some time . 
um , there's been some progressive medical schools out here ,
and , um , 
there's a , 
which caused the other . 
you know , each developed a little bit and then would feed off one another and develop a little bit more , and a little bit more . 
the more money they put into it . 
i can see that . 
and , cause , i , 
from institutes of learning like that , i know that they've got to get their money somewhere , 
and somebody's got to be willing to pay for it , and believe in it , 
and , part of it is california ,
and some of them fizzled out 
and some of them were disastrous 
and others of them , um , had an impact on the society around here . 
and one of the ones that had an impact was , uh , people becoming interested in alternate practices , 
 i'm not sure  if it was a meditation practice , or if it was , you know , similar to a stress management practice or alternates to , uh , a m a approved medicine . 
uh , you have , you know , major , um , acupuncture schools and things out here . 
and you could have them around long enough 
and more and more people start believing them or wondering how to combine them with other things , 
and , before long , of health care and options 
is strongly considered one of them . 
the irony is its people in the cities , in my experience , that are most oriented towards doing the exercise . 
and , i guess because they spend all day in back of their desks . 
the average person out on the farm , now they drive fancy tractors as much as anything 
last thing , 
or they're older . 
pardon me . 
well , don't you think they tend to be older in the rural ar . 
i sometimes think that it's almost frantic effort on the part of the people in the city . 
oh , like everything else . 
i live in a rural area , 
the rat race to exercise .
like it's frantic , to , 
well i , 
as a fit person .
i mean you've , 
if you look at other cultures , 
like i know a little bit about people who were considered very healthy in china 
and they don't do very much vigorous exercise at all . 
but , they do a lot of low keyed , low impact , low stress exercise , 
and they combine it with a , you know , meditation or whatever . some sort of relaxation 
 and , they seem pretty , you know , 
they don't have the hard body . 
they don't have that perfect look , 
and an awful lot of exercise is sort of image conscious . 
but you know , they live to a hundred and ten some  , you know , 
and , that's , 
well , don't you think a lot of that is diet too ? 
and , a lot of that is diet . 
that's true . 
i mean , they eat a lot of carbohydrates , and not much fat .
and as we can see . 
well , i'm a practicing vegetarian 
so , uh , i've read a lot of information , knowing that to be true , 
what's that ? 
as am i . 
oh , are you also  , 
 well that's good as far as the cal , 
is that , um , pretty predominant as far as california do , doe , 
in the urban areas ? 
for example most restaurants in an urban area will have a little vegetarian section now . 
oh that's wonderful . 
well sort of modern looking restaurants will , 
you can , 
that's great , 
i mean , we , uh , 
it's such a trouble here . 
i mean , you just have to eat at home basically . 
i was wondering that , 
because i was actually applying for a job in texas , 
and , uh , 
 well of course in the cities , 
well , in the cities , 
we live close to dallas , 
so , uh , which , you know , 
you get , uh , an influx of a lot of people from all over the country , 
uh , it's definitely , 
it's changing to a degree , 
you don't really have that , 
i mean , you would think . 
uh , i'll just hand it off to you 
well , uh , the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time , are crafts 
and , uh , i've been involved in making , uh , hat stands and , uh , rag dolls and , uh , different type hats with , uh , flowers and roses , you know , and , uh , that kind of thing , straw hats and ,
and i enjoy it , 
it's relaxing . 
and you kind of get absorbed in it 
so the time goes by , you know , before you realize anything is going on . 
and i play the organ sometimes , uh , just for my own satisfaction . ot for anybody else's ears 
because i'm not that good at it , 
but i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while . 
oh really ? 
how about yourself ? 
well , oh , hobbies , gee whiz , 
i guess i got too many hobbies 
so i never have time to deal with them . 
i like photography a lot , 
oh , yeah , 
that's neat . 
uh , i used to do that a lot 
and then i like , um , 
we have a new child that will be a year old here next week , 
so i'll take a lot of pictures of her ,
oh , that's great , 
first one , you know how that is . 
and , um , uh , i play the guitar and a banjo . 
i mainly play the guitar a lot , 
i play about every night . 
and , um , i really love that , 
if i had a  druther   , 
if i could make it on the road , i'd like to play on like a bluegrass band or something , 
because that's , 
oh , that sounds nice . 
i like bluegrass , too . 
i've done it before in high school and college ,
and it's really a blast . 
my wife hates it , 
but that's the way life is , i guess . 
that's the hard part , right ? 
if you can do things together , that really helps a lot . 
we , uh , 
she's , uh , into aerobics , 
oh , that's good , too . 
and that went over real well , 
but , uh , that's about it there . 
oh , it's good 
and it's healthy , too . 
oh , yeah , 
we do that too , 
we have uh , a treadmill and , uh , a bicycle and that kind of stuff , 
we try to get twenty minutes like at least three for four times a week , you know . 
oh , that's great . 
that's great . 
and we like movies , 
that ki , 
that's , uh , 
spare time , 
with a child it's , kind of stra , 
we have , uh , 
we're looking for a babysitter 
so we've been out twice in this year so far .
so it's kind of , uh , become an issue you could say . 
um , hobbies , 
i like , messing around in your house building things , and , you know , 
oh yeah , 
that's great , too . 
we did some remodeling when we bought a house , 
we put a kitchen in and , um , that kind of stuff , and painting and some wallpapering , 
that's fun . 
it's really kind of fun . 
it is . 
it really is . 
especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty , 
i like things that , you know , two people can do , 
but i like the quiet of doing things away , you know , 
kind of gives you some space for yourself , 
and that's what i find in making the dolls and things , that it gives me something that i can create , 
and i like to crochet and knit . 
i made some afghans and that kind of stuff . 
i like doing things with my hands . 
sounds like it . 
do you like to cook ? 
i love to cook , too , 
i'm , uh , 
italian food .
oh , really ? 
pizzas and spaghettis and lasagnas and that kind of stuff . 
well , we're all skinny farts 
so , i , 
so when it comes to , 
i like to cook and eat and ,
it is . 
um , um , but it just , 
work in the garden , work around the yard , of course , 
do you do barbecues ? 
smoke them an , 
 well , uh , uh , smoking and all that stuff ? 
oh , yeah , 
all that stuff that's bad for you . 
i lived in abilene for a little while ,
oh , sure , 
and we used to go to joe allen's barbecue , 
and , uh , oh , that was great . 
oh , yeah . 
really great , 
that's , uh , 
they have some nice stuff down there . 
i miss it .
well , yeah , 
uh , it's , uh , 
uh , there's pluses to everything , 
oh , yeah . 
but , you know , seems like there's just so many things to do down here , 
i like the sports , 
i play a lot of racquetball . 
  i did horseback riding , too , 
in fact , when my children were growing up , we always had horses 
and , uh , that was kind of for them , 
but they weren't as interested in it as we were , you know , 
so , uh , that was a real , 
i'd say probably for maybe fifteen years , we dabbled in that , you know , 
we always had horses around , 
and i really enjoyed that , 
 oh , that's great , 
sounds like you , 
and i was disappointed when i went to texas . 
i didn't see that many of them . 
you really don't . 
you have to look real hard to see a lot of things besides concrete , uh , 
i know , 
i know , 
it's true . 
there's buildings and concrete and a lot of people 
and that's about it down here , 
and so , 
but , uh , that's great . 
well , sounds like you have a lot of nice hobbies there . 
you too , 
well , great , 
well look , uh , 
i know it's probably late for you , 
i enjoyed speaking with you 
me too . 
have a good weekend . 
bye , now . 
since i'm in school i don't , like , basically have a monthly budget because i'm living off my dad , 
 but the thing the beginning of the semester when you go to pay for everything , everything is pretty rough , 
but he controls that part 
but , then whenever , you know , 
it's like , once the semester starts i'm the one who has to control how much spending there is . 
and the only thing that i basically spend my money on is just food 
 um , so , 
what about tuition and rent ? 
who takes care of that ? 
well , the thing is that i live in a dorm . 
so , uh , what happens is you pay six hundred dollars at the beginning or even before school starts . 
and then the tuition is also the same thing . 
so , the thing on groceries 
and that's about it . 
but the thing , uh , also is that , you know , like if you want to go out like if you want to go to a restaurant or something , then i have to moderate that because it's like i can't go eat out at a nice restaurant and spend twenty dollars , um , you know , three times a week . 
you can't do that very often . 
so , i mean , it's , 
i can spend that money 
but it's not what i want to spend it on , you know . 
are you working anywhere while you are going to school ? 
because , um , they don't allow me to work since , uh , i'm a foreign student . 
oh , okay . 
and so the government doesn't allow me to work . 
so all the money comes from home . 
so , you got to make , uh , 
so how do you keep track of where you are in your monthly spending ? 
and so , the thing i can tell like , uh , 
i get all my money out of the teller . 
and besides see one of my biggest expenses is telephone calls since i have to call , you know , international . 
where do you call to ? 
and so the bas , 
one of the problems is that i spend too much money on phone bills . 
talk too long . 
well , that's , 
they want me to call down there every so often . 
so i doesn't matter about the money because we need to hear from you . 
so you call him collect ? 
 what makes you   ,
any , um , 
basically the united states is the cheapest country to call out of . 
and , um , because it's considered a luxury in other countries . 
oh , okay . 
so , you just call him direct 
and then , 
since it's his money anyway , you know . 
and you get the bill and send it to him ? 
so , it's basically , you know , 
like , it's not too much money , 
and it's not too little money , 
because , um , he really wants me to concentrate on my studies . 
what are you studying ? 
i'm doing masters in computer science and computer engineering . 
and what do you think you'll do with that ? 
with those degrees ? 
well , um , here up to a year . 
and hopefully get a job after that . 
um , computer communications and data transmissions . 
oh , okay , 
so you want to find a , uh , data transmissions , 
you're looking for , uh , um , long distance 
and , um , 
and does your wife work ? 
she does , uh , 
well , it's kind of hard to say now days , um , other than taking care of the house , she does a lot of sewing herself . 
oh , okay . 
and she gets paid for that 
so she brings some money in . 
she is trying to start her own business where she does that full time .
and , uh , do that on a full time basis here in town . 
 and you have a monthly budget ? 
well , sort of . 
and we know what bills have to be paid , 
and , uh , we pay as many of those bills that can be paid with the monthly budget , 
so , you don't have any problem in , um , overcharging on your credit card , and stuff like that . 
we're like everybody else , you know , 
we've got several credit cards that sometimes , um , instead of paying them all off every month maybe you have to slip some and you pay part of it this month and part of it next month especially around christmas time . 
you know , that's when everybody goes crazy on charging stuff . 
well then , uh , see , uh , that's one of the points which i don't see , 
like i don't give a lot of gifts during christmas 
and i don't like to give any at all 
 because the thing i'll ask somebody , you know , 
you kno , no , 
that's something that you can use . 
because i needed a backpack . 
so , he gave me a backpack , 
and i knew he needed an alarm clock . 
so , i bought him an alarm clock . 
 necessary things   , no frivolous gifts . 
but , um , the thing is , especially remember when i was down in argentina to me it was ridiculous , 
because you know , you have to , 
once a year you go out 
and you spend all this money on all these people , 
and some you don't care about , you know , 
it's like , 
that's true , 
why bother . 
is , that , um . 
well , especially being a college student your , 
i don't know that you need to be involved in a lot of frivolous gift giving , you know , 
that effects the budget especially around , uh , christmas time 
at the end of the semester you've got finals and lots of bills i would suspect . 
what about when you have breaks like , um , christmas or between sessions ? 
well , for example , we had spring break now , 
and i went skiing 
and i spent around like , maybe , two hundred dollars . 
i expect so . 
 uh , but you know , its like , um . 
you've got to budget that though . 
you've got to save up  in able to do  that , right ? 
i mean , 
because you know , it's like , we were saying , let's go eat out before spring break . 
let's see how much money we have afterwards . 
right ,   .
and if i felt like i spent way to much then , um , i won't go out , you know , 
and so , like my roommate went home , 
i went skiing over the carolina mountains which aren't anything , 
i guess it was worth it , 
sure it is , 
any time you can get away , and , 
you know , it was a nice place . 
especially if you live on campus , and you don't have a car , you just go crazy . 
i know the feeling . 
is that okay ? 
all right . 
all right . 
well , nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
 have a good time . 
all right . 
what do you like to cook ? 
well i like to cook foods i like to eat . 
i like to eat italian food best . 
and i find that that's pretty easy to cook because a lot of it is one dish meals , type things and ,
that would be good for a dinner party , you know , to cook that because you don't have to deal with eight different things ,
is that what you usually cook when you have a party . 
and so , um , yeah , 
that sounds good . 
um , fattening .
how about you , 
what do you like to cook ? 
uh , we , 
it's funny that , um , we're talking about this , 
we just had a dinner party 
and we had , um , 
our senior pastor and his wife came over . 
and i catered to their diet is the only thing , though , 
so it wasn't something i really wanted to make . 
i really wanted to make red beans and rice with  .
oh yeah . 
because i'm from new orleans originally . 
and , um , i was going to make that , red beans and rice with those cajun sausage and french bread with garlic butter and stuff , 
and , uh , well there's salad 
and then for desert i really wanted to make , um , just brownies 
or french donuts would have been good , 
but it's real hard to make them . 
they don't really come out like they do in new orleans , up here , 
i don't know why . 
oh really . 
i don't know if it's me or the water or the recipe i have 
humidity or something . 
um , that's what i want . 
that's what i like to make is just real neat stuff like that 
kind of like the italian , 
it's really good , 
but instead i catered to their diet 
so i made baked chicken in the crock pot 
and , um , it was good and everything , 
it had all the vegetables in it , 
but , it seemed kind of boring compared  , 
it uh , kind of down played compared to what you would like , huh . 
do you find yourself , um , with all the , um , cholesterol that you entertain ? 
i find it changing the way that i eat , but not the way i entertain , 
because i guess i feel like if they're on a diet like that , i'm going to , you know , honor that , 
but if it's just 
another couple came , um , over a couple weeks later 
and i made , 
what did i make that night . 
i made a roast , 
and i made , um , uh , 
i can't believe this 
my husband broke the coffee pot i just bought yesterday . 
oh no . 
i can't believe that . 
anyway , but i asked , 
when  ricky  and  carrie  came over we made , um , a pot roast with rice and gravy and salad and the whole bit . 
and normally you know , the calories and the fat in it . 
and i made blueberry cobbler 
and we had extra crust with it , 
it was so fattening . 
that sounds good . 
but , i don't think we gained any weight from it 
well , every once in a while i think i feel the same way . 
when i'm entertaining , i don't take that thing into consideration unless it's really , really , 
like a lot of women will turn down dessert if it's too rich simply because they don't want the extra calories , 
so i think dessert is the only thing that i kind of down play , sometimes . 
i made an apple pan  downy  when the pastor and his wife came over 
and she didn't eat it . 
oh yeah . 
but i did bake apples so that it would be , not brownies , you know . 
i figured there was less calories in apple pan  downy  than in fudge brownies . 
so , um , i've  read  a good brownie recipe . 
oh , that's good . 
 uh , anyway , so i guess that's about what i did when i entertained . 
so , do you have anything else you want to say about it ? 
um , nothing comes to mind right off , 
so i guess not . 
well it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
bye , bye . 
i would like to talk about , just briefly what happened over there in saudi arabia in the political context . 
i think it's , uh , refreshing to see uh , the support that the president got from the american people . 
i read an interesting article in the paper that discussed , uh , that , uh , 
seemed that every other time a president tried to get support for an action like , uh , uh , president carter and his thing with the hostage crisis ,
and this time president bush did it through action 
and he , 
or , uh , i mean , he left almost no alternative . 
that's right .
and it was very interesting how he did it 
and , uh , i mean , i'm an air force officer , 
so uh , 
i'd certainly , uh , 
i mean i think it's great that all the support . 
i have , uh , friends of mine from the air , 
i'm an engineer and work in the rolm laboratory , 
but other guys here on base , 
this is a b fiftytwo base where i work , 
and they're getting a tremendous amount of support out of it . 
that's great , um , 
if you remember , the vote in the congress to authorize war , if necessary , was actually pretty close . 
it was . 
and if my memory serves me right , i believe a majority of democrats may even have opposed it , 
it was , 
i don't know the exact figure 
but uh , i mean almost certainly would have to be . 
just based on uh , the disparity of , excuse me , democrats and republicans in congress he'd think that it would have to have been , um . 
that's right . 
and , uh , i 
gosh uh , uh , 
i mean how many years are we going to wait 
what do you do with the people that are over there in the mean time . 
i think that was , 
all those factors played a part in , you know , uh , the , 
no doubt . 
everyone was discussing whether we should , uh , wait longer , 
but , i know that there's a lot of reasons to wait longer 
but i think we were genuinely concerned about their military capability 
and uh , i think we over estimated it , 
but still ,
i think so too . 
and , we were worried that they were getting dug in 
and , uh . 
well they were , 
they couldn't , 
it's true 
saddam thought he had the whole thing , uh , figured out uh , 
well , had we done a frontal assault it probably would have worked more to his favor . 
that's right , 
that's true . 
that's interesting , 
i think , uh , this political situation over there now is , uh , uh , 
it'll be interesting to see what comes out of it whether this opposition will , uh , uh , 
today the turks , uh , agreed to support the kurds , which is something they've never done before 
um , interesting . 
to reconcile relations with the israelis , 
so it's like  , 
well , baker is really not very much pro israel . 
and did you know john sununu is , uh , half arab ? 
no , uh , 
because i used to live in , uh , massachusetts , 
but , uh , 
in fact , when he was governor of new hampshire , i believe . 
new hampshire . 
i believe he was the only one of fifty governors that voted against some kind of resolution of support for israel a few years back . 
oh my gosh . 
and , uh , now he is a conservative , 
but he is not a conservative that favors israel , 
and that concerns me greatly . 
well , i don't , 
i'd certainly , uh , support israel uh , in their handling of their foreign policy , 
i support that . 
i think that is a positive thing for them after , um , uh , thousands of years , 
uh , they ha , 
i think they in , 
when they more or less decided they weren't going to take it anymore , 
and , uh . 
well , they didn't have much choice , 
they could either fight or die . 
exactly , exactly 
i lost my train of thought here . 
 uh , um , so , okay 
so i can't say whether that i'm pro israel or anti israel . 
i mean , i'd like to see them resolve something in that situation and get some stability in the region 
and looks uh , that the joining of forces for this , uh , uh , desert shield and desert storm thing ended up being a positive thing . 
it is a positive thing , um , 
and so you basically have , uh , mutually exclusive interests , 
either israel is going to occupy the area , 
or the arabs are going to occupy the area 
and i'm just not sure that there's going to be any easy permanent solution . 
somebody's going to , 
and i think that's the problem the p l o has is that uh , some more violent than others , some with a certain agenda different than the others , or they split , 
they end up becoming divisive themselves . 
uh , i , 
it's interesting , 
it is . 
 i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months , 
but , uh , that's , 
i commend israel for their restraint in not responding to the scud attacks . 
i know , 
 i mean that's absolutely unprecedented 
that was ,
and i mean that's never happened before , 
and i don't know if it will ever happen again 
may not . 
well it's been fun , i enjoyed talking with you . 
okay , uh , 
i guess , uh , well maybe the computer will pair us up together another time . 
you never know . 
all right . 
bye , bye . 
bye , bye . 
hello there . 
did i reach the dallas area ? 
i beg your pardon ? 
dayton , ohio , 
i'm from north carolina . 
oh , you're from north carolina . 
where in north carolina ? 
in raleigh . 
raleigh , 
well , my name's mary . 
so , um , do you , well , 
oh , okay , 
because i'm down at n c state . 
and so i took a class , 
all right , 
so , uh , what do you think , that , uh , 
what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america ? 
oh , if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person . 
but what are the steps ? 
well , you have to see , 
or has crime increased , 
and if so , why has crime increased ? 
well , see the problem uh , you know , as you go from the country to a city , crime always increases , right ? 
because in the country , people still respect , uh , the property of other people . 
and so , as , 
and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city . 
now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities , 
and they rush to get the same thing . 
they say , why can't we have the same things that these other people have , 
and the thing that we can do is , we need money for drugs , 
and what we have to do is , we have to go , uh , get some stuff , steal it , and then , you know , just resell it . 
it's easy , 
you said the magic word there . 
which one ? 
and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased . 
uh , that's , uh , the main reason i think , uh , everywhere 
because , uh , you have deaths . 
i mean , i mean , you have murders 
and you have , you know , people stealing other people's stuff , 
and that's 
a lot of it has to do with drugs . 
oh , yes . 
it doesn't have to do , 
i mean , the thing is that , you know , it's like you might be standing somewhere , right , 
and like let's say you know , you're driving out 
and you're driving back home 
and it's late at night . 
and you stop by one of these , you know , twentyfour hour , you know , gas stations joints . 
and , uh , somebody walks in there with a gun . 
i mean , they're going to want the money , 
and you can tell by the people who are always caught , that these people are there to get money for drugs . 
i mean , they don't want the money uh , so they can do something else with it . 
they don't want the money for food , 
that's for sure . 
and so . 
 well , but you know , uh , perhaps , not strange , but something that many people don't realize , is that you can go back as far as nineteen fiftyone and fiftytwo and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids , 
because , uh , i'm a retired educator . 
and , in fiftyone and fiftytwo , the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs , how to recognize the pushers 
so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years , 
and we're just really , uh , uh , now , trying to , uh , figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge . 
 uh , a song that i know which says , you know , tha , 
it's like , in , uh , nineteen eightyeight , nineteen eightynine , the local , state , and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america , 
and , uh , their figures , i think are so 
i mean it's like , on crime in the country itself . 
what you're doing is , you , you know , 
it's like , you have other things , you know , 
you have the aids 
we're going to solve , try to solve 
and then .
and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers , the big dealers in drugs ,
but those people never get caught . 
the people that 
that's right , 
they'll never get caught . 
see , their theory is that if i'm surrounded , and i'm going to be caught , i'm going to try to find my way through , 
and they're not going to take me alive . 
but i have such a big army outside of my place , that nobody can touch me . 
that's right . 
but they'll , 
you know , it's like , 
of course , i mean i might be , you know , the leading drug dealer here , 
but you won't find me dealing in drugs , 
i mean , there's no connection 
that's right . 
that's right , 
and , they , 
one person doesn't know the other person down the line . 
but the guy at the very top , the one uh , and had the political 
because it sure is monstrous in this country . 
at a party on saturday , 
and this guy comes over , 
he started talking to me , 
and this guy was from jamaica , right . 
and he's got his little brother selling drugs .
he goes , you know . 
and , uh , in the movie good fellows . 
did you see it ? 
in one part , the guy goes out of jail , 
and within , uh , two months , he has all his house payments gone 
and he had enough money to , you know , 
it's like , those guys , at one point , you know , they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it .
really , you know , 
even in our prison systems they're finding that they're having drugs smuggled into them . 
that was also in the movie . 
so hello mary . 
been nice talking with you . 
we've been talking for five minutes ? 
i beg your , 
we've been talking for a little bit . 
i appreciate the call . 
i enjoyed talking with you . 
all right , okay , 
same here . 
cindy , have you seen dances with wolves ? 
have you ? 
it's not , 
the length isn't too long ? 
oh goodness no . 
you don't even realize it , you know . 
one that , you know , 
it was too long 
and they thought you know , at certain points that it was going to end , 
and it didn't , 
and it kept going on 
oh , i thought it was great . 
now , i've seen , you know , some different clips of it , um , 
and it looks good , 
it's just i haven't had the time to go to the movies lately .
well , yeah , 
and i heard a story about they're on a buffalo hunt . 
and they have a particular child actor , uh , who's being supposedly run down by a buffalo . 
and when they were trying to film that , the buffalo that they used for that scene was neil young's buffalo . 
i can't remember what they said his name was . 
but he has a fetish for oreo cookies . 
oh  , 
that'd work for me , 
i thought that was really funny . 
now i've seen another clip of , um , the guy that plays in murphy brown , 
i don't know his name , 
but he played i mean , very dirty , 
oh , yeah . 
oh , i saw the one clip of him 
it was first , 
i guess he was taking kevin costner to like the site where he was going to be or whatever . 
oh , yeah . 
that was rather , um , gross .
the wagon driver . 
but other than that i've heard um , the scenery in it 
and , uh , the costuming *[[slash error
the only thing about the costuming my husband remarked that , um , the indians all appeared to be wearing new things . 
oh really . 
and they should have taken them out and rolled them in the dirt a little more 
so , they did very authentic reproductions of the , 
the styles , 
but they didn't age it 
but it was a very good movie . 
well , i guess i will have to see it then . 
what have you seen lately ? 
um , actually have been to the movies , um , 
i think the last movie i saw was misery . 
oh , i didn't see that . 
oh , very suspenseful . 
i don't like stephen king . 
i really don't either , 
but i went with someone , 
and once i was there , i couldn't believe . 
i mean , it's an excellent movie . 
i wasn't sure , 
because , uh , just generally , you know , that kind of scary stuff i just don't want to have anything to do with it . 
it's not necessarily scary as it is suspenseful . 
i mean it's not . 
i think i heard somebody talking about that she cuts his foot off or something , you know . 
in the book apparently she cuts his feet off , 
but in the movie she disables him , but not by cutting his feet . 
um , she breaks both of his ankles . 
and that i couldn't watch , 
 but , you know , you could tell when it was coming . 
so yeah , um , 
that was so that he couldn't leave her , 
cause she , 
it still just seems a little twisted to me .
i'm not sure i would have enjoyed that at all . 
well , as far as that goes , 
i mean , you wouldn't like to see anything happen to anybody , 
but it was just how she got so caught up , 
her emotions 
 and she feel madly in love with this writer . 
and there was this , 
but she was a killer , 
and had been someone that had killed other people 
 but no one knew that . 
oh , yeah . 
so . but . 
so , yeah , 
we just haven't had the time to go to the movies lately , 
i know , 
we don't see movies at the movies a lot . 
the last , 
we did go see dances with wolves 
and we went to see not without my daughter , 
but mostly we wait until they come out on video tape , 
and then we rent them .
now i want to see sleeping with the enemy . 
oh , yeah 
that looks really good too . 
that looks good . 
and there were a couple others that i just haven't had the time . 
and silence of the lambs . 
now see i . 
i'm intrigued by it , 
but i'm not sure i want to go see it yet .
i don't think i want to see that either . 
i know , 
i don't think i could . 
i think , uh , 
well , now , we had some friends that went to see it 
and they said it was okay . 
so , it might not be as , 
i think they may be playing up 
now , we went to see the jagged edge . 
oh , i liked that movie . 
so , it seems like , you know , that kind of 
uhhuh , um . 
well , i guess that's about it . 
it was nice . 
 maybe we'll talk to you again . 
it was nice talking to you . 
let's see . 
i think , uh , 
but , anyway i think that , um , we are paying a lot in taxes , 
but i think that we have a government and we have a lot of freedoms , and we have a lot of things that the governments do with our money . 
um , we're probably one of the only countries in the world that has all the things that we have . 
the , you know , 
as far as the quality of the streets , the school systems , um , the hospital stuff that the government gives money to . um , the , you know , all the things that the government does like that . uh , i think they need to manage it a little bit better , 
but i don't think , uh , anybody is just going to come in and fix it in a couple of weeks , because they've been messing it up for many years , now . 
and you're right . 
you know , we do have a good government . 
we do have a lot of things you know , that , you know , the taxes are there to support , 
but i do think they're mismanaged 
and i think that sometimes it's i don't know , to easy of an answer . 
it seems to say , i'll tax them if you can't get enough money , instead of trying to figure out how to cut budgets or cut spending or , you know , get all of the waste out of the spending . 
uh , i don't know what y'all are paying in dallas , 
but , you know , it seems like we pay the  state   , 
you know there's a , 
the taxes set by , you know , the state and the city can add theirs , 
and the county adds theirs , 
and , you know , we're paying almost eight percent sales tax , right now . which seems to me nuts . 
i came from california 
and , you know , when i left there , we paid six cents on the dollar , 
and that was like one of the highest in the nation . 
i think it's seven here . 
seven point something . 
ourselves is seven point seven five . 
whole state . 
it drives me crazy . 
but yet they allow the sales tax to go up and up and up and up 
and they don't do anything about it .
where are you at ? 
what state ? 
i'm in lubbock , texas . 
oh , really . 
we're still one of few that don't have the , uh , state tax   .
that's true . 
and i did pay state tax in california , 
 what did you call it , the sales tax , is just getting outrageous to pay . 
that's true . 
you don't sound like you're from dallas . 
where do you come from originally 
i've lived in the dallas area here since i was like four . 
oh , okay . 
so . uh , it's , i don't know , an urban area , i guess 
i don't know . 
you just managed to escape the real texan accent , 
i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there . 
i've just lived here , 
but , i don't know , 
i do , 
i can think of all the biblical things about it , too . 
what did they say to , uh , 
i can't think of the scripture . 
that's right . 
so , you know , even in the story where they had to pay the taxes , the disciples ,
and , uh , i thought of those two things when i was holding for a long time . 
oh , were you really ,
well , you know , um , back then what they tried to do , you know , 
the   would always try to stump jesus , try to give him something that would contradict himself , 
and so that's what they were trying to do with the tax situation . 
you render unto god what is god's . 
and , uh , you know , of course , there , 
i don't think they really cared about the answer , 
they just wanted to try and catch him in something .
 but i believe in paying taxes 
and , i mean , yeah , 
like everybody else , i try to take as many deductions as i can , 
oh , sure . 
  you know , i don't want to pay more than i have to , 
and i get outraged when i feel like they go up for useless reasons , 
but i believe that they're necessary . 
so , i really do , 
do you deal with taxes much in what you do when you work 
especially , this year and last year . 
um , i have been married for just a few years , 
so i've had to really switch around from the e z form to the , uh , 
schedule a 
well , yeah . 
all the deductions and all that . 
did you notice that when they passed the new simplified tax act , it seemed like it made everything harder ? 
i saw , that , too . 
i didn't notice anything simplified about it , except that they took away the deductions ,
we're looking at buying a house , 
and that was one of the main pluses that we have about buying a house . 
and it will help tremendously . 
we bought ours five years ago 
and it's 
the one thing , 
it seems like you make those payments every month 
and at the end of the year you've paid all interest and no principles . 
so that will definitely help in taxes and what you will get back . 
there's a thing i just , 
i've been trying to learn as much as i can about it , 
if you pay , 
i know i get paid twice a month , every two weeks , 
that's once a month . 
well , i get twenty six paychecks ,
that's right . 
so if you pay your rent or your house payment every two weeks ,
that's right . 
and if have you a thirty year note , it will take like seven or plus years off of your note . 
that's right . 
my parents , uh , bought a home in san diego about four or five years ago , 
and they did that . 
they thought their payment was automatically taken out like every other wednesday , 
oh , yeah . 
and that's exactly right . 
though the note is thirty years , she said it's going be paid off in twenty or twenty one years ,
just because of exactly what you said , 
you're making one more month's payment every year . 
and that's going on the principle , 
it doesn't pay any interest , 
and when we bought this house , we looked at doing a fifteen year note , because it added more to the payment ,
it was a good payoff for being able to pay it off sooner . 
that's what we're looking at , fifteen or maybe twenty . 
we're not going to go longer than twenty . 
but , we're taking our time . 
we're going to try to make our decision by july . 
well , that's good , though . 
well , we just started two or three weeks ago . 
and we're not going to just kill ourselves 
just two or three houses a week at the most . 
well , that's good , though . 
is it kind of a buyer's market down there ? 
well , that's good . 
credit union has nine percent interest . 
that's pretty excellent . 
so that's , 
i don't know , 
we couldn't think of a better time to buy than now . 
that's good . 
but , anyway . well , um , i can't think of a whole lot more to say . 
well , i can't either . 
i appreciate the call , though . 
me , too . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
same here . 
my wife , uh , she went to , uh , the school out there in lubbock . 
in lubbock ? 
just a second . 
go ahead . 
but anyway , 
so she was at school out here ? 
well , what was her name ? 
cathy walker . 
i didn't know any walker's . 
well , good luck in your house hunting . 
thanks a lot . 
y'all work at t i ? 
oh , really . 
that's interesting . 
i work in the  waiver  .
do you really , 
because that's , 
i work with elma . 
oh , really . 
and i used to work , 
i did all of their  capital  and financial planning for about eight years . 
oh , wow . 
and then i have been in human resources for the last two years 
and i work with those same people all those nine years , 
i'm , uh , turning in a capital request right now , 
you are . 
that's funny that's where you're from . 
a machine that puts  back grind  tape on and off the  waivers  .
so you work in  back grind   ? 
oh , okay . 
not officially , 
but that's pretty much what i do . 
and do you    ? 
and   .
well good deal . 
what did you think of sam ? 
uh , oh , i like him , 
he's hard , 
but we needed that . 
well , that's good . 
he was very good for lubbock when he came to , you know , 
it was the same kind of thing , 
he had a lot of good results . 
that's what he said here . 
he's gotten us into a linear flow that we've never been in before . 
well , good . 
that's been a real big plus . 
he's broadened , um , the devices that we're making , too ,
oh , okay . 
well , that's good . 
anyway , well , it was nice to talk to you . 
well , you too , 
they're are going to interrupt us any minute now , 
i can tell . 
well , i know they will , 
and besides my daughter wants me to put her to bed . 
me , too . 
well , have a good day . 
you , too . 
why do you think it , uh , sounds , 
do you think we should adopt it ? 
you don't ? 
and just the general , uh , background , 
the history of our country has been inches 
and i don't think there's a big advantage in going to the metric system . 
it's going to disorient and confuse a lot of people for years and years 
and there are going to be people who die because of it because they don't understand , uh , you know , simple things from the amount of medicine they should take to how fast they can drive 
and it's not in our national consciousness to do it . 
we've always measured things in the english system 
our land is in acres , 
our people aren't going to understand what 
i agree with you . 
i don't think we should either even though i know there are benefits to the metric system , 
i don't think the benefits of the metric system outweigh the disadvantages that would happen to the people in america 
 and also the , uh , 
i don't know 
it seems almost like it's a peer pressure thing is why we keep wanting to do it is so we'll look good to the other nations 
because i think that's an area that the other nations , especially europe , look down on us like oh , we're just backward wayward children who still use this backward system , who haven't really attained it yet . 
and i feel it's just pride of why they keep trying to push it on us . 
and it's like , hey , we're content with this .
it's probably not as accurate , 
probably , you know , intellectually doesn't , 
it's not as sound intellectually , but , like you said i mean , come on . 
i had six years of college 
and i don't know the metric system and i don't care to learn it 
 and i'm not some kind of an idiot , 
i just , 
and it's easy to trans , 
we have a computer for just about everything now 
and if it's necessary to translate back and forth between them , it can be done 
 because i'm a mechanical engineer 
and i've had to work when i was designing packages for people , 
i mean i had to work both systems 
and it was not hard 
and you can get a cat cam system that can take any design you want 
and you can push a button 
and it'll convert every measurement on there 
there's a lot of 
like you're educated , 
i'm educated , 
my husband is , 
but , i mean , a lot of people are flat not educated 
and if i have a hard time , you know 
or i don't know how much of the 
but a large percentage probably over half of the rest of the population 
and if we can't take it and use it easily , well , how can you put that on , like , elderly people and 
oh , yeah , 
it's just , 
i think it's still good they do cover the system . 
i think it should still be taught in schools . 
and they do , 
i know now because i , 
even when i was in elementary school years ago 
 and that's acceptable . 
i think it failed , too , 
the thing americans have so much stress on them right now . 
i mean if you look at the average family it's , like , man , they barely have time to stop and get gas , much less to try and figure out how much gas they're really getting and 
you know you need twenty gallons , but you need how many liters .
and it's just like another thing 
the american family doesn't need any more pressure . 
just leave them alone , 
let them measure their  drinking  water in cups 
and   it just doesn't make that much difference in the average life 
and the scientific community and places where it's needed 
and the rest of the world , i mean , we are , 
it's not , 
we may not be the top , 
i don't know if we're the top , 
we're one of the top superpowers of the world . 
it may be arrogant , 
but i mean , let them come to us .
that's kind of the way i feel about it . 
we can convert , 
it's kind of like expecting everyone to suddenly speak german .
it is 
 because it is another language , 
 and , instead of  saying  the world speak german we found out that we can translate .
and that's what i think we ought to do with the metric system . 
that's funny . 
well , that's good . 
i think we kept it at real good . 
is that all we need to say ? 
it's been nice talking to you . 
you , too . 
i think that was good . 
that was the best one . 
usually i get distracted off the topic . 
you know what i mean . 
and we'll end up , one man was telling me about his grandfather in lithuania , 
and we were talking about income tax or something . 
all right . 
and i just , 
well , good talking to you . 
anyway , i appreciate it . 
have a good day . 
well , like i told you before ,   .
and you're talking about credit cards . 
we put ours up . 
i mean i had a delightful evening one night cutting a bunch of those suckers up . 
um , i wish i had . 
well , you should try it . 
well , i , 
it was done for me after a while . 
uh , i had a business going . 
and this was back in the eighties . 
i don't know if you remember the gold and silver prices and all that . 
but , uh , i had a coin shop , 
and everything was going great while gold and silver was up , 
and it started falling . 
so i started paying expenses and stuff on my credit cards , 
and things got worse and worse , 
and finally , boom .
you lost your business ? 
oh , gol . 
what a nightmare .
it was . 
i ended up going into bank , you know , 
it was one of those things uh , 
oh , it'll get better next week , you know . 
things will pick up . 
and , so , there i was in old bankruptcy court . 
well , you weren't charging gold and silver were you ? 
oh , yeah . 
oh , you can ? 
oh , yeah , 
and , uh , you know , they take payment any way they can get it . 
oh , that's a nightmare .
course i was getting the money back , 
because i was selling it . 
i wasn't buying , you know , just to hold onto it . 
uh , but it was things like , you know , rent and phone bills and advertising and all that other good stuff that ate them all up . 
well , i remember before i got married , 
you know when you graduate from college they'll send you all those 
of course you fill them all out because you're honored . 
and , uh , i had stuff for like sanger harris , 
and , you know , it got up like to couple of hundred dollars , 
i wasn't thinking a thing about it . 
that's the way they suck you in . 
i was just stupid , 
and every time they had a sale , there i was . 
because , you know , get such good bargains . 
and i don't know . 
well , just today in the mail got my guaranteed acceptance by , uh , american express . 
oh , yeah , 
we've been getting those . 
i went back to school and got my master's , 
and they started sending those things to me again . 
as soon as you're a graduate student they get your name . 
they did . 
and , uh , course , i guess i've been purged from their records . 
i used to have an american express . 
uh , back when i had my business i got one . 
and on my very first bill , 
because i was using the american express strictly for the travel expenses . 
and the bill would come in , 
and i'd pay it . 
and the very first bill , i paid it , 
so i didn't do anything about it . 
two weeks later i get another letter , even nastier , 
and i looked at that , 
so by this time my checks had come back from the bank . 
turned out they weren't cheeky . 
they were , i tell you . 
they don't talk about they're charging that enormous fee every year . 
so what is it now ? 
it's up to fiftyfive on the gold card . 
it's eightyfive for the optima . 
or , i'm sorry no , 
what do you mean fiftyfive ? 
you mean fiftyfive dollars ? 
but then , what's the interest ? 
well , now , that's the card , see . 
and interest is like eighteen or something . 
oh , yeah , 
it's , um , 
well , of course on the green card you have to pay it when the bill comes in , so there isn't any . 
but on the optima card it's , 
um , let's see , right now it's running at about . 
it's not too bad . 
it's about sixteen and a half percent , which is pretty good , as far as credit cards go . 
well , credit cards . 
well , they're dangerous . 
you know , my parents don't hardly use them . 
mine don't either , 
mine don't either . 
they , uh , 
my mom uh , has a mastercard and a visa card , 
and that's it . 
i've got all my gas cards , because i don't want to carry money around . 
i'll do that . 
now i do use gas cards . 
now impact is kind of bad too , though . 
you know . especially if you forget to record those little suckers . 
plastic is just too easy , 
i mean 
well , and you're tempted if you've got cash , a little bit of cash , and you don't have enough for the purchase , right . 
of course , you got to charge it and keep your cash . 
i got into all kinds of trouble doing that .
oh , my husband says i might buy it , 
but i don't really usually consider that an option . 
maybe that's how we got in trouble . 
and , uh , 
but , i'm kind of , uh , grateful for the experience because it's taught me a lot of restraint . 
well , it makes you feel good when you whip out the cash instead of your plastic . 
uh , i just went out and got a new v c r yesterday with cash . 
and , it's , 
do you work with t i ? 
i have to wait for things to go on sale .
but there's always a sale . 
especially on electronic goods 
especially now . 
what is that thing i saw , 
circuit world or something . 
have you been in there ? 
their prices aren't that terrific . 
they used to be , 
but they've got to pay for all that national advertising now . 
oh , it's national ? 
i think i've seen two around dallas . 
they're all over the country now . 
 well , what else   , 
they used to be good . 
i remember when they first opened up . 
they did have good bargains . 
i don't know if you have a place there called , uh , 
or you probably have something similar . 
we call it service merchandise . 
you got service merchandise . 
it used to be service merchandise was the place to go . 
and , uh , circuit city came along 
and that was the place to go to get your t v s and washer and dryers and refrigerators and all that . 
and then after the years went by , they just sort of kept creeping up on price , 
and actually service merchandise is cheaper than them now . 
so much for circuit city . 
so . okay , 
who do you work for ? 
i don't , 
i'm a graduate student . 
i'm a professional student . 
sounds wonderful . 
it is . 
we were talking about that just today . 
it's great . 
we could be just lifelong students . 
it is great . 
i love it . 
where are you going to school ? 
n c state . 
what's that ? 
uh , north carolina state . 
so you're on spring break ? 
so where are you ? 
where am i ? 
what do you mean , where ? 
in raleigh . 
oh , okay . 
the burgeoning metropolis of raleigh . 
what a dead place .
is it ? .
i've got a nice little business at home , 
 and i sit around and tinker with that most of the time . 
so what are you getting your degree in ? 
 um , uh , human factors . 
and what do you do with it ? 
not a thing .
well , what is it ? 
it's really looking at systems and design systems and seeing how people interact with them . 
so it's sociology . 
well , it's more psychology and engineering . 
my master's is in industrial engineering . 
so you're working on your doctorate ? 
oh lord . 
p h d in human factors . 
get you a little   plaque . 
oh , yeah . 
i b m , uh , 
i mean , uh , a lot of people use human factors , 
but i b m is what i'm looking at right now . 
aren't they laying off several thousand people ? 
they might be , 
but not at the human factors level .
well , i heard it on the news today , 
i could swear it was i b m . 
as a matter of fact , the i b m just hired one more human factors person . 
if they'd just waited a little bit longer it could have been 
how much longer do you have ? 
and get that done this summer ? 
uh , i'm going to start this summer . 
ooh . *[[listen
 but , uh , i'm trying to get a , uh , intern position with i b m right now so that i can find an area to do my dissertation in . 
because you , 
it's hard finding an area to do a dissertation in this field . 
there has been so much work done already ? 
that it's limited application in some respects . 
um , in the area that we're in here , there's a lot of places that use human factors people . 
hi , uh , 
as a matter of fact this past weekend , since we had a long weekend , i , uh , took on a painting project in my bathroom 
and i had wallpaper up , 
i had to completely strip the wallpaper off and then spackle holes and then paint that 
and it took me all weekend 
because , uh , the wallpaper , getting it off , i had to wet the walls down 
and that had to dry . 
and then the spackling had to dry a day 
and then the painting took another day . 
you didn't try rewallpapering ? 
you just , uh , 
did you use a textured paint 
uh , no . 
so , i just used like a semigloss . 
well , did you get good results ? 
well , no , 
it looks so ,
i need to , uh , either paper back over it or do something .
but it didn't cover it ? 
but uh , uh , it just didn't look as smooth as i wanted it to . 
 well , we did a , uh , 
we moved , oh , last august 
and we're getting a house , 
my house had this dark wood paneling at the end of the den 
and we decided , 
we went to ,  i've forgotten   , one of the paint stores 
and i forgotten what it was you put down , and then you can just paint right over the dark . 
after about , uh , half dozen coats it looks reasonable 
 but it kept , 
the dark 
it was , uh , just a real dark , uh , wood grain type paneling 
 and it was smooth 
we put this stuff on 
 and it supposedly textured it or did something to it 
dark behind it , it was really hard to cover 
and  , 
was it like a primer ? 
it was something like that , although , when we got through i wished we hadn't done it 
because you know , we were trying to make the house look nice to sell it 
and we were painting it and trying to uh , you know , make it , 
and it really was , you know , 
the advice they give you is , uh , 
the job was considerably tougher than we thought . 
uh , particularly when you try to , 
i was talking to somebody else who had a lot of wood panelling 
and , uh , they had gotten somebody to come in with an estimate 
and it seemed like it was a good sized den with a lot panelling 
and the people quoted thirty thousand dollars to paint it or something . 
oh , my goodness , 
that's an awful lot . 
have you tried getting outside estimates to see what it costs to have something painted ? 
that was one of the requirements from , you know , f h a 
and it was fairly reasonable . 
we have a brick house 
but all the trim 
if i remember right , it was like five hundred dollars . 
oh , that's quite reasonable . 
so that wasn't too bad . 
um , problem i , 
have you tried matching paint lately ? 
my wife , 
we built a shed over the  long way   , 
actually , it took , 
but i did finish it . 
but my wife went to the , uh , home depot , i think it was , uh , a copy , took a piece of brick 
 and she wanted to paint the shed 
it's a wooden shed , uh , 
and she took it 
and they've got this machine that matches the color of paint . 
and , uh , they got , 
 uh , and , in fact she put some right ba , 
she got , 
they mixed , uh , a gallon of it 
and , uh , it's just remarkable how close it will match the paint , uh , 
and it does it , uh , oh , electronically something , 
so , 
but it's electronic . 
uh , you put your sample under this thing 
and it looks at it uh , and determines the , 
and it's really remarkable . 
uh , the problem they had 
and then they wanted some gray to do the trim . 
um , that they could have taken a sample 
this is sherwin williams paint or something 
but anyway . it's remarkable . 
that's one of the problems though when you start painting to try to get the , you know , 
you want this to look like this 
and you want that to look like that 
but when you start getting into colors , 
have you had problems getting colors to match ? 
as a matter of fact , uh , what we've got ours painted now is kind of a light creamy color and uh , a blue 
and the blue , even two years later or so it doesn't match ,
it's the very same type of paint and everything , 
so you , 
so what's your , 
what's the solution then ? 
oh , i have no idea . 
oh , my .
you could go back and paint ,
i'll just do a little bit here and  a little there  .
although , the , uh , 
uh , it , 
we almost one day , 
we painted the house to , uh , 
we painted the whole inside 
and it had all this dark trim . 
we thought , uh , you know , 
we did the one wall but the other trim , 
i'm trying to think , 
i think we left most of it because it gets to be , uh , 
they don't do that in the newer houses now 
we don't , 
the  mold   ,
in a new house everything is white . 
that's what we're trying to get ours to look like . 
oh , good luck .
we wound up selling the house . 
actually , i don't know whether it made , 
actually it does , 
it's interesting that the white , um , makes the rooms look bigger . 
one of the , 
in our down stairs in our dining room we have a formal dining room , it has molding , uh , like picture frames , i don't know what you call that 
and my wife painted the insides of those dark blue . 
oh , i see . 
and , uh , it makes the room look remarkably smaller . 
huh . she painted the insides dark blue and then the trim ,
the trim ,
white . 
 but by , 
and she did that all the way around the room which makes it look very attractive , 
but it makes the room look smaller uh 
it explains why they have everything white 
but i , 
well , maybe , 
well , uh , what about the lighting ? 
did it make a big difference ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
 uh , it has 
the living room has four , uh , good size windows 
and , uh , well , of course , at night 
but with the , 
we have a soccer field 
and the lights shine right at our house . 
it's kind of , 
we didn't know that when we bought the house 
so that , uh , 
you get some , 
the color doesn't really matter because you have that light . 
and , well , the dark blue to about three feet 
and then above that we left it white 
so . anyway , it didn't , 
 i see  .
but the interesting thing is that paint we wound up having to go back and scrape some of that away 
it didn't , 
it kind of bled under the masking tape which , i guess , is probably the topic we're 
you have to do that very , very carefully . 
and it takes a long time , 
that's right . 
you can work yourself to death . 
no kidding . 
it's kind of frustrating . 
it is . 
a lot of work , 
well , i've got to go to a meeting . 
it's been good talking to you . 
nice talking to you . 
well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this  type  .
have you been talking to males ? 
this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female .
i was afraid we might get into an argument . 
well , uh , i guess uh , there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations ,
and uh , i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now ,
they may be going to school , or may have elderly parents , or you know all sorts of other things . 
it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore , the women are spreading themselves thinner ,
oh , i think so . 
i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days . 
sometimes , i think i am going crazy trying to do it 
do you work outside the home ? 
do you have children ? 
uh , yes . 
so they are not quite as much of a responsibility 
but they are still there , you know , 
oh sure . 
they still take time , 
you know , i still provide most of the things that go on around the house . 
so , uh , yeah 
and for a while i was going to school too , 
and it was tough . 
uh , i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel , you know , 
uh , i think sometimes other things suffer and tha , 
i think it's hard to find a balance there . 
but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all . 
you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things 
i have little children , four and one , 
and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home . 
uh , and when i happen to , you know be , 
i'm very active with , uh , other people with children my age 
and most of us do tend to stay home , 
but when i run into people that , you know , just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time , there's almost a , uh , friction between us . 
not people that are , you know , necessarily good friends ,
it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence . 
you know w , 
if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself . 
and if you don't then , sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time  ,
it's a tough one . 
i mean , i've done some of both . 
when my kids were real little , i was at home for a couple of different periods of time . 
oh , i think the longest was less than a year , 
but still at least i was able to spend , you know , those first months with them . 
but , uh , i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things . 
 you know , the money was the issue . 
but , uh , even now , i would like to not have to work in some ways . 
it's kind of pull and tug , 
on the other hand , i can't imagine just being at home , uh , although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue . 
uh , still , uh , there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having , you know , a job and all that goes with that . 
that's definitely true . 
in fact , i work out of my home . 
um , i'm an accountant , 
and i do taxes and bookkeeping 
and i , uh , 
it was , 
it's a way for me to stay home . 
and i mean , i still , unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night , 
for my family ,
that's a good deal . 
where do you think this is going in the future , 
i mean , do you think things are going to change , 
or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this ? 
well , i hope that they will change uh , 
 but i'm , 
i just , 
i know it's going to be a slow change . 
uh , i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner . 
i mean i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know . 
i know quite a few people who have decided to not have you know , both , uh , of the parents work . 
and yet , uh , i we , 
i hope to see employer based , you know , helping out .
what do you think , 
do you think we are ,
i don't , 
uh , and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the family things work . 
uh , but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers , you know . 
it's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are , 
i don't know if they want to completely give that up . 
it's a very personal thing . 
but , it would be nice if there could be an inbetween , a middle ground somewhere . 
i think it's hard though when you talk and raising children 
because i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground . 
i think uh , they need security 
and yet they , 
i don't know , 
from speaking from my children , they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that . 
uh , they want to know things are going to be a certain way . 
well , yeah , 
i think they like a routine of sorts . 
well , we will see . 
i'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society . 
well , yes , 
i like the fact that , you know , gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions , 
but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be . 
oh , yes , 
the numbers are still very skewed to say the least . 
well i enjoyed talking to you . 
you too ellen . 
all right , 
what do you usually wear to work ? .
well , uh , i am basically retired now . 
i was a member , 
i was in education and in administration , 
and i uh , because my work often took me into court , uh , never was one that got , uh , accustomed to wearing pants suits and pants to work . 
but that was just me . 
i know many people are very comfortable in the classroom and what have you wearing pants . 
uh , it , 
i guess i was just old enough not to , uh , be very comfortable in it . 
how about you ? 
well , i work at t i 
and they don't really have , uh , dress code , so to speak there . 
it's pretty lax about , um , you know , 
you can pretty much wear whatever you want to , 
and i wear anything from jeans , when i'm feeling really casual to , uh , suits and dresses when i'm meeting with a customer 
and when it's raining ,
 and when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters , or that type of thing . 
um , but it just really depends on the weather and my mood 
and then , you know , obviously when i'm doing anything that i'm in front of people , or making presentations , teaching , whatever .
and i think that does make a difference , 
because when you do have to be in front of people ,
what about the mini skirt ? 
there are a few people every now and then that wear those to work . 
there pretty strict about that , though . 
um , i've never worn , 
i just wouldn't , 
i mean even to , 
well jeans aren't exactly professional 
but , for some reason a mini skirt is , to me a little more unprofessional to wear to work than jeans 
maybe it's just because of the sexist views and everything 
but you just feel like showing too much le , 
i don't know , 
i wouldn't want to wear a mini skirt to work . 
i have seen a few people do it though , 
but they weren't overly shor , 
and they weren't overly revealing . 
they were pretty much in good taste , 
but , um , 
for me wouldn't want to do that . 
well there are mini skirts and there are mini skirts . 
there are some that are really short 
and then there are some that may be will come like four inches or five inches above the knee . 
that's what i've seen . 
and again it depends upon the size , the shape of the person ,
now , i also , uh , 
even though i retired from education , uh , i do modeling 
and i teach at a modeling agency here . 
two hour classes in wardrobe , we do discuss a great deal , the mini skirt and the types of clothes to wear on the job . 
uh , even though i may have them from sixth grade on up through , uh , grandmothers ,
and , uh , i always try to emphasize the , clothes that you wear should not necessarily be the greatest fad , 
because maybe those are not the clothes that are the most , uh , appealing to you , or the most , uh , complimentary to you . 
but , uh , the mini skirt many times will evoke comments you don't really want . 
uh , then you're in the situation where you're very unhappy . 
well i feel like too , on the job , when , you know , there's men around and some of the managers are men , you know , you don't want them looking at your legs necessarily . 
that's right . 
and , uh , to me i just wouldn't feel comfortable in that at work , 
but , uh , 
well , uh , i have to , uh , agree with that , even when they was very , very popular in the early sixties , 
uh , i , uh , uh , 
again maybe because i was at the school , there were still many teachers who wore mini skirts , 
uh , we had no regulation against it 
and a lot of the kids did of course , 
and it could be very embarrassing for the men teachers . 
because they were not that careful in how they handled themselves in those mini skirts . 
and so , i think , uh , uh , of course , now i go the other extreme , i do not like to see , in the corporate areas , uh , all the women dressed like men ,
uh , i don't like that , 
i don't , 
i think there should be individuality in dressing . 
even with the very tailored look of a suit , sometimes i like to have just a little something that's feminine . 
not , you know , 
you don't want to over do it but , just a little , a touch of it just to say , yes , i am a woman , 
but i can be professional too . 
to look professional . 
i think that you make of that what you wish 
and you can go the opposite direction and , uh , over do all the frills and laces and flounces and what have you , which don't belong at least in my opinion , in the work place , 
uh , but that 
you can have a classical look without a great deal of adornment and what have you and still be very feminine . 
because that was one thing i always fought against . 
i started out as a physical education teacher . 
so i was always fighting against the idea of looking tailored or manish , 
uh , and people would never , ever guess that i was phys ed 
 um , and that pleased me , 
uh , and so , then i , of course , just continued what i considered the best style of clothing for me at work 
even at home here now , i , i will wear blue jeans or i'll wear shorts and what have you , uh , and be very comfortable 
but when i go out somewhere , then , uh , unless i have a pair of dress slacks , i don't usually wear a lot of blue jeans . 
i have difficulty getting them to fit me comfortably any how . 
and , so , uh , uh , i just feel that , uh , you know each person has to dress to their own liking and for their own comfort . 
but , uh , there are certain norms that companies should be able to , uh , put out as guidelines for their employees . 
that's one thing i like about t i is that they aren't overly strict about what you wear 
and you know , your boss doesn't come up to you and say now remember , tomorrow you have a meeting so you'd better wear a suit . 
i mean , they leave it up to you and your judgment to , 
the only real restrictions they have are , uh , no halter tops and no shorts , even the long walking short of the squirts , the split skirts ,
that's good . 
and they don't allow , uh , any sweat shirts or t shirts that might have vulgar , or , you know , anything like that on it , 
and i think that's good because it does allow people to be individual 
and it allows you to kind of dress the way you feel that day . 
or , you know , if you want to be comfortable and casual you can , 
and , you know , like when i'm writing training material , i prefer to be more comfortable unless i know i have to meet with a customer later during the day . 
so , i think , that is good that they're like that . 
i do know there's a lot of companies that are very strict about what the employees wear 
and they must wear blue or gray or black and a white shirt and ,
and i don't quite agree with that . 
well , i don't either . 
fortunately i don't have to work in those companies .
but , uh , i , uh , did have a group come over from one of the banks , over the children's hospital where i was volunteering 
and , uh , they were doing a presentation 
and every one of the young execs coming up were dressed exactly a like , men and women . 
they all had on the gray jackets and the gray trousers or skirts and the white blouses and the same color tie . 
uh , right . 
 uh , and i think that's sad because that doesn't allow for any individuality . 
that uh , can stifle creativity . 
i agree . 
well , it , 
well it's been nice talking with you . 
nice talking to you too , 
i enjoyed it . 
bye , bye . 
bye , bye . 
what have you seen ? 
the latest movie i've seen that i thought was fantastic was dances with wolves . 
i knew you were going to say that . 
i want 
 oh , man . 
i just finally ended up going to see it , uh , 
and one day my husband had the kids 
and i just went because we could never get to go see it together because it's so long . 
by the time we had a babysitter for that long . 
so i finally just went to see it . 
and i just thought it was fantastic . 
i watched , uh , costner on the academy awards . 
i was really happy that he got , 
i was hoping he was going to get best actor . 
 uh , but he did pretty good on that one . 
that was quite a , 
the buffalo scene in that thing 
it's like , 
i mean it just 
i bet . 
there're several of them that are out right now that i want to see . 
uh , i'm afraid to go see that one . 
that one looks so scary just , 
i thought gosh 
it's supposed to 
that's what people said , 
i know some friends who went to see it . 
they said it was really riveting . 
well , you know , that's what they said about the exorcist , you know . 
it's terrible . 
you'll have nightmares , you know . 
i watched last weekend . 
me and my roommate . 
we laughed about it .
 well , you're not a thirteen year old . 
i don't know . 
i saw it when i was a kid 
 well , i'll tell , 
well i guess it was because i'd read the book before i saw the movie . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and the book , to me , was far more frightening than the movie was . 
oh , really . 
 huh . gosh . 
he's a very good writer 
and he had a way of putting you in that scene , you know . 
it was , 
 oh , boy . 
and , of course , i was living alone at the time 
and it was late at night and scary and , you know .
you start hearing noises 
call the crisis line . 
i bet . 
and there's rats in the attic , you know . 
oh , gosh . 
uh , let's see . 
there was a couple of others that are out , 
and i can't remember , 
i saw one i thought was crummy . 
with that new , uh , michael j fox movie , the hard way . 
where he plays a actor that's , uh , like th , huh . 
i didn't even like the previews on that . 
oh , i know . 
it was , 
well i ended up at the theater 
and there didn't seem to be anything else on i wanted to see , 
so i'll try that . 
but it wasn't worth anything . 
i didn't care 
i don't much care for michael j fox anyway . 
well , the last two i saw him in , one of those back to the future , part three deals 
and that was crummy also . 
i saw the original back to the future 
and then i know , 
i hardly ever go see a sequel . 
i mean , i think the only i've ever seen a sequel was two thousand and one . 
oh , boy . 
uh , two thousand and ten was far better . 
two thousand and one was a good movie if you had read the book . 
well , i hadn't read it 
and i couldn't figure what was going on half the time , 
nobody could figure it out . 
 i mean 
there's just things , 
all you can do is put it in words . 
you can't put it in pictures . 
you know , what's the significance of the apes , you know .
i should probably go back and read the book now that i just saw the movie again not too long ago . 
 oh , the book is really good . 
 i mean , i keep a little library of books that i just like to read over and over again 
and that's one of them . 
wow . huh . 
it's so well written . 
huh . well , i have one i bet you haven't seen if you don't have kids . otis and milo . 
oh , you're right . 
i haven't .
 oh , that is the most precious movie . 
it has , to see it on the big screen because it's just the most gorgeous nature scenes you've ever seen in your life . 
and it's all this , 
it's the story of this little cat and dog 
and it's not like cutesy . 
uh , it's just so realistic . everything they do . 
you wonder how in the world they ever got them to do some of these things . 
huh . oh , those 
 and it was , 
a real dog and cat ? 
and all the other animals . 
they initially start out in the barnyard kind of setting where they're raised . 
and then the cat gets , um , on this treacherous journey . 
he climbs into a box and ends up floating down this river 
and he winds up all over creation . 
i don't know where in the world it is . 
somewhere in china somewhere i think that it was filmed . 
but , uh , it's just really an incredible thing . 
sounds sort of like the incredible journey . 
it was pretty wild 
and   . f course , the only sound is dudley moore narrates it . 
but there's you know , nothing else to keep it going . 
but it really keeps 
i've seen it twice now .
that sounds a lot like a walt disney film . 
sounds a lot a like a walt disney film . 
it was like the best of the walt disney ones . 
walt disney's kind of gotten worse in my opinion over the past few years . 
 oh , yeah . 
not anymore . 
i mean , i was raised on walt disney films . you know . 
old yeller . uh , big red . 
all those old good ones that you , you know , wish they had on 
when i was a little kid , i saw the incredible journey on christmas eve 
 oh , boy . 
 i mean 
 that's pretty good . 
and that was something for greedy old me at christmas time , i'll tell you . 
 let's see . 
what are some other ones i've seen lately . 
i'm trying to remember . 
i can't . 
oh , i just saw one on the video . 
oh , um , have you seen the gods must be crazy , part two ? 
that is a riot . 
is it ? 
the first one was really good . 
but the second one  , 
i was really surprised . 
i didn't much care for the first one . 
maybe that's , 
i thought it was funny . 
but , that's my sense of humor .
it's hard to find movies that aren't terrible violent or terribly bunch of sex going on anymore . 
and i guess i'm just middle america or something . 
i just go to be entertained 
i just . 
i get so tired of , you know , these , you know , sequels . 
number nine , number ten , number 
freddy's revenge part twentyfive or whatever . 
yeah , you know . 
i've never , 
freddy eats a nuclear warhead , you know . 
i'm just , 
i'm so sick and tired of that . 
i just can't believe it . 
it's like rocky films . 
i've never seen any of those . 
i can't stand stallone . 
i can't either . 
he seems so macho i just .
and i was afraid that rambo was going to do the same thing that rocky was going to do , you know . 
now i hardly ever watch t v . 
if i ever get the hankering to see something , i've got , i don't know , maybe about thirty or forty movies 
and i just , 
when they're so cheap too at the video stores that you can . 
i don't even rent them . you know . 
you don't ? 
i figure if i find a movie i like , i'll buy it . 
cause i just watch them over and over again . 
that's like , 
my husband does that . 
he can watch 
and i'm , 
there's very few i would want to see that many times . 
so once he has one he likes , he likes to watch it over and over . 
my very favorite one that the top of the tick for me is , uh , excalibur . 
oh , yeah . 
that was a good one . 
i haven't seen that one in a long time . 
i loved that film . um , 
it's just so well done . 
 and i lived over in england for four years , 
 oh , boy . 
that was the first place i ever saw it . 
and it was just , gosh , 
it was so good . 
oh , gosh . 
it was filmed in ireland . 
and they got pretty scenery in ireland . 
i bet .
it's nice . 
and i've been down to the south of england where supposedly king arthur's castle was . 
oh , boy . 
so , that really has a lot of meaning for you to see that . 
yeah it was unimpressive to look at . 
i mean , the whole thing was about the size of a medium house .
it wasn't , 
well , when i was in england years ago . 
and i went to like shakespeare's and , you know , stratfordonavon 
 oh , yeah . 
and it was like you couldn't stand up inside of it 
because it was so 
the ceilings 
but . eah . 
there's some nice stuff over there to see . 
i spent four years traveling around and didn't see , you know , hardly anything . 
i just , 
 oh , boy . 
i need ,
stonehenge , of course , you know . 
everybody makes the obligatory trip to stonehenge . 
big deal . 
here's some rocks sitting out in the middle of a field . 
it's boring . 
i remember i went to see don quixote over there when it came out . 
it came out right around the time , with sophia loren 
and that was a riot to see that . 
come to think of it , i don't think i went to the movies one time . 
cause when you're touristing , you probably don't want to take the time to go see a movie . 
i , uh , 
where i lived . uh , it was a little town called newmarket .
oh , boy .
and there was another town called barry saint edmunds about twenty miles away from us . 
and they had a little , uh , theater company there 
and we use to go out to that about once a week . 
oh , boy . 
a really nice place . 
you know , amateurs but really quite good . 
uh , but that was interesting . 
that sounds great . 
uh , but other than that i just didn't have time to go to the movies , you know . 
never sho , anyway , anything that i ever wanted , 
i rented a lot of videos .
cause the closest movie theater was barry saint edmunds 
and who wants 
 oh , boy . 
a lot of people did . 
but it would have to be a good show . 
it's hard to know what the good movies are anymore . 
because sometimes the reviews you just can't go by . 
 i us , 
they have all these neat phrases .
that's what they when the thing hasn't won any award . *[[listen
oh , i see .
you know . they can't , 
it's kind of like waterfront property or something 
from love canal .
water view .
waterfront property here at love canal , you know . 
but , you know , critically acclaimed . 
that's wh , 
i mean , there's a lot of reasons why i don't go to movies . 
and primarily , i mean , going to upset you . 
but people who bring kids irritates the heck out of me .
we're energized . 
i'm in the middle of , um , going out for bids to have my house painted . 
uh , painting is not hard to do , uh , 
and our house is not 
but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap 
and it's just a hassle to go through it 
so i'm looking for the easy way out . 
uh , i know . 
is easy to find uh , painters to do this for you ? 
it's easier to find painters , 
but a good two coats , and are they ,
exterior , 
uh , interior's not so bad because it's more fun , 
it's more , c , 
but yeah , 
outside you have high peeks ,
it can be a real issue . 
well , when we've painted , um , 
right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there , 
it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles ,
so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted . 
um , but , it , 
the problem is that the sun hits it . 
so preparing is a real problem , 
you've got to prepare it well 
or else it will flake . 
here they , 
some of the home builders are , 
they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money 
so they put up , uh , a quarter inch masonite , basically , 
and they painted it kind of like a  spun   of a sorts  
so it's real cheap . 
and , uh , uh , i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and as low as five hundred and forty dollars 
so it's ,
oh , there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap 
and i'm so much worried about that as what ,
which might be a bigger problem than it would be , uh , 
oh , sure . 
so y'all , you haven't had recently   .
we painted the bedroom , uh , well within the last couple of months , 
that's fun . 
and we have some more that need to be done , 
but we've owned this house almost five years now , 
and , um , when we bought it um , it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired ,   
but the daughter was a real estate agent 
and she was selling it 
and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house . 
so she told us that the house had been , uh , professionally painted recently . 
and it looked pretty good , you know , uh , the interior walls all basically white , 
but they obviously had been done without to much , uh , wear afterward . 
the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on uh , the door frames , 
when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it . 
uh , that's not very , 
big long strips . 
so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly . 
and some of still has to be redone . 
oh , they just painted over varnished wood . 
oh , my , 
well , no 
actually it had been a repaint job . 
but they had not , 
either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top 
or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever 
because it was woodwork 
so it looked as if it had been painted ,
but , um , it had not , 
either that or it had not been prepared underneath 
and it was greasy or something , 
it comes off in strips , i mean not even little bit . 
so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time , 
oh , no . 
we know what a job it's going to be 
because you almost have to strip the whole thing ,
i wish you good luck . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
so , how do you feel about our policy in latin america ? .
oh , i'm all in favor of it , 
you know , of the financial dependence that most of the countries have on us , you know , uh , 
i mean we could direct the government even more than we have been . 
i don't think we've been doing too bad . 
well , do you think that's right ? 
do you think ,
well , i think the drug industry can , uh , bring so much money to a country . 
i think that if it wasn't for the united states government matching that the drug , uh , cartels or whatever would control most the central and latin america . 
just that , uh , money is power , 
and , uh , 
well , i have a friend 
his descendants are from , uh , uh , nicaragua and , uh , very , 
i mean it's like his ,
and , uh , he , you know , 
i just  get sorry  feelings for people that their family came from there and how they feel about , you know , our intervention and their government and stuff like that , 
and he was all for it because it's just like you say , uh , 
there's so many people there that get the kind of control that's bad , you know , 
and that their governments can become so corrupt 
and it's like , well , you know , i use to feel like , 
well , they , should work their way , you know , 
they should be able to work their self out of it 
or , you know , why intervene in another country's , you know , problems and things like that . 
why should we be the ones that have to do it and things like that 
but i think just a lot of times if we don't then that influence will affect our country too for one . 
and for two , you know , that it does help . 
i mean , you know , i think the people in those country do want our help . the people that are under conditions that are , you know , not favorable to their rights . 
but , uh , 
but , uh , i wish we didn't have to . 
i mean i'd rather , 
even if a country chooses a government that's not , you know , exactly the kind of government that we have , you know that makes since , so to speak , you know , 
it is a government that stays in power , that can stay in power , 
but it seems like most of them don't  ,
well , sometimes that's america doing that too 
oh , yeah . 
we fall out of , uh , agreements with certain leaders 
and then amazingly enough the country starts turning against our leader , you know .
it's , uh , 
so you think like c i a influence and our money over there . 
 uh , that and , 
i think that has a lot of things to did with , uh , um , 
well , then the toppling of those kinds of governments , you know , like , 
that was , uh , 
i mean , 
i'm really wondering whether that's going it settle down or not , 
because on one hand you have , you know , that you know , the , soviet government , of course , mistreating a lot of the , uh , slovak countries and then ,
they were feeding us , you know , 
so , uh 
but we're not intervening in that , 
or do you think that we are to the degree that we are causing .
i think we're getting quite a , 
put it this way , i think , 
i think the people are ,
and we're , uh , 
see , i , 
that communication has ,
 you know , uh , this is ridiculous 
we're living , with these kind of conditions in a world that's advancing as fast as it is 
that , uh , 
i think ,
well , i mean , i don't mean to , 
well , i guess i do in a way , 
sometimes i think a religion has a lot to do with that . 
i think you know , where such catholic influence . 
and i think the catholic religion itself was such a dominant factor , as far as keeping the people down ,
i thought ,
they were always having to meet in the catacombs and all this , 
so all the persecution that they're sort of use to it , it's been ,
 see , but i don't agree with that because the catholic religion , as far as through the ages has been the rule , so to speak . 
you know , they are the ones that set a lot of the rules 
and they are the ones that do keep the people down , 
i mean when you a religion that most of the people go to church and they don't understand when anything is being said yet they're expected to bow down to it , i think that keeps people in sort of line , you know . 
i don't quite understand that . 
do they even understand what's being said ? 
well , when it use to be latin . 
i'm just saying ,
oh , yeah , 
the old church . 
which it's not that way now 
but i think that it's just latin countries are slower in coming around . 
well , they actually understood , 
it is in america where it was hard 
latin , you know 
uh , they still didn't understand it though , i don't think , 
because i descend from that . 
and i don't understand latin 
 and i'm of spanish descent . 
so  ,
they tend to be more , 
like not stand up for their rights as much . 
they're not really sure of what they are . i don't think . 
uh , i never really thought of ,
well , i mean , how ,
i mean , why are they not as vocal 
or why do they not , you know , stand up , so to speak , for their rights ? 
i don't know , 
could be the , 
you know , the , 
the poverty level is certainly , uh , you know , much worse in the latin american countries . 
i mean , you can say that about africa too . 
i think it has something to do with the poverty level because africa is certainly not a catholic , uh , country , 
and yet , you know , they have the same problem where , you know , 
uh , i don't ,
i don't agree , 
because i think that they are pretty vocal about it in , uh , africa . 
i think they've made a lot more chances . 
 their very vocal . 
well , in south africa , 
in south africa i think they are , 
but yet , you know , 
so , what's the difference ? 
idi amin was , you know , in power for so long . 
uh , racial , i think  , 
or like you say , maybe communication of knowing that , hey , up in other english colonies , or previous english colonies , everything is equal and yet down there it's not , 
you know , i think communication does have a lot to do with it , you know , in education ,
i don't know about education 
because the black community is still not very educated down there . 
so , i think it is communication , 
it's just oopsy . 
i think it maybe has a lot to do with education 
because you look at the , uh , european countries , 
i think they tend to be more educated , much more ,
that's true . 
you know that , 
i don't know whether , uh , 
actually how the education system works in the russian countries ,
well , i know that russia , better educated than we are ,
that's good , .
you know , uh , something we compete with . 
uh , and i've been sort of disappointed how that they say literacy rate has gone down , you know , 
that's sort of upsetting ,
in our country ? 
that is really upsetting 
 and , considering it's free , you know , 
i mean good education is really still free . 
well , that's just it though , good education . 
is it good education ? 
it may be free but is it good education 
are we willing to pay for it ,
i mean a lot of people bitch and moan about the taxes and all 
but , so are they willing to ,
yet people get very frightened when they see the japanese moving in and the russians moving in certain areas of technology , you know , that we use to dominate 
and it's like well , you know , they're educating their people to higher degrees than we do . 
so , you're going to have to expect it . 
so what you , 
are you willing to compromise a little take some of that money out of your pocket and pay for good quality education . 
so , i don't know . 
but , i , 
so , who is your favorite football team ? 
well , i would say the saints  ,
you got it . 
what's that ? 
they're going to go somewhere pretty shortly . 
i think they are because they're getting better every year . 
and , uh , they ,
i don't think so . 
we went to the playoffs . 
well , i'm a buffalo bills fan .
now i like them , too . 
so , it's good to see the bills doing so well now 
they are . 
they are doing a whole bunch better . 
what's that ? 
 uh , jim kelly . 
i like to watch them , too . 
they're the , 
i like to watch almost all the football 
but , um , of course , i watch every saints game that i can watch . 
but i think they're really going to do good because it seems like they're finally all coming together . 
if they would just quit blowing it . 
well , the , 
the n f l draft really seems to be doing its job 
because , got teams certainly weren't a powerhouse , uh , ten years ago . 
now , they've been able to get some good players and come around 
and th , 
new orleans the same story 
and , uh , a few years ago denver was a powerhouse 
and then uh , they weren't getting the draft picks 
and now the , uh , other team , 
so it seems to be , uh , moving around and , uh , to new orleans' benefit , 
and , uh , you see how , 
look at the cowboys now .
really bad . 
but they got so much bad publicity , too . 
and i think that hurt a lot of , you know , 
well , yeah . 
uh , firing tom landry and hiring jimmy johnson 
what kind of , uh , uh , 
doesn't give you much respect for their team at all . 
where the owner would fire tom landry , you know , is like one of the greatest coaches of all time . 
and just because they had a couple of bad seasons . 
and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching . 
because all the problems , 
i mean , if you think about those years that we had the losing season , of how bad , 
i mean his players were constantly getting kicked off the team because of drugs , because of ,
and , i mean , it was just one thing it seemed like right after the other ,
and he alway , 
and , uh , had a lot of trouble with injuries , too . 
you know , he'd , uh , never seem to be able to keep his guys healthy . 
and then even like , uh , what is it , eric dickerson left ,
you're right . 
you know , like people were jumping ship right and left . 
and , i don't know , 
that sounds to me more like the front office problem than coaching problem , 
but then the team was sold . 
but , uh , that jimmy johnson came in , too , though , 
and he just , you know , 
when he bought the team and all it just seemed like he just decided , you know , this is the way it's going to be 
and it was bad . 
i mean , it really was . 
to me it was like it's going to take them quite a while to rebuild 
because i mean anything that tom landry wanted or had , he was going to change it . 
i mean it's , 
i mean , you know , that's the way i felt about it . 
if new orleans ever gets a quarterback 
there ain't nobody going to beat us then . 
because look how good we did without a quarterback this year .
i know . 
who was the quarterback ? 
see , i can't even think of who the new orleans quarterback ,
fourcade was for a while . 
and then , um , i can't remember that guy's name , the one that held out for the money 
and he was across the river .
uh , i can't think of his name now , 
but really we didn't have a quarterback . 
we had one guy that couldn't throw 
and we had one guy that couldn't run . 
and , it was just bedlam . 
we really didn't have a quarterback . 
it was , uh , defense won all the games . 
were they able to draft anybody this year ? 
i don't know 
because , you know , they gave away a lot of their drafts .
so , i don't know . 
i hadn't heard , you know , whether they have a new one or not . 
well , when is the ,
but , uh , 
has the n f l draft even gone yet ? 
but , i mean , i don't know whether they have one of the first , you know , 
that would be real good . 
well , they've , 
i mean , ye , 
everybody gets in draft . 
but , i don't know whether they'll be far enough up where they can do any good . 
but , uh , 
or even making the playoffs 
so that doesn't help you in the draft . 
but we ,
that's all there is to it . 
but , the players and stuff , they finally quit giving away the really good players and started keeping them too . 
because we had some , 
you remember when archie manning was a quarterback ? 
well , he was good . 
but every time we'd get a real good player they'd treat him bad . 
and , of course , we had a different coach then , too . 
but they'd treat him bad 
and it was weird . 
but , um , this year they had all good players except for the quarterback . 
the quarterback , all of them , every one that they played , 
i think they played , uh , 
i can't remember whether we played three or four quarterbacks , 
but all of them were bad . 
i mean , they were terrible . 
they could not pitch . 
you know , they couldn't even take handoffs . 
it was ,
but , uh , 
oh , that's one , 
did you get to watch any of their games ? 
now he's the number one rated quarterback in the n f l . i think , 
i'm pretty sure he was this past season . 
and , uh , then with , uh , uh , the defense , with bruce smith there at linebacker there , they've got a very well rounded team 
and it seems that they've gotten over their bickering and their fighting as problems they had in the past 
and now they're , uh , really playing good together as a team . 
um . do you watch it every sunday ? 
 uh , when i can . 
i'm a musician 
and , uh , the band i play in , uh , i , 
this is just something on the side 
and , uh , the band i play in , we tend to rehearse quite a bit on sundays . 
so i missed a lot of sundays during 
did you ever get to watch any of the , uh , new orleans games ? 
i'd have to confess i don't really scope out the new orleans games , per se . 
new orleans just isn't one of the areas , 
i've lived in so many places . 
i've lived in , uh , denver 
but i don't like the broncos . 
i was born in buffalo 
and i lived uh , outside of boston for five years 
and then my family lives in philadelphia now 
 uh , so i tend to look for , uh , uh , 
teams in your area . 
and i lived in detroit , too . 
so i like , uh , 
first of all , first and foremost the bills games i want to see . 
and then i'll , uh , normally check out the eagles or the patriots 
and , patriots were so depressing this last year that 
i know it .
but , uh , first and foremost the bills . 
i even wen , 
i got to go to a bills game this year , which was fun . 
it was the bills , eagles game , which appropriately enough 
that's neat . 
and it was good weather . 
oh , my goodness . 
so , we couldn't a done much better than that in buffalo .
because usually it's snowing .
ice and rain and everything . 
if you get to watch some of these , 
now i don't know how it will be this year , you know , 
but , i mean , these games go right down to the wire . 
it was like i was sitting on the edge of my chair , you know , going oh , no , no . 
and one , uh , 
i can't remember . 
it was about , uh , 
it was right close to when we was going to find out if we was going to get to be in the playoffs ,
so , we're watching the game . 
all right . 
the other team got the ball 
and like , no , we got the ball back . 
that's the way it was . 
and they had to kick . uh , to know whether we were going to win the game or lose a game because they got one point ahead of us . 
so we had to sit there , you know , 
and they cut the show off and started showing us another football game . 
we did not get to see the end of the game . 
you talk about people calling in . 
oh , my gosh . 
it was wild . 
i mean , here everybody is sitting on the edge of their chair ,
and then they changed the game . 
and they changed it and gave us another game in the middle of another , you know , one that was going on . 
cut us off right there the last few seconds . 
the station finally , you know how they'll put the little message down at the bottom . 
 because it was funny . 
i mean everybody was furious . 
i was so mad i got up and went and called , you know , 
i couldn't believe that . 
but , almost down to the end , 
we would be ahead , you know , 
but then in the fourth quarter they'd let them get up there either with them or , you know , right ahead of them . 
and it'd come right down to the end 
and either we made it or we didn't . 
oh , and it was something else . 
if we had a quarterback this year we would have went to the super bowl . 
there's no question about it , because everybody was playing good together except the quarterbacks . 
and the quarterbacks just didn't do anything . 
well ,   that's the guy that counts .
but , maybe we'll get your guy . 
oh , i , 
um , so do you have a personal computer ? 
 uh , well we do have one in our home , uh , 
it's on the fritz right now , because the monitor isn't working properly 
however , um , you know , the bane of our existence these days , 
reports and papers and that sort of thing . 
that's what , 
and i haven't used it since i got out of college , 
and that was six years ago , 
oh , wow . 
but it was my sister's who , 
my sister bought it 
 and , uh , my father had a small business 
and she thought that he would incorporate it and use it in the business , 
and he never did , 
he always did everything out by hand . 
he only had three employees , 
oh , yeah . 
so , you know , it wasn't really worth it to him to do it . 
like pay , the payroll 
and there are ,
basically payroll . 
what kind do you have ? 
um , it's an i b m , 
i think it's a professional three hundred , 
that's the digital one . 
it's an , uh , i b m p c junior , i think . 
oh , well , that's a nice computer . 
uh , she uses it now , uh , my sister , to , 
actually , she moved 
so she took it with her .
she just finished up her bachelor's degree 
 so i don't know if she's going to even use it anymore . 
oh , well , well , encourage her to try other things , 
because , um , i am , uh , 
i work in a school system , 
and i teach writing 
and you know , because students really do seem to be freer when they write on the computer , as you probably found out yourself , 
 but , um , i also am sponsoring a literary magazine , 
and we're doing our entire layout on the computer  , uh , because of the graphics program and a page maker program that we have ,
oh , yeah , 
that's neat , 
so , it is wonderful , 
once you get into some of the programs that are out now , you can do so much with them ,
well , i know there's got to be a lot of uses , 
but it's just you have ,
you have to make yourself do it , 
but you have to have a need . 
i really have no need for it at all , 
 um , i work for digital equipment 
 and we have a powerful computer down at work . 
so , you don't need a personal one  ? 
and i , 
they're great for playing games . 
my brother , 
 well , my son is , uh , studying electronic technology , 
and he's been able to do things um , reports , and his learning and all because he can lay things out that way . 
um , and i guess it , 
if you're doing that sort of thing it's really useful , 
but , um , unless it is , i guess it's kind of a waste . 
i know some people 
they just went through a course , uh , and took the electronic grafting course ,
oh , that's ,
the c a d . 
i knew what you meant , 
and that's really neat , 
i mean , yeah , 
you can do graphs on it too , 
but you know , this is one step above it , 
but it's actual , um , drafting , 
and i always , 
you can do wonderful design . 
well , especially when 
you have to be so precise . 
and the computer does it all for you . 
 so it was really neat . 
i wanted to go to that course , 
but my boss wouldn't pay for it , 
oh , well .
i'll be needed . 
because , um , i didn't want to go do it myself 
because i didn't think i was really going to use it . 
  i got  this cough , 
i've got a cold because it was eighty degrees up here and i went outside with no coat on . 
it was bad . 
what a change , huh ? 
you couldn't really wear a coat because it was so hot , 
and then , again , i picked up a cold . 
 but i'm doing all right , getting over it . 
well , that's good . 
so i don't even know how much , um , personal computers cost nowadays . 
 well , they vary tremendously . 
um , because you can get 
because they're , uh , 
the ones that were made a few years ago , um , 
 i've seen them for five , and six hundred dollars , 
but they um , have much less memory , and capable ,
they can't do um , 
you can't do very much on them . 
um , well , it's just that uh , you have to be able to get your program in , 
they take up so much space that you don't have any place then to work . 
you don't have any ,
but , um , you want to go into one that's really useful , you're going to have to go over a thousand dollars , 
and even for a personal computer it's probably smart to spend that much , 
 and we've , 
ours is not quite that powerful , 
and so , you know , we are limited ,
you do run in , 
oh , yeah , 
oh , wow . 
some things we can't do , 
 but then we haven't needed to either ,
but we've been able to do what we can . 
wow , that's neat that you even reach the limits of yours . 
i haven't even begun to reach the limits , 
but i , 
mine is not as good as a p c , uh , 
ours is a commodore one twentyeight . 
 and um , as useful , not quite as powerful . 
they did , 
that's very true , 
they did . 
very competitive . 
i don't even know much money my sister spent on hers , 
but it's going to be a waste , 
she's not going to do it ,
 oh , well . 
sounds that you were right .
well , she likes it , 
she gets to write her reports , 
and she could have bought a typewriter also .
a typewriter with memory would have been fine , 
it's all she uses it for . 
um , i think it might have a spelling editor on it , 
i'm not sure . 
it prob , 
if it doesn't she could easily put it on . 
that's the one great thing about it .
which program did you use ? 
did you use word perfect ? 
um , no , 
i really don't , 
it was six years ago . 
oh , yeah . 
she pretty much set it up . 
she goes , here , you make your file , and then you can , uh , edit it . 
um , i used the one at work a lot , um , 
matter of fact , anything i've had to write from now on , 
write a couple of resumes , *[[listen to this and the previous two uttssame or separate ?
and i was just great , 
and all you have to do is just put it in spelling check mode , 
and i don't even have to look my words up anymore . 
they're great , 
you're right .
i need to go help my daughter do something , 
good luck . 
well , bye . 
uh , byebye . 
well , do you think , uh , 
i mean i wonder , 
the assumption is that it is a problem , uh , 
and i've never actually had too many people explain to me why it's a problem , though i have the same instinctual feeling that it's a problem 
 uh , but it's not clear to me that it is . 
uh , bo , 
um , it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically , or in terms of their opinions . 
but if those who don't vote , if you made them vote 
and , it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way , you know , in other words if forty percent had voted for that person and sixty percent for the other , just like everyone who did vote , it's not clear to me that it is really a problem , um . 
um , that's interesting , 
because i had thought , 
i feel that it's a problem also , 
but , i see your point on that . 
i mean , i assume that those who don't vote , 
i mean if you look at the break down of those who don't vote , they tend to be , you know , 
poor blacks , for example , vote very little , and things like that 
and i assume that they would vote differently if they were voting , than your average voter . 
but i don't know if that's the case . 
in fact i've heard of studies that suggest that that isn't . 
apparently they don't think it's a problem .
i vote religiously , 
i really do . 
um , i guess i'm a fan of democracy 
and , uh , wish i could vote on more things frankly . 
that's right , um , 
but it's funny because here in california things are getting , uh , increasingly democratically oriented , in the sense of people being able to vote for things . 
i mean , we have these state initiatives now . 
the first really you know wide spread one was , uh , proposition thirteen which was a , uh , tax revolt ,
i r , 
uh , and , you know , now we're , 
and that was whatever , ten years ago 
and now we're up to proposition a hundred and fifty or something like that . 
i mean , we've just , 
there were apparently voters who just threw up their hands after the last voters pamphlet because they were being asked to make decisions on topics that would have three different competing proposals 
and you had to vote for , you know , yes or no on each of them 
and no one could make heads or tails out of some of them 
and it was incredibly complicated and difficult . 
and a lot of people revolted against that , 
 you know , to make these decisions for us . 
i kind of feel the opposite , though . 
i wish we were given an opportunity to vote on more things . 
i do t , 
i think our elected officials say they are speaking for us 
but they're not speaking for me . 
i wouldn't mind having , oh , more votes than i get to have , frankly .
that's true . 
anyone who doesn't vote , it's fine with me as long as i can have their vote . 
that would make me happy though . 
maybe not in a deep philosophical sense , but in a selfish sense , it probably would . 
i don't know , 
it's interesting , uh , some countries voting is obligatory . 
 uh , it is in australia , for example . 
is that true ? 
i didn't know that , 
i was think , 
that is one solution to it . 
i don't know how i feel about that . 
 but i don't , 
that's not really democratic . not what i'd consider truly democratic . 
well australia considers itself every bit as much a democracy as the united states . 
 and it's not for me to say that they're not . 
um , they feel , 
i mean here you have the right to vote 
and they simply define it as a duty there . 
you know , a duty to pay taxes , you know , 
is that democratic ? 
i mean , we don't have the right to pay taxes in this country , 
we have the duty to pay taxes . 
it's a duty , right . 
 and in that country it's a duty to pay taxes 
and it's a duty to vote on how those taxes are spent . 
and it's not clear to me that , that's so much less democratic . 
but part of me rebels against that , 
 but then i'm an american . 
and some people don't vote , 
i mean there is 
like three or four percent of australians don't vote 
and i think they're eligible for a fine . 
i don't know if they actually are fined or what happens , 
but you're eligible for some sort of fine if you don't vote . 
that's interesting . 
i have people here that i know that have never registered to vote . 
i was sort of , s , 
i told them if they don't vote they don't have the right to criticize . 
well i , 
that's how i feel . 
i mean , you least tried 
and you can say something 
but if you don't vote , part of me , and it's kind of a nasty part of me feels like , well if you didn't vote , you get what's coming to you , you know . 
that's right , 
i feel th , 
 and certainly that's true in the overall , 
i mean no one individual that's true for but for the population as a whole , 
i sort of feel that way .  , they don't vote for someone because they don't like any of them and then the person gets in and they don't like him and he turns out to have been worse than her that they might have voted for , or something like that . *[[listen: two utts ?
and , you know , i say well , you know , voting for the lesser of two evils is still important . 
i think it is too . 
sometimes it is a difficult choice . 
you don't feel as though you have much of a choice , 
i mean , it's funny because technically you do . 
i mean you have the right to do a write in candidate . 
but of course that's not really a vote . 
it doesn't really gain anything . 
it really doesn't , 
and so it's a complicated situation , 
but i would like to see , 
i don't know , 
i'm thinking of actually moving to australia 
is that goin , 
 i mean , i mean i'm not thinking of moving there because of the voting ,
not be , 
oh , i see . 
and , uh , i , 
are you a t i employee , i'm interested . 
not , 
i just wondered . 
quite curious , how that would work , to have both , i mean , you know , 
and i believe in a certain , uh , 
soviet bloc countries you are obliged to vote too . 
in fact , it was even pretty much spelled out who you did vote for , up until fairly recently 
and , that's what i think of when i think of you're obliged to vote . 
but when you actually , really are given as much choice as you are in this country , with its two party system , um , 
i don't know , 
i kind of , 
part of me is wary 
and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty , um . 
well , uh , maybe they should , 
perhaps that would be a solution if they were required to vote at least for their first three or four years after they become of voting age .
and perhaps they would be indoctrinated that this is their duty . 
well that's a thought , 
or certain privileges come from voting which aren't that important but are nice to have , 
i don't know . 
the right to write your , 
maybe it should go with a driver's license .
not a , 
that's considered a privilege , not a right . 
that is a privilege , 
but technically most people , 
technically it's a privilege , 
but most people think of it as a right . 
i mean , in other words if the government denies you a driver's license , people get very upset . 
but actually it's a privilege ,
it is . 
that's correct . 
and , fortunately voting isn't that . 
maybe it should be . 
well except if you're a felon , 
if you're a felon it is taken away from you . 
i mean ,   they will take away your right to vote , under certain circumstances . 
that's right . 
um , so , gosh , 
don't have a great 
 but uh , republic documents , uh , when they were arguing through constitutional law written by hamilton and all those people . 
um , oh , i think it was hamilton who wrote number ten or something , where he was arguing for a republican , not in the sense of the republican party now ,
where he defines democracy as everyone votes for the issues and republic is people who vote for someone who then in turn votes for the issues . 
in other words , you vote for representatives . 
and the whole idea was , um , presumably those who get voted in would be wiser than the average person , and , a specialist and able to make more informed decisions and can protect against the tyranny of democracy , 
because just as you can have a tyranny of a single , um , you know , bad ruler or something , you can have a tyranny of the majority . 
and , uh , he makes a very , uh , passionate , good argument for why you don't want some things decided by democratic process , 
because anytime you have a majority , um , they can change the law in a fully democratic process 
and there are cases when you don't want that to be the case . um , 
 oh , you know , a candi , 
if there's some minority that people don't like because of , you know , racial hatred or something like that , the majority can just simply vote against them . 
 and cases like that , he argues , need to be constrained , 
 and actually i agree , except that i don't trust the people who are appointed to vote .
 sometimes i think we have that right now , with congress . 
well , i feel that wa , 
i think they're looking after their own self preservation more than they're actually looking after the good of the country . 
well their job is to be reelected , by in large , 
and , so they work on that job . 
and there's also an antigovernment mood in the country , you know , where government is misspending your dollars 
 and they're all fools , 
and you know , throw the bastards out , 
that kind of thing . 
and , there's a notion that somehow , if someone isn't as much as a government person , they're less corrupt and they're more likely to be good which is really strange , 
because , i mean , if i'm hiring a plumber , i want a real plumber , 
i want someone trained in , 
well , uh , what do you think about the metric system ? 
uh , do you , uh , find it useable ? 
have you tried much with it ? 
well , with an engineering ,
 because , uh , 
to use you mean , 
is totally unfamiliar with it , uh , human nature being what it is we don't like to change . 
uh , it just absolutely makes perfectly good sense to me because it's all decimal . 
and it's so easy to convert from one set of units to another . 
well i've lived both in the united states and in a country where they do use the metric system 
i've lived with   pounds and inches and found it really quite easy to convert over . 
um , the secret seeming to me to be to not bother ever converting inches to centimeters and ,
that's right . 
how on earth am i every going to do the math ? *[[spelling
and the problem is that we tried to convert everything from inches to centimeters preserving basically the inches but expressing them as centimeters rather than saying no , a centimeter is about the width of your thumbnail , or whatever , you know , and leaving it at that 
and , uh , you know , a kilogram weighs about this much 
and get used to it from scratch , 
cause i still can't convert back and forth from inches to centimeters 
but i'm perfectly comfortable using either . 
and i think the real problem with you see signs that say fiftyfive miles per hour and , you know , whatever it would be one hundred six kilometers per hour , you know , 
people , you know , 
it's hard to take it seriously . 
oh , yeah . 
and as long as both were given , you , basically , just don't read the kilometers per hour , 
the other one must be for someone else . 
that's right . 
uh , i don't know , 
i mean even britain has converted over 
and we inherited this mess from them 
and , uh , 
that's right , 
it's all their fault . 
 well , i mean , it's more our fault than theirs at this point because they saw the light , um , 
i don't know why they um , were more able than we were 
and you sort of have to force people to change since they don't want to .
of course , being part of the european community , if everybody else did it they were probably much more , 
is much more necessary for them than for us . 
that's true , 
that's probably true 
and america does have a long history of sort of doing things our own way rather than adopting , you know , some other model . 
there's an expression for that , 
with eyes on the past , backing confidently into the future . 
i've never heard that one , 
that's very nice .
oh , so i'm all for the metric system and converting over 
and i think , 
i guess , my feeling is the way to do it is to just start giving weights , you know , have a very brief transition period and then just start giving weights and kilometers , er , just as in kilometers and weights and kilograms and everything like that and , uh , just have people start using it rather than having people constantly trying to convert . 
remember me getting a package of something that said one pound , 
this is a package of dates mind you , 
was , presumably something you weigh fairly precisely , 
it said one pound 
and then in parenthesis it said four hundred fiftyfour point six grams .
and , as near as i could tell , seeing that was basically antimetric propaganda 
well , uh , with a quick transition . 
you don't ? 
i think that would be the easiest way 
but human nature being such as it is ,
oh , oh , that's what i was thinking by quick transition , 
i didn't mean , you know , i didn't mean like sweden going over to right hand drive or anything , you know , 
at midnight , tonight we all switch over or anything . 
did they switch ? 
uh , i believe so , 
cause you know , you can't do it gradually . 
that's an example of something you can't do gradually . 
well that's true . 
it has to be kind of a discreet transaction .
it does .
a quantum leap from left to right hand drive .
and they , 
but , you know , that must have taken , uh , 
that was something that had to be done quickly ,
 oh , yes . 
but they decided to do it to make themselves in sync with the rest of europe ,
 you know . 
i'm sure . 
um , so i think it's essential that it's done 
and i think the real trick is to avoid the you know , 
a little more attention to human psychology 
and , whereas , people want round numbers 
and after all , the whole reason to go over to metric is to have round numbers ,
and so what the exact , 
the thing that was best about metric was the thing that was most poorly represented . 
really , i think . 
well , we do have the two liter soda pop bottles . 
i saw that , 
i saw that the other day . 
i don't drink soda pop , 
 but i saw a two liter soda pop bottle 
so , yeah , 
things like that are a good start 
and if you start expressing one liters and one kilograms and then the pounds come in the , you know , the odd numbers ,
that's true . 
well , sure have enjoyed our talk . 
well get back to what you're doing 
and i'll do the same . 
i enjoyed talking with you too . 
god bless y , 
do you exercise a lot ? 
oh , it's uh , scaled back considerably . 
but uh , nine months ago , got married and bought a house 
so my outside activities have been curtailed a lot . 
is mowing the lawn a new exercise  ? 
lawn , 
it's a forty year old house , 
oh , my . 
and yeah , 
painting , lawn , gutters . 
you name it , all kinds of stuff , flower beds . 
i think that's considered exercise whether you want it or not . 
that's true , 
 there's always something to do 
and uh , it keeps me going . 
well , you are so far ahead of me . 
uh , i used to walk two miles a day , 
and i really enjoyed it . 
because the two miles , went fairly quickly . 
i could do it in twentyeight minutes . 
and that's not stopping and talking to everyone along the way , 
but it's a lot . you know . 
it's not too strenuous , 
and i could sort all kinds of things out and make plans and everything , 
but i don't know what i did to my knee . 
i was crawling under a desk , hooking up a computer . 
and i mashed it wrong , or i did something . 
oh , gosh . 
and the doctor has had me on medication , 
and she doesn't want me to walk , 
she said , that's you know , while it's healing , you're going to mess it up , 
so i can't walk . 
and i don't want her to think of surgery on my knee . 
i don't want anyone to think about that  , ever . 
that's a tough situation . 
that's that microscopic stuff , you know . 
not my kneecap . 
so , i'm being very good . 
but , i miss it . 
i really do , 
and i . 
oh , that , 
it's so aggravating uh , to have an injury like that . 
my wife , uh , or likes to run , 
but uh , she's , 
well , we moved down to the north end of oak cliff in the castle park area . 
oh , really . 
and she started running down there and all the hills . 
and she lasted about two weeks , 
and her ankles couldn't take it anymore . 
she was used to running , you know flat tracks and whatnot , 
and uh , ever since that , it's just been real difficult . 
it's real aggravating , because she starts in 
and her ankles will start hurting again and stuff . even if she does get on flat ground , 
so she's kind of in the same mode . 
she was all ready to get back into it and start running , uh five k's , and ten k's and stuff this spring , 
and she just hasn't been able to stick with the training schedule long enough to really get back in shape . 
and , when you want to do it , it's really , really aggravating . 
you know , it's one thing to get motivated to start doing the exercise , 
and it's another thing to already be past that and then not be able to because of your health . 
i can you understand that . 
uh , i don't really want to , 
i just , know i need to . 
well , it's . . . 
i make myself do it 
and if i do it , okay , 
i don't love it ,  , 
but i will do it . 
uh , it's not anything i would want to , 
but i can really tell the difference , since i have not been able to walk . 
i have got to be so much more careful with what i do . 
it's depressing . 
it is , 
and you know , you don't spi , well . 
speaking for myself i don't sleep as well , when i am not exercising , 
and uh , it's harder to get out of bed in the morning and all kinds of stuff , 
your body just gets used to it . 
i don't particularly enjoy it . 
well i used to lift weights an awful lot , and stuff like that . 
i do enjoy riding bike , 
but as far as the working out and lifting and things like that . uh , i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much , 
but once i got used to it , it was habit forming . 
it was , 
i felt so bad if i didn't , 
physically , i mean 
i just , 
my body that mode , 
and the whole system out of whack . 
hopefully my knee is a hundred percent better . 
maybe i can get back into it . 
that's for sure . 
you're living in the castle park area ? 
i grew up in oak cliff . 
did you really ? 
uh , just close to methodist hospital . 
on candy , 
c a n d y . 
oh , in fact , i lived there oh , until late nineteen fifties . 
and that area , is it changing back again ? 
so many people are moving back into those old houses and are restoring them . 
uh , we're on a little street called bison trail . 
it's only about a block and a half long , 
but it's over on the other end . 
it's over by the far edge of , uh , stephen's park golf course . 
oh , i know exactly where that is . 
it's uh , 
you know where the little bridge is on north oak cliff boulevard ? 
we are just south of that little bridge , backup on the hill in the trees there , 
and yeah , 
uh , our street is uh , an awful lot of retired people , 
but the other half , 
in fact , our one little block and a half there , four houses sold last summer 
and three sold the summer before , 
and everybody in their late twenties to midthirties are buying , and starting to rebuild and fix things up again 
and everybody is real excited . 
oh , that's wonderful . 
that is a gorgeous , gorgeous place . 
oh , it's a lot of fun , 
the people are great . 
there too , we've got a real active neighborhood association . 
and uh , well , we've got four regular parties every year 
and we do a neighborhood recycling program and , all that kind of stuff . 
so , it's a lot of fun 
and it's a really beautiful area . 
and uh , some of the higher dollars lawyers and stuff downtown too , are picking up some of those great big houses , 
and they're getting them at a real bargain . 
they are . 
you know . 
they're getting four thousand square feet for a hundred fifty , a hundred and seventyfive thousand dollars . 
uh , and they're just going to town with them . 
and completely redoing the outside restoring to the original , you know , nineteen thirty , nineteen forties look . 
oh , wow . 
and it's really coming around . 
i guess . . . 
i need to go over there and just drive around and look . 
it's worth the trip . 
oh , i'm sure it must be . 
i'm just , 
we had a lovely little house over there , 
it was like a two story . 
well , story and a half , really , because we had a basement . 
and the guy that built it was weird , 
i mean weird .
it's one of these really creative houses ,
oh , wow . 
and i just loved the neighborhood . 
and i mean , everyone had houses like that . 
they were all completely different . 
that's right . 
and so neat . 
ours is kind of a little ranch style with a great big , oh , i guess , it's twentyeight by fifteen front porch . 
next door , we've got an austin stone . 
across the street , the guy , 
it was burnt out about two years ago 
 and the guy moved in and completely redid 
oh , it's got a rounded front on it . 
it's all brick , 
and he's landscaped his yard 
and he's about ready to put in a pool and things like that . 
so , yeah , 
there's a variety , 
you just don't see it anywhere else , as far as the different styles in the houses and whatnot . 
now , why couldn't your wife run around the golf course ? 
is that not good ? 
oh , she could , a little bit . 
we got into the fitness center at methodist 
and they have a quarter mile track there . 
so she has started doing that uh , rather than take off . 
the problem is she's a school teacher 
and for her , she can't run in the morning . 
for her to get home and try to run at six o'clock in the night , in the winter time , it's starting to get dark 
and , you know , you don't want to , 
she doesn't want to be out by herself anywhere in dallas . 
regardless whether it's north dallas or whatnot , when she goes over to this fitness center , it's fenced in , 
and there's somebody in the building , watching her and all that , 
so there's a lot of consideration . 
i really hear that , you know , 
but , i'm in plano . 
in west plano . 
and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block . 
we all know each other , 
and the street doesn't go anywhere . 
if you are on the street , you better belong there .
that's right . 
that's right . 
and , still , i want to get up early in the morning and walk .
and my husband had a lot of heartburn with that . 
i mean , it looked darker to him , because he was in the house with the lights on . 
when i was out walking , it , was more of a predawn type , 
pretty , but , 
he didn't think it looked predawn to him . 
it looked dark . 
and even he was real concerned about that . 
so , it's not just because you are in oak cliff , 
it's just because you're smart . 
that's true . 
that you don't do things like that . 
it only takes one time . 
that's right . 
it's a hard lesson to learn . 
there's only one crazy out there , you know , to make any difference . 
you know , it goes all over 
well , you got the . 
i guess so .
tell me how yours works . 
well , at the my , 
i introduced you a little bit to it , a few minutes ago , when i said that uh , we're on the east coast now . 
my husband quit a perfectly wonderful job and decided that , 
well , we both decided we wanted to move to north carolina . 
and so naturally we put ourselves , 
we looked at our budget , 
 and so , what we did was draw up a budget that we thought , uh , was realistic . 
and , uh , so , we had to make some adjustments 
because we really are kind of looking for something that we want to do and he wants to do that's satisfactory , 
and we've been here seven months 
and he's still hasn't hit up on anything permanently . 
oh , no . 
so , you see , 
that throws the budget out of whack real fast . 
oh , good . 
uh , that god because , *[[listen
that was smart . 
and , uh , what we did was just , uh , decide how we had been spending our money before , 
 and then we put that on the computer 
and then we took about three months uh , and adjusted ,
 oh , uhhuh . 
 and we really , uh , lessened uh , our living expenses , uh , more than what we thought we would . 
wow , that's great . 
oh , just our own design . 
and the , 
so , but we've had budgets that didn't work when our , uh , you know , 
our first fifteen years or eighteen years of being married nothing worked .
we spent too much money ,
do you all , uh , have a budget ? 
well , we've been married for five and a half years 
and we started out without kids , of course , and found it much easier to save and used to do a lot  , more fun kinds of of things and , uh , did really , um , you know , have a real strict but , budget 
but , uh , the 
 about and  
to our , 
when we first got married we were in graduate school 
and we were just , you know , dirt poor . 
then when we got our first jobs after about a year of marriage we decided we'd bank my salary so we could buy a house . 
so , we virtually did that for about two years ,
so , i don't know if we did a good thing to buy a house or not 
but at least we've got a place to live . 
um , so , now , since , uh , we have a three year old and a two year old now , um , 
three and a two year old . 
bang , *[[one utt ? ?
that threw our budget really out of whack too . 
an we , um , have been just forced to budget much more because i quit working to be home with the kids . 
and , um , we just really have , uh , 
i don't know , 
we've tried different times , 
we've done like a survey of like taking , you know , the past three months of where all the money went . 
and we really don't spend on anything much of a luxury or anything at all , 
but it seems like there's , um , times when we just have to get out where we'll go and like get a babysitter and we'll go and we'll blow , you know , fifty , sixty dollars in one night going out to eat , going to a show or doing something , you know . 
well , i think that's important for your budget to be realis , 
for it to work though , you have to do something . 
that's the hard part because when we sit down to make it , we try to make it real spartan and real narrow so we can put a certain amount in savings every week 
and then it's not really that realistic 
because we do find that we want to go and do something or splurge for , you know , birthday for somebody 
or , you know , we even do things real frugally for the kids , 
of course not . 
and they're both boys 
so they just   one year after the other in each other's clothes , 
so . but , um , that's the hardest part for us is that it's really , um , you know , budgeting and some extra things , you know , that are more , you know , nonessential items . 
well , i found , uh , that , in the place that it was harder for me to stick to a budget was not where we were concerned ,
uh , we tended to want to keep on giving lavish ,
and i really believe that if you're going to cut down on yourself , you need to cut down somewhat on your friends . 
 on your friends , 
that's true , 
well , we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with , 
we both have older cars 
and something will come up and wind up having to spend a thousand dollars , you know , on the car in two months or something , 
 and , you know , a lot of things like that that really are hard to plan for . 
and , uh , 
well , i really do , 
i think you have to budget those things though . 
kind of put in a certain amount per year , *[[82 and 84 same utt ?
you're going to have on extra expenses for car . 
 although  so much per month anyway . 
and , uh , that really should be in your bu , 
but if you don't spend it , it should be in your bank account at the end of the month .
 our biggest way of saving money is then to stop all these deductions , um , you know , is to , 
let's see , 
now , i forget which way we do it . 
we don't list all the deductions 
and then we get more money back , you know , at the end of the year , 
 oh , no , 
 so , that's not a good way to  , 
you don't want the government to spend your money . 
you want to be able , 
that's what my husband said , 
so this last year he changed it , of course , 
we didn't get nearly as much back 
better find another way of saving money .
well , uh , but i do realize that , that is realistic for some people , 
 and it was for us many years ,
uh , the year then doggone it that's what you should do . 
because we don't miss it , 
we really don't , when it's just taking out of the paycheck and stuff , 
well , i was just reading an article in , uh , a north carolina paper today where a high school student obtained over two hundred thousand dollars worth of scholarships for herself by sitting up at night and typing at , uh , letters of applications to universities . 
she was third out of a class of two hundred and twenty , 
so , it can be done . 
that's fantastic . 
well , i have enjoyed talking to you . 
well , i enjoyed talking to you too , 
good luck 
and don't spend any money this weekend .
oh , i know 
 we'll  have to stay home and mow the yard .
oh , boy . 
go ahead . 
what kind of books do you like to read ? 
 oh   , i like all kinds of books . 
mostly , uh , something , i like like true life ,
and , uh , i also like romantic novels . 
uh , i like readers digest , believe it or not . 
so do i . 
i usually read that from cover to cover . 
i like it because there's a little bit of everything in it . 
uh , as far as like real novels , i haven't gotten into shakespeare or any of that type of thing . 
i wish i had in some senses 
but i don't have time really as much as i would like to get into that kind of thing . 
how about you ? 
um , well , i like , like you said , real life , um , 
i like biographies of people's lives ,
for some reason it seems to interest me , like people that make a big comeback or , 
and , um , i like to read books on improve , like family , marriage , you know , things that are written by like christian authors or , um , doctors about family and , you know , how to improve your home and all that kind of thing . 
um , i like to re , 
the magazines i 
to rel , 
i like to read    , 
i read a lot of bicycling magazines . 
i mainly look at the pictures and stuff , 
but they usually have some good articles in it . 
but , uh , i don't know 
i haven't really found any romance type stuff i like to read . 
i'm more true , you know , 
i haven't found a lot of , uh , fiction books that i really like 
but , uh , not to say i wouldn't , 
eventually i mean . *[[one utt or two with a .29 ?
what was the last book you read ? 
uh , jeez , 
let me think , 
i tell you i haven't read a book in a long time . 
and it , 
i can't even really remember . 
uh , i think it was a romantic novel by danielle steel or one of those . 
you know  , yeah , 
um , i don't do as much reading , like i say , as i would like to . 
  working a lot of hours at work 
and then , of course ,
i know . 
so it's , you know , 
a lot time is spent doing things as far as the yard work or housework or ,
i set a goal for myself to read a book a month this year which is like about eleven more books than i would have read last year , 
but so far i've only read like two books 
and so i'm not doing very well 
but see i do crafts too , 
 so it's hard , 
i do . 
i find it's real hard , 
i let newspapers stack up and magazines stack up , if i don't really set aside a time to look or read them . 
that's the , 
 and that's like myself 
i miss it , because i really find it a very relaxing hobby too . 
i really do 
and , um , i don't know 
it seems like you can get lost in a book , you know , 
i don't know about you . 
if i'm really interested in what i'm reading , i mean , hours can go by 
in fact , i'd rather read sometimes than watch t v . 
oh , i would too . 
but i think you get out of the habit , like you say , 
you have to like kind of set yourself , 
have you ever read , uh , or heard of the book this present darkness ? 
that was one of the books i read this year , 
and it's really fast paced and intense . 
it or is a fiction book 
but it was ar , 
it was one of the best i read , 
i mean , it was real good , 
and um , it was one of the few books that 
like it , you know , 
just hurry up and go through without putting down , you know . 
see that's the other problem i have . 
if i start into something and i really enjoy what i'm reading ,
i'll stay up until two or three o'clock in the morning , you know , because i'm so engrossed in it 
and then before you know it's time to get up and go to work . 
that's why 
i don't know 
i'm kind of a nut when it comes to stuff like that . 
even if i'm , uh , doing something like an afghan , if i'm close to the end , sometimes i'll  , do the same thing . 
i don't know what you would call it , 
maybe i have a problem .
i'm sure it's fast   or something . 
it's terrible , 
that you can get into 
and that's that . 
i know what you mean . 
i like reading late at night right before i go to bed sometimes 
i just sleep better or something . 
oh , yeah , 
you do 
you kind of get relaxed , 
that's true . 
but , uh , 
i have a lot of craft books that i have too and , uh , magazines . 
i like people , you know , those things that are about real people . 
and , um , i like to , uh , read about people who have been a successful , 
what book have you read that is along those lines ,
well , how about who , 
like i say , haven't done it in such a long time . 
do you know who it was about ? 
um , well , i went to , uh , seminar on , uh , 
it was by american business 
and some of the people , uh , 
what the heck was his name , 
i'm trying to think . 
he's one of the , uh , 
paroe , *[[spelling: perot
and um , it was more like , oh , 
it was tapes and things that they had about him , too . 
how he started out as just a salesman and now he's , you know , multimillionaire and that type of thing , 
and how you have to , uh , be aggressive and , you know , really want something for yourself and that type of stuff . 
it's like up to you , in other words , whatever happens in your life . 
it's not up , 
it's not someone else , 
you have to do it . 
and then do it . 
i can't , 
i'm not that focused on something . 
i'm off in all directions . 
um , and i'm not , uh , uh , a planner which i wish i was . 
you know , kind of off the wall . 
if someone says , do you want to do this tonight , uh , and i got a mountain of things to do , it's okay , you know , we do it . 
huh . well , that's all right . 
i know , 
but i wish i was more the other way . 
you're more fun though , see . 
 see   , i like it that way though . 
i don't want to change that part of me . 
that's good . 
that's funny , 
even though i admire someone who isn't ,
there may be some schools you could read about and learn . 
that's true , 
how many people do you supervise ? 
uh , about twenty . 
oh , that's not bad . 
that's not bad at all . 
do you like your job ? 
sometimes more than others . 
but , yeah , 
i do . 
oh , that's , 
i've been there about three years . 
do you have a family ? 
and , um , most of my family's in indiana . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , i've only been in texas three years . 
do you like it ? 
i love the weather down here . 
i loved abilene too . 
that's what i liked , too , is the weather . 
i know . 
except for tornados .
boy they have storms here 
they do . 
and it , 
hail and thunder and , 
were you here during the hailstorm two years ago ? 
uh , no . 
uh , we were down there , uh , from eightyfive to eightysix , 
no , uh , 
well , part of eightyfour to eightysix i should say . 
boy i had thirtythree hundred dollars damage done on my car , 
a lot of people had their cars totaled just from hail . 
oh , wow . 
i think state farm went bankrupt .
oh , jeez . 
but , uh , 
i know the whole situation is bad up here , 
we're having a terrible time with the recession . 
it's not good at all . 
i know things are pretty booming down there . 
i heard they sold  johnson city   though  .
and colorado springs . 
and he was telling me about it . 
oh , wow . 
they just sold it . 
closed up and moved down to mckinney . 
oh , well , that's good . 
at least they kept the business part of it . 
it's scary though i'm telling you . 
 i know  .
i don't know , 
how do i feel what ? 
that books influence , 
i feel like it's important for young children to read too .
when my children were younger , of course , 
they were all married and grown 
and i have grandchildren now , 
they were , uh , 
i , i read to them a lot . 
that's good . 
and , uh , i think they've all developed kind of an interest in reading also . 
that's re , 
i'm not saying they read all the right things 
but they do read . uh , where a lot of people don't have any interest in it at all , 
and i think it's important , 
 oh , yeah . 
 because , uh , even today where people are so illiterate and they go off to school and really nothing happens , i mean , they don't learn anything . 
it's because they can't read . 
it's really surprising how many people graduate from high school ,
and people , i mean , 
i get memos all the time across my desk 
and things are misspelled 
 oh , it's unbelievable , 
isn't it ? 
a lot of people that work for me that can't even spell or read , you know . 
and i think that that's why reading is so important , 
because , uh , i think even mentally when you can do some , 
i don't , 
guess we got our first , uh , credit card , oh , back in the early seventies when ,
was a visa card . uh , issued out of a liberty bank in oklahoma city , 
because my sister worked at  some  bank americard center there . *[[one utt with a .3 utt2 ? 
so , we were still in college 
and had she not worked there i'm not sure that i would have qualified . 
they've come in handy over the years . 
uh , and they have become , a real bother sometimes . 
oh , tell me about it .
especially , you know , if you catch yourself short on cash or if you're on vacation ,
and , uh , i find if you're not careful you wind up , uh , a month or so , staring those bills in the face 
and it adds up . 
they add up quick .
so , sometimes , uh , especially traveling with t i ,
and it makes it a whole lot easier for bookkeeping . 
but , uh , as far as personal life goes , i guess , i really try to use them as little as possible , uh , 
i kind of like having them for , uh , gasoline purchases . 
we like to keep one on hand just for emergencies , you know . 
but other than that , uh , i guess over the years tried to avoid the national credit card syndrome ,
and then , 
how do you look at  counting  credit cards ? 
we just , uh , quit using them .
well , that's , 
and they got us in trouble , 
we took a loan and paid them all off . 
uh , and , uh , visa just , you know , in case there's an emergency or ,
but other than that we don't use them anymore .
well , that's kind of the way we  were doing  
it's , uh , 
i guess for that very reason that , uh , if you're not real conscious of what you're doing ,
well , if you got a bunch of cards ,
and for some strange reason those people think they need to get paid . 
i know , 
isn't that funny ? 
and i give them , 
maybe they're not really concerned about getting paid 
because they're , 
know if you don't ,
and then some of them add late fees on it ,
i guess that's one of the motivations behind the , 
there's no , 
with the american express card from t i ,
 uhhuh  .
there's no , uh , interest rate , 
oh , really ? 
you either pay the thing off 
or they come get it . 
and it's turned into personnel 
and they come get you .
so , they've got quite a bit more motivation i think to get paid then ,
oh , yeah . 
but that's the one that your call center manager sees every month , 
so , you're a little bit more careful about what you put on that ,
oh , yeah . 
oh , you can ? 
oh , i see , huh . 
and who knows how many people ,
you're not the only one . 
so , uh , you want to make sure that , uh , is that okay , 
is that okay , that those people see what it is that you are buying , 
and most of the time it is . 
but , most of the others i've sent back , i mean , all you get is card offers , *[[two utts
i've got three card offers now ,
citibank i think is always sending  the  visa stuff out . 
and i usually just throw them away because i ,
oh , i do too , 
i don't even open them much , 
i throw them out . 
i don't want to have to mess with it . 
you  know  you carry around a wallet full of credit cards , 
and , uh , one of these days it's going to all be full . 
a girlfriend of mine found a , 
it was a visa or mastercard , 
she found an ad for one in like a good housekeeping magazine for eleven percent . 
oh , that's not bad . 
  shoot i need one of those .
if they don't say , no annual membership on them , i'll throw them away . 
and then they started charging , uh , annual membership fees , 
and i said , adios , you know , i'm not paying you , 
why do they do that ? 
it's just another way to make money ,
i mean , 
i mean , they've been , 
well , sure . 
and i guess , they figure they've got enough people out there with cards , 
they're going to get cards at 
there's going to be that much more . 
uh , so , then a couple years ago i found , uh , a bank here in plano that if you kept a minimum balance in any kind of account whether it was a savings account or what it was , you can get a visa card through them and no annual membership . 
so , i went over and just stuck three hundred dollars in my son's savings account , in his name , and got my visa card , 
but i can't see paying someone to use their card . 
i can't either . 
be charged their eighteen percent interest , 
i think you're right . 
the best philosophy is have them if you need them , but otherwise leave them tucked away somewhere . 
it sure does . 
maybe they're counting on that , 
i don't know . 
thanks for talking . 
nice talking to you . 
do you have any particular thoughts about the school system ? 
in , uh , 
recently with the , 
i'm not sure if it's more a problem with american families or a problem with the school system . 
they seem to be burdening the school system more and more with problems , any problems that a child might have , whether it's actually a school related thing or not 
i agree with you a hundred percent there .
and , well , it's gotten to a point where the schools are expected to take care of everything . 
if , uh , you've some kid uh , who's from a broken family , the schools are supposed to fill that void . 
it's interesting 
because , uh , we're just having conversation on this , uh , with a couple of people yesterday . 
and i was expressing my frustrations that , uh , a degree of selfdiscipline which may be reflected in society at large . 
uh , and you can't expect in a classroom for a particular course an hour a day to counteract , uh , sixteen or seventeen years of influence at home . 
um , and , it's seen more so because when you call parents up , many parents won't even recognize that there is a problem 
i've never heard anything about this before . 
this is the first time there have been problems . 
and , you wonder , don't these parents know that teachers talk , 
and , you know , we do check with other teachers , 
and other teachers find the same things in 
but , um , it is a problem , 
and i'm not sure just , uh , how the school system could operate in a vacuum on it . 
whether maybe through a commitment of the p t a , uh , and the parents being informed better , that in fact that the problems that are nationwide 
well , then again when you have , uh , a society where a certain percentage of the parents are , uh , doing drugs in the home 
you can't really expect that parent who's , quite frankly 
that's right . 
you know what scares me too , is that we have yet to see the biggest effect of the crack children 
these are children that are born with low attention deficit 
 and , gosh , what's going to happen when these kids start coming into the school system . 
that's really scary .
but i think there are a couple of areas where the school system can improve , 
and this is something that i see . 
get diagnosed as slow learners , 
and in fact they're not . 
they're behavior problems . 
and so , they get put in our school system , in a class that's limited for skills children 
and that's not their problem . 
um , at the same time , i've seen , an international population . 
there's no bridge area for students coming out of the e s o l , which is english for speakers of other languages 
once they're past e s o l , they get out , 
they got thrown right into the total mainstream 
 and , uh , there really needs to be a bridge , some sort of transition 
so the school systems can improve , both in standing up for splitting classes , you know , having slow children in slow classes , but not mixing them with behavior problems . 
and then , you know , the case where they put the behavior problems in the average classes , 
you get these kids that are average students but highly motivated . 
and then you throw in kids that are not motivated , maybe bright , but they're discipline problems . 
and you sometimes 
the average classes really are problems 
you know , the gifted and talented are fast classes . 
there's really not that much of a problem with . 
 but it's , 
 well , i've seen more , uh , incredibly intelligent underachievers than , 
i would take a person who's motivated and a little , uh , less intelligent 
i remember i had a college professor who once said that genius is one percent inspiration , and ninetynine percent perspiration . 
 well , i was graduated from my high school , 
i was the valedictorian , 
and i know 
and they proved out late when it came time to take the s a t s . 
mine were 
but they weren't great . 
 and , uh , when i got into college in the field that i was in . 
whereas i knew people that in high school were kind of lazy and all , 
but they got motivated in college 
and they did a lot better than i did . 
and when it , 
 i guess kids do mature at different ages 
and , you know , as a teacher be understanding that , you know , there are different ages , 
kids are , 
is this a , 
got a kid that just a question of maturity , 
or is he a 
but teachers are asked to diagnose so much . 
um , i mean we're , have to be , 
we're alerted 
there's all sorts of systems where suicide , uh , predisposition . 
i mean , we're alerted to what the moment we see something . 
if we see a child there are certain things to do . 
i mean , so the school system's asked to do so much , 
but you can't operate in a vacuum . 
you actually have students with beepers ? 
we're in a rather wealthy suburb of washington . 
and a student with a beeper immediately gets sent down to the , uh , principal . 
i mean , where , 
what are the , 
what could they possibly be thinking . 
i mean how . 
it's for drug use . 
they can't imagine for anything else . 
you know , it's amazing , 
but uh , all sorts of things , uh , in the schools , uh , uh , 
and it's , 
and you know , as a teacher you're alert for the kid who's very drowsy . 
you're alert to the kid who suddenly has a , um , behavioral change , 
and you refer them to the nurse . 
and , so , i mean , you have to find out whether there's a legitimate reason , or whether this is a warning signal . 
how can you expect to , 
oh yeah , 
i was , uh , sitting in the barber shop . 
i'm an officer in the air force , 
and i was having my hair cut 
 and the barber got a call while i was there , uh , from his son's school . 
his son's in high school . 
and his son was failing gym uh , and having trouble ,
but , you know , it's like , uh , this guy was like , why now , there's no problem with my kid . 
my kid's a great kid and all this . 
the kid had missed all these classes , 
and basically 
the denial mechanism is really strong 
and so many parents are facilitators . 
i mean , they're manipulated by their children . 
i've been fortunate . 
i have , uh , a son who's a sophomore in college up in massachusetts 
and my other son is a senior in high school , 
and he's going on to williams . 
and i mean , they're really super . 
they're both national level 
and we've been very fortunate , 
but , you know , they had to be held accountable 
i mean , you know , at some point a parent does help their kid , in some ways , 
but you have to say at what point isn't the help becoming negative . 
and i think this is where the school system is suffering , and not through any fault of the effort 
but gee it was good talking with you . 
it was good talking to you too . 
so there are people throughout the country that feel 
i've had interesting conversations on several subjects the different 
it's amazing how the , you know , people you talk to have some interesting conversations 
and , uh , it's too bad that all this stuff is just being thrown into a data base , and that none of the ideas or thoughts are being used at all .
well , we are , though .
that's true . 
good luck . 
take care , 
well what movies do you like ? 
i like just about anything . 
i think the last one we saw was , uh , teenage mutant ninja turtles part two . 
oh , now , i like the turtles . 
my little boy's four 
and he loves them . 
well , we don't have any kids 
but we like them anyway . 
 oh , that's okay . 
how old are you all ? 
um , we're late twenties . 
oh , and you just don't have any yet , 
well i've got two . 
oh , gosh . 
my little girl is three months old 
and my little boy just turned four . 
i had his birthday party yesterday . 
but he's a turtle fanatic . 
he even had turtle cake yesterday .
but i've been wanting to see turtle two . 
is it as good as they say it is ? 
it was , 
it was actually better than the first one , i thought . 
what's the last movie you saw ? 
i was asking my husband right quick , what's the last movies we saw . 
he said well ghost and turtles . 
i really liked it . 
now ghost , 
i love tearjerker movies . 
but that wasn't too bad on tearjerker 
not too awful bad . 
because that was just so good . 
and i like demi moore . 
did you see pretty woman ? 
we don't get to the video store very often 
and we don't have cable . 
oh , gosh . 
well we don't really want cable , 
it's just , you know , glued to the t v all the time anyway . 
so we get two channels down here . 
  i'm from kentucky originally , 
and we used to get five channels without cable . 
you know , forty , 
well i don't think you all have the same channels , 
but here in texas we only get two channels , 
and that's , um , 
do you watch soap operas ? 
you work then ? 
well we get the channel with young and the restless on it . 
and then , uh , i think general hospital 
and that comes on different channel . 
it does . 
but that's all we get , 
and that's no cartoons for my little boy . 
but we've got a v c r and a lot of tapes . 
and , uh , my husband is a movie fanatic . 
i think you would really like pretty woman , 
it was really a , 
it made you feel really good . 
it was just a happy movie . 
oh , what about total recall , 
have you seen that . 
that's good . 
i was disappointed in it just because of how violent it was . 
it was violent . 
i try to get away from that . 
my little boy , oh , he loves robo cop . 
and that movie , i'll fast forward it every time they come to the part where there is , 
have you seen it ? 
the part where they're shooting  mercy  .
i don't like that . 
oh , that's horrible , 
and the language on that's filthy . 
i don't see why they have to do that , 
i mean , 
i know . 
but i think lately pretty woman's been my favorite . 
i went and bought the video . 
i've probably seen it about fifteen or twenty times . 
um , my husband bought me , like , um , uh , i think pretty in pink for my birthday . 
with , a , 
wait a second , 
i will in a minute kyle , .
that's okay . 
uh , he bought me pretty in pink . 
just a second . 
now , you're glad you ain't got a four year old . 
that's okay .
this is the first time he's interrupted my phone calls . 
molly ringwald . 
it was cute , 
but , it wasn't , 
i like the , um , sixteen candles , or sixteenth birthday or , 
oh , that was so good . 
of course i was a teenager when i seen that 
and i loved it . 
i haven't seen it either . 
oh , well if you like love stories , it's sweet . 
i do . 
oh , it's sweet , 
it really is .
and that's a tearjerker 
it gets you , 
i mean it makes you feel really sorry for her . 
oh , gosh . 
but it's hilarious too , especially with that , uh , little guy in it . 
oh i don't know , he looks like a little boy next door , 
but he's sixteen . 
oh , it's a cute movie . 
i can't remember his name . 
he kind of looks like doogie howser . 
huh , i don't know . 
don't know either . 
he's got curly blonde hair , 
he just a little freckly , little boy . 
probably know him if i saw him . 
if i could remember the name , i know you'd know his name , because he's played in a few movies . 
but , uh , 
i was just thinking another good one i saw not too long ago was , um , sleeping with the enemy . 
i've heard about that 
but i can't remember it . 
that's julia roberts' new movie . 
julia roberts is good . 
this one , 
you know pretty woman was kind of a light comedy and a romance , 
and this one was a lot more dramatic . 
wasn't it a murder mystery ? 
like , sort of .
it was a mystery . 
she disappeared from her uh , husband who was abusing her . 
oh , okay , 
 at a carnival on a ferris wheel or something . 
and i think , you know , around here , it's all ready quit playing . 
but i don't know if it's still playing any where else . 
well i think , 
but it was , 
real good . 
i want to see that . 
i seen the , uh , previews for it on t v down here , 
but it's just been down here a couple weeks , i think . 
oh , okay , 
because we saw it , probably ,
a month a , 
well i know it hasn't been that long since i've seen the previews for it , 
but yeah , 
i wanted to see it . 
her husband was a , dark haired guy with a beard and moustache , 
or a , 
he shaved the beard off . 
uh , he was a real psycho in the movie . 
it was scary . 
oh , i'd like to see that . 
what about , oh , 
there was a , 
we got one back here a while , 
i want to see war of the roses too , 
have you seen that ? 
oh yeah , 
you didn't ? 
it was , 
i didn't like the way it ended . 
i know , 
well the only reason i know why it ended is on arsenio hall one night , christopher reeves told ,
i can't believe they killed them . 
 or who was it 
might have been michael douglas . oh , that starred in it . *[[listen
it was michael douglas . 
christopher reeve wasn't in it at all ? 
well arsenio hall is the one that jumped up and said that i can't believe they killed them 
and christopher reeve , or , mike douglas went after his throat , you dummy .
so i know that they die , 
but i haven't told my husband . 
we've both been wanting to see it . 
it was weird . 
it was a different movie from anything i've ever seen . 
and they marked off routes that they could go or something .
we've only got one bathroom , 
i don't know h ,  , 
we've got two bathrooms 
but , well mi , 
actually , if he takes , 
my house kind of looks like two trailers put together . 
and one bathroom is at the end of one side 
and one's in the middle of the other , 
so we could do it . 
that wouldn't be too bad . 
and he could climb out the window .
and our whole house has , you know , 
every room leads to three rooms , 
so we can , you know 
get around . 
you can get around .
you just can't go out the front door honey , 
 well did you see fatal attraction ? 
i know it's going to be on c b s tuesday night 
in a way , you know , how it kind of bothered you , the way it ended and stuff . 
that's kind of how war of the roses was . 
huh , i , 
parts of war of the roses was funny 
but then other times it was like it was just deadly serious , 
and it just left you with this kind of uneasy feeling , you know . 
eerie feeling , 
or , i want to see it though . 
i'd like to see that and , uh , the never ending story , came out on disney this month , i think . 
i wanted to see that . 
but i don't know what it's about . 
the never ending story ? 
it's a child's movie , 
but , oh , it's good , 
i enjoyed it . 
i love disney movies . 
i do too 
i mean , they're some of the best that are made . 
and , uh , well it's about this little boy who , uh , 
i think he's up in a attic , or some part of school . 
he got locked in the school 
and he got scared , 
but he starts dreaming 
and then , uh , he's saving the land of , uh , oh , 
it's been so long since i've seen it . 
all's i can really remember is him flying this great big dog , this great big huge sheep dog sort of looking thing , 
oh go , 
it flies through the air . 
and he's trying to save the land from some ,  ooze  .
but it's really good , 
i mean it sounds ki , 
it had , uh , fred savage in it . 
did you see that movie with fred savage in it , though , 
i don't think so . 
with , uh , oh , 
he had , uh , uh , 
oh it was the princess bride . 
you didn't see that , 
that was cute , 
that was a good one . 
i like slapstick comedy . 
so do i 
and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something 
and you're not sure whether it will be any good or not 
so sometimes we stick with the stuff we've heard more about than , 
well i heard , 
a friend of mine told me she got naked gun last night 
and she said that was hilarious . 
now , we saw that , 
 and they're coming out with a sequel to it . 
two and a half  . *[[is this a title ? ?
it was funny . 
it wa , 
i want to see that . 
she said she rented it last night 
and said it was real good 
and working girl is really good . 
now , i seen that , 
that was good . 
was that with that blonde , 
she pretended to be the boss or something . 
i rented that one night by myself . 
i was home alone . 
did you see home alone ? .
that just reminded me of that . 
did you like it ? 
first question , 
do you own your house ? 
i mean it's a big mortgage in the sky 
and someday , maybe , we might even own it , 
but , um , for all practical purposes , i guess we hold the mortgage .
our name is on the till , 
so that implies ownership . 
no one else has offered to pay for it . 
that's right . 
i would not object if anybody did . 
really they could move right into the spare room .
well , we have had this one for five years now . 
before that we lived in garland , uh , probably about , you know , four blocks away . 
liked the area , chose to stay inside of spring park . 
it's a , uh , 
i don't know if you have been up here , 
but it is a residential homeowners ,
so , there's a lot of , you know , activities , a lot of pluses and common land . 
but , uh , we thought we were buying at the bottom of the market , you know , 
it could not possibly have gone any lower 
and so we were wrong .
oh , five years ago . 
i think , 
it bottom out about a year later . 
it , well , 
i mean just recently , i would say , i would give it two years back , when it was , i think , bottomed out . 
oddly enough , two years , you know , 
uh , i think that , 
but , maybe not in your area , 
see , it was just different areas , 
not in , uh , this area . 
cause this is about like the , 
that's a really nice area . 
it's still considered garland . 
oh , ok , 
it's , richardson 
and , hold on a second . 
paul , i can hear you perfectly , perfectly well , 
i don't want to hear you . 
you are being rude . 
whatever you ask or scream when i'm on the phone , the answer is no . 
do you understand ? 
there you go . 
write that one down . 
it sounded good to me .
well , i hate to say how long that will last too . 
this area up here is , uh , all custom homes , 
i don't think that many by the builder that built this house . 
and , we were not the first owners , 
i think we are the third owners . 
uh , okay . 
it was built by the architect for himself , no idea that homes ever needed upkeep . 
 oh , no . 
 oh , yeah , 
caulking windows was a great mystery to them . 
oh , gee . 
so , they just watched the water pour in on the carpet . 
 but , it's a sharif myneer homes , if that means anything , 
it did not really mean anything to me except , 
he builds eight hundred thousand dollar houses now . 
i think he got out of the lower end market .
but , the houses here in this class of housing never dropped below two hundred . 
oh , wow . 
well but , still i know that this one was built for two ninety nine , which is nowhere near what we paid for it . 
and i think somebody told me it's also on a creek side lot , heavily wooded off the golf course . 
oh , great . 
and the guy around the corner is being transferred 
so he said , uh , well , he did comparables that it's about eighty dollars , 
let's see what , 
i don't remember if he said it was sixty dollars a square foot  ,
probably eighty . 
i think it was sixty , eighty . 
sixty , eighty . 
i think . 
 well because , i know our little house over here stuck in the middle of , you know , the subdivision is , i think fifty five , 
so , i think the high end is definitely , .
well , try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot .
it could not be , 
because this house has around thirty four hundred square feet , 
and it would never sell for three hundred forty thousand dollars . 
just never . 
now , maybe , you know , that's pretty close to what it would have sold for , uh , brand new , 
or that's pretty much what it was built for . 
it's got an awful lot of nice things in it 
but , you know , i think it's going to be a long time , if ever , when nice things and really quality construction and all the other additional amenities uh , desirable . 
it's seems like people go for square footage only now 
 and , uh , cause . have you been back to the perry homes , back here ? 
um ,  ? 
the one that looks like monopoly apartments . 
i think those are awful . 
i'm sorry , 
i just don't see the designer's , 
i just see him as trying to squish you know , as much house into the space as possible . 
they are huge when you are inside them . 
they are very spacious . 
they are , you know , 
  i was in one today . 
it was forty two hundred square feet . 
well see that's , 
the house that we got is small enough so my husband and i , 
because there's just the two of us 
and the two cats , um , can yell at each other from one end to the other and be heard . 
and we thought that was important instead of getting swallowed up in something that you know . 
see , when you have kids , you like to be able to ,
that's true . 
but , i have been watching these houses go up 
and i don't , well , 
somebody was telling me , 
i know somebody who lives back there , 
i have always questioned the quality of construction 
and i don't think they exceed more than twelve nails per house . 
when you watch them go up , you are just amazed that they do not fall over . 
and it takes them something like , thirty days to complete a house . 
oh , that's amazing . 
right now , in fact , even as we speak , we are having a deck put on in back , 
and these guys are phenomenal . 
they are doing such a terrific job back there , 
i mean , you know , you pay for it too , 
but it's like , really worth it . 
they are putting in a deck ,
and it's just , they are doing such a fine , fine job . 
we have got 
i'm really excited about it , 
and , uh , the house is built around the trees . 
and with these decking that a corporation and a large   area for the trees to come up 
so , it's real , real shady . 
 but , that's one of the few things that really , uh , immediately pays back on return . 
but , what i was going to tell you , these perry homes back there , 
when the people from m c i come down 
and you know , they are used to the virginia area , metropolitan d c . 
my god , they come down here and those houses , that look the colonial look what the , 
and , uh , the idea of ever owning anything that has four thousand square feet in it , for less than two hundred twenty thousand dollars ,
must be a dream . 
 because  those things are selling like hot cakes . 
but , one of the people that was living back there was telling me that there is his air conditioning bill , per month , last summer was in excess of five hundred dollars 
and i thought , 
i can't    , 
   and he was talking about how you keep up with the utilities here . 
he has no insulation , probably . 
it's because insulation in those things . 
oh , my . 
what a trap . huh . 
any yet , you know , 
they show very well unless you have , you know , lived in a lot of houses around the area ,
and you ask the right questions and can research , 
and i think that makes a big difference . 
but , i like this area 
and everything that i have been saying , 
 oh , i do too . 
i think if we had to sell now , we could come close to breaking even .
but , still , um , it's worth it for the area and for the school and things like that .
you're in the , 
i think that plano has really done a fantastic job . 
i mean , at least their plans are good . 
um , however , i was , 
maybe you saw in the paper this morning that , um , they've had some problems with ,
with the plastic . 
i thought that was most interesting . 
well , it started out as a good program . *[[two utts ?
and i , 
that's right . 
i guess that's going to happen . 
a really good effort , 
that's right , 
but , uh , 
well , i was thinking about oh , many , many years ago when we were first married and he was in graduate school in missouri , um , i went , oh , 
this was probably , 
 see , it have  been like nineteen sixtyseven or sixtyeight , um , 
i went to a meeting , 
and , uh , one of the speakers at the meeting was a woman who was recycling 
and , um , 
and she had this fantastic , um , family effort in recycling , 
and she was dividing her colored glass and her plastics ,
but my thought was it's a shame , 
i mean , it's wonderful that she's doing it 
but wouldn't it be much nicer if we all did it , 
because her effort would have really , um , really , uh , been a good example for all of us . 
 you know , and we were just sort of talking about it at the time . 
and here we are , you know , 
now we're doing it on a ,
doing it .
so it's wonderful that we've come that far , i think 
but , *[[slash error
what did she do with , 
if she , 
was she like a group that was doing it , 
or was she doing it on her own , 
i think she was , 
i was trying to remember , 
it seems to me that she was doing it on her own , and living in saint louis , 
there were places where she could actually take her ,
and so it wasn't , you know , something that was being picked up 
 um , and i think she was encouraging other people to do it if they would . 
but i remember her saying yes , i have a trash can for this and a trash can for that , and a trash can for the other thing , 
you have to really want to do it , though . 
this is , 
even what you recycle , 
because the , plastics and the , 
um , and , of course , then , you know , you try to buy right too , 
sure you do , 
we had neighbors that complained when we got the new garbage cans . 
isn't that amazing ? 
well , you know , 
people , i don't know , they find fault in everything , rather than say this is a good effort . 
rather than work with it . 
i don't know . 
i know what you're saying , 
kind of people like that 
well , it's for everybody's benefit . 
i mean , it's not , 
so maybe we don't realize it in our lifetime , 
but you have to think grandchildren ,
it's on down the line . 
 and i have a real concern about that . 
i agree . 
we've never had much trash , 
because while 
i was raised in a big family , 
but they weren't rich  , 
and they had to recycle . 
and , you know , the fu , 
well , they didn't , 
they just used things , 
they didn't ,
well , i know , um , 
i guess i got a good example from my mother , 
because she was always very , very conscientious about recycling things , 
and she is to this day , 
and , you know , i mean , she'll even , 
um , if she , 
for instance , she would take the waxed paper out of a cereal box and use that for , you know , when she made cookies , 
it would go on that 
she recycles everything . 
and i have done the same thing . 
i recycle like zip lock bags and ,
my kids get the biggest kick out of that . 
although , they do the same thing .
i mean , they 
but i think they know that that's , 
they've picked up the hab , 
well , they do , 
and when they actually get out away from the home ,
and they appreciate how much it costs to do that . 
that's right . 
well , i don't know , you know . 
to make this whole thing work . i mean , the extra like washing out bottles and jars , or the extra of actually , uh , making sure that , uh , you take stuff over to , you know , 
some people now are complaining because the stuff isn't picked up at the curbside , you know , 
you know , people are not , 
well , see , this is what concerns me . 
over in europe they don't have the kind of waste we do here . 
that's right . 
you've got to be in a country , 
even in mexico ,
i mean , what we throw away is a ransom , a king's ,
and i , 
and even to people in our country ,
you can't tell a person that lives in a hundred , two hundred , three hundred thousand dollar house that have all that they need ,
very pos , 
you know , people didn't like him . 
because he tried to say ,
do those little things , 
 and , uh , 
that make a lot of difference , 
i , you know , 
i think that it has to really hit home before ,
or you have to grow up with it being important in your life ,
and , um , i don't know , 
even myself , than i used to be ,
i mean , like um , to the u t d , um , cafeteria for lunch sometimes 
 and they use styrofoam plates , when they wouldn't ,
you know , and i think to myself that's crazy . 
i wonder if , you know , maybe i need to bring that to someone's attention , you know , 
and , uh , i'm seeing more and more of that , 
of styrofoam , uh , boxes that they use ,
i think is a good example , you know , that even ,
i think the big question too we're looking at is , would you be willing to pay more for a product ,
well , i think that's kind of what it's coming to , i'm sure . 
that's right 
oh , yeah . 
that's right , 
 and i don't , 
with the mind set of the american public , i think what they will do is start paying mexico 
 that doesn't   , 
or they will go dump it out in the middle of some ocean . 
that's the way we solve problems . 
and unfortunately . 
and it's sad . 
well , hal , uh , what's crime like in dallas ? 
well , it depends where in dallas you are . 
there are certainly parts of town i would not want to live in . 
because it's the situation 
it is very location dependent 
 and there are parts of town here where , when they talk about the nightly gunfire . 
oh , yeah . 
in baltimore we have similar . 
uh , i live on the outskirts of baltimore 
and , uh , we live right outside the city 
and our neighborhood is pretty much working class people , though i'm in graduate school , uh , 
i live here because it's close to the university . 
but , you know , we have , uh , 
it's really funny , 
the only crime we really see is , uh , just the kids being malicious . 
you know , and i think most of that is because their parents aren't around . 
what they call the latchkey children . 
something like that . 
no one's , you know , 
or fathers are just missing , you know , 
so there's uh , no consistency there in the home or whatever . 
there's no one to tell them what's right and what's wrong , you know . 
  sort of  on my end is more of the upper middle class 
not that we don't have a certain amount of local problems 
 but on the other hand , uh , we get the , uh , affect of uh , the city 
and , uh , the main crimes within the suburb here are the theft crimes .
uh , well , if we have one murder a year 
but then , you know , you go into dallas and they are , unfortunately 
i think we're about the same in baltimore . 
though , uh , washington , i think is , uh , close by 
and , you know , they experience a lot more . 
i think they definitely have more problems in the area . 
what do you think can prevent crime ? 
well , the thing is , i don't , 
it's one of those things where , if you're a grad student you can appreciate the statistics on 
unfortunately there are often these correlations that are inverse of what they should be like , uh , wherever there are more , uh , criminals , there are more policemen 
 but that's which came first . 
but , on the other side of it is 
in the society 
and , well , uh , since now i'm in my midforties , when i was in grad school or when i was an undergraduate growing up in a more rural area 
i think , i agree with you there . 
because it just was not , uh , something back in the sixties that 
but i think , you know , that there is a lot in the society where things have changed , 
uh , so it's effected all of us . 
i think uh , is one of the main problems . 
he's one of the big proponents of that . 
he gets on national television and says that , you know . 
so it's , uh  , 
and he was becoming mayor . 
so that's a really stran , 
you know , it's a different viewpoint . 
i , uh , 
you know , in a sense i have real mixed feelings on that 
 because it comes a bit from the angle that the , uh , uh , 
it would certainly be an interesting test 
 but the other side of it , to me , 
what happens if we lose worse . 
uh , y , 
well , the other side is that unfortunately some of the down side , 
and i think if i look back fifty or a hundred years i'd say , you know , back then there were the opium dens 
 but the thing is , if somebody ruined their life , uh , society didn't try to then save themselves from it , 
they let this person who had ruined it 
i mean 
but now we tend to believe somewhere in the health care system otherwise , 
we need to take care of people even if they have , you know , physically ruined themselves . 
they have induced it themselves . 
that's true . 
 and so , to me that's , 
of making drugs real cheap 
well i think 
but i never heard results or anything like that , 
so i never , you know , 
plus , uh , you know , it really couldn't be a good test because alaska's so different than every other part of the country . 
you know , but that was interesting , you know , 
i don't , 
crime is one of those things that's , uh , 
i don't know , you know , 
the drug culture , 
uh , the , uh , you know , 
i see it with the kids in the neighborhood just stealing things , not thinking anything wrong with it . 
well , some of that , 
and , of course , i'm a baby of the old school 
 but , it bothers me from the fifties on , 
not that i'd remember that much 
but basically we have so much more of the something for nothing mentality . 
that's true . 
we worked hard for everything . 
that's very true . 
and so they 
in the , 
there were the sixtyfour thousand dollar question shows in the fifties , 
but nowadays , there's so much on tv where people seem to have the idea they can get something for nothing . 
of course 
and i see , unfortunately , we have this whole mentality that somehow there are these pots of money out there that you can sue somebody and , you know , there's a million dollars you can have 
but , you know , the other thing that bothers me in the crime is the , uh , 
in europe , they seem to have mentality , 
and drunk driving is a good one , 
is that people are well indoctrinated in their society that drunken driving is unacceptable . 
and , yeah , 
if you're going to drink , and you may drink , you better have your designated driver . 
actually , just caught on . 
my father was hit by a drunk driver when i was in high school 
 and , uh , that was an awful three years afterwards . you know , of recovery 
and , you know , the guy went free because this was twelve years ago 
there was no , 
his father was even , the , uh , police chief of the town . 
so there was no repercussion at all . you know , other than insurance , 
but he was uninsured . 
so , uh , our insurance paid for everything , 
but it was a very difficult time 
a new car 
and somebody had taken like a baseball bat to it 
and they came and questioned us . 
you know , and , 
but , that kind of shows how our attitude toward drinking 
 you know , it was an acceptable social behavior . 
very much so . 
those are some important points . 
those are , 
what does your city have for gun control if anything ? 
well , see maryland is one of the most , 
we just voted in , uh , strong gun control here in the state of maryland . 
i think , 
well , the weather certainly has been hot 
and it's been humid . 
i don't remember a year in a long time that the humidity has stayed up this high uh , this late into , uh , 
well , it's not really late into the summer , 
but the humidity has hung around all of june . 
are you native to this area ? 
oh , okay . 
 uh , but , you know , i know the summers get hot 
this humidity has just really hung on there . 
it seemed like , well , you know , last year was so strange having all those heavy , heavy rains in april 
and this year we really didn't have heavy rains until may . 
kind of like pushed the season back a little farther 
and now it's kind of lingering with kind of still a bit of humidity 
and it just tried to rain , 
i mean , i was coming in from my car just a few minutes ago 
and it was trying to rain which 
normally we don't have too much , uh , humidity or , uh , rainy time when it's past june . 
oh , that's right , 
i can remember it not , 
it's really august that it happens . 
you get those great big cracks in the ground where it's been so dry 
 and it just gets so dry 
 and , the earth opens up . 
i can remember the first year i moved here 
 and it didn't rain , 
i moved here like in late august 
and it didn't rain from august until december 
i mean it was great after growing up in michigan you know , every day was cloudy , 
almost every day was cloudy 
and you sort of forget how much it did rain 
and coming here and then it didn't rain , 
it was just wonderful . 
well , yeah , 
see i lived in , uh , ohio mainly . 
i lived in , uh , pontiac just a little while before i came 
oh , yeah . 
and , you know , so many times when you were trying to schedule outdoor activities , you just never knew if it was going to be a go or not because of the weather . 
it might rain on your little parade . 
that's right , 
you know , and here it was like , pretty much you could schedule some activity outside anytime 
and you really didn't have too much of a chance of it getting rained out . 
you could pretty much do whatever you wanted to do . 
that's right . 
what part of michigan were you living in ? 
oh , i grew up in dearborn 
you probably know where that is because i know where pontiac is , 
what brought you down here ? 
oh , a teaching job . 
so you teach in plano schools ? 
so , i'm home with two children , 
new career . 
but , uh , anyway , 
so that kind of , uh , 
well , i had been down here to visit 
so i   school and said hey , let's , you know , find a place that has a nice job 
and , uh , that's how it worked out . 
well , yeah , 
i think a lot of people were , uh , leaving michigan all about the time i came here in the early eighties 
and it seemed like it was almost a mass exodus . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , the little joke about , will the last person leaving michigan just turn out the light .
oh , well , it's a nice place , you know , 
i mean that's a nice place , though . 
well , you know , i said i lived in , uh , the pontiac . 
i didn't live in the city of pontiac , 
i lived to the west of it . 
uh , i forget the county , 
but you know where all the lakes are around there . 
sort of . 
i lived in an apartment complex on one of the lakes . 
it was real close to where i worked . 
it was only like four miles to work 
and it was wonderful being on the lake like that . 
you know , in the summer , you feel like you're , you know , on a vacation all the time because you're right on a lake 
and everybody's , you know , out enjoying the water and such , 
and , uh , in the winter time the lakes froze over , 
you could still kind of go sledding and such out there 
but i thought it was just really neat to be out there on all those lakes . 
there's lots of really small ones out there . 
you know , like maybe a mile , two long . 
that's enough to , uh , do some boating 
that's right . 
 and it was lots of fun . 
that's right . 
well , i think it's toward ann arbor , 
so it's probably out in that direction , 
but that's the only one i probably could name 
but it was , yeah , just lots of little lakes 
and , of course , it was , you know , a little more expensive to live on the lake , 
but i just thought that was grand . 
and i think a lot of people didn't really know that there were all those lakes out there unless you were from that area and kind of spotted them , 
but there was quite a few lakes all around there . 
it was almost like you were living on an island 
there was so much water around where i was . 
 i said  i wasn't close to downtown pontiac , 
i was way out to the west maybe four or five miles from the city limits 
and it was really nice out there . 
we had , uh , pine knob 
so there were things around there . 
really was pretty nice . 
and isn't that where they have a summer music festival there , too ? 
in the summertime they have musicals there 
and in the winter time they make snow and have a ski slope . 
that's right , 
i know , we used to , 
we didn't do a lot of it , 
but we did . 
so those are always fun . 
and alpine , was it alpine was another ski slope 
i always tell people that in the winter we used to , uh , 
my dad would kind of bank up the snow in the backyard and turn the hose on , you know , make a pond in the backyard for us . 
oh , yeah , 
 but , uh , you know , we probably did some ice skating on it , 
but then it chipped 
and , you know , it would melt or whatever and get pretty uneven 
we used to have a 
christmas time , uh , some of our relatives would come up from alabama , 
and i think most times we would have snow around christmas 
and the kids when they were young would just go nuts . 
you know , because they were from alabama where it never snowed 
 and they just had a grand time watching the snow and getting out there and playing in it , you know , eternally . 
oh , right , 
if only it would make nice snow here in texas , we'd be okay at christmas time . 
my first winter here , 
i came down in , uh , early eightytwo 
and there was just a freak snowfall early one morning in december couple days before christmas . 
it lasted only a few hours , 
and i remember getting up and somebody telling me , hey , better wait to go to work because the roads are all , you know , snow .
ha ha . 
and there was , but a very short time 
and the weather got warm so quick 
it just melted it all away . 
i know . 
course , when we get an ice storm , that's not too much fun . 
that's not fun either , 
so , uh , i just as soon have all the slushy snow on the streets than have the ice on the streets 
our house is kind of on a little hill , 
so , uh , we get the sled out 
and , uh , the kids go down the hill on the sleds when it's icy , 
i mean they just go down the ice . 
i think we must be the only people on the block that make use of that cold weather and get out there . 
oh , yeah . 
i think it's fun , 
even the couple of ice storms i've gotten out there in my ski pants or something and still just been out and enjoying it a little bit . 
i mean , sometimes the ice is pretty bad , 
but if you get on the , the , uh , grassy kind of part , you get a little bit of traction , you know , not slip and fall . 
i mean , first , 
i really haven't seen any movies lately , 
but , i think i haven't been to the movie theater here in about , oh , six months , 
but , uh , you know , the last movies that i've seen were probably on video . 
oh , well that's , 
we rent a lot of videos 
uh , we saw , 
i have two little babies 
and we saw one movie recently 
and that was the terminator 
now i haven't seen the terminator movie , 
i don't particularly care for that sort of stuff . 
well , i don't either . 
on all the advertisements arnold schwarzenegger says he doesn't kill anybody in the movie . 
he doesn't . 
he maims them .
uh , i think he shoots off their knee caps for the most part .
i saw , uh , sleeping with the enemy . 
oh , i haven't seen that one yet . 
oh , couple weeks ago i rented it and , uh , watched it 
and i was pretty disappointed in it 
because i was told by several people that it's pretty scary and intense 
 and i was pretty disappointed in it . 
now it's a good movie , 
but , i guess that they built me up too much .
i haven't , 
that's one we want to see . 
i want to see , uh , dances with wolves . 
but , we haven't seen that one yet , either . 
now i haven't seen it either , 
but , uh , i've heard that it's real long . that it's a good movie , but it's long , like three hours . 
that's what i heard , too . 
we've got to get it at a time when we can put our kids to bed and stay up late 
that's right . 
that's right . 
oscar . 
supposed to be uh , his debut in comedy . 
which was an interesting movie , but not very funny . 
i know my daughter saw that 
and she liked it 
did she ? 
well , it was an amusing movie . 
it j ,  , 
i guess maybe it would have been better if we'd have been at the theater 
and , of course , i get to watch all these movies like look who's talking and look who's talking , too 
 because i have a ten year old 
my son just turned two 
and so the little mermaid is now our favorite movie . 
we seen the little mermaid , too . 
little mermaid and peter pan 
and i think there's some good disney movies fixing to come out on video , uh , shipwrecked . 
oh , i didn't hear that was coming out . 
and , boy , i can't think of the other one that's fixing to come out . 
well , they just had 
i think i heard that was just out . 
uh , he doesn't sit still for the whole movie , yet , 
well , i'm glad to know that there's somebody else out there that doesn't get to go to the movie theater .
well , i tell you , ever s , 
my kids are just small babies 
and , i tell you , we really want to go 
and , uh , there's so much out on video now , that it's almost , you know , 
the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it .
that seems to happen . 
i noticed that dances with wolves was playing at the , uh , granada theater . 
and , uh , someone said that was a lot of fun to go do . 
you can have dinner and everything while you watch the movie . 
i thought that might be kind of fun to do . 
that does sound fun . 
and , of course , you need a babysitter for that .
but , uh , no , 
i'd really like to get out to the movies more often . 
course , it's so expensive , now , too 
i know we get discount tickets 
but , other than that it just seems like it's so expensive . 
and then the popcorn and everything else , 
you almost can't afford to do it .
that's right . 
although we did actually get , 
we went on vacation couple months ago , 
and we got to go see what about bob ? 
that was kind of a funny movie with , uh , richard dreyfuss and bill murray . 
that was fun . 
i don't think that i've ever heard of that movie . 
oh , richard dreyfuss is a , uh , psychiatrist 
and bob is his patient 
and bob follows him on vacation . 
it's , uh , 
oh , that's the one where they burn down the house or something 
the house explodes ? 
oh , okay . 
another movie that i want to see if it ever comes out on video so i can see it without my daughter around is , uh , oh , 
i just forgot the title of it . 
uh , darn , 
well , here's another one that i've seen . 
i saw , uh , 
i can't remember the title of it , either .
must have left an impression . 
how would you feel about sending an elderly family member to a nursing home ? 
well , i don't feel very good about it , 
but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do . 
we sent my grandfather to a nursing home at the point when he was really incapable of caring for himself anymore . 
he actually died a few months after that , 
and so as , 
at least in retrospect , it was the right thing to do 
because he was either in a nursing home or a hospital 
and what type of recommendations did you have when you decided where to place him ? 
um , well , the , see , uh , well , 
he wanted to get into a mennonite nursing home which is very popular and hard to get into and had like a ten year waiting list 
oh , my . 
we wound up just choosing another mennonite nursing home that was easier to get into . 
but naturally , 
it was even mennonite related , 
i'm sorry , it was actually not a particularly great nursing home . 
mostly the thing was that it was available when we needed it ,
 so the convenience , 
uh , what do you think ? 
my grandmother lived with us , um , until august , um , 
and we made the decision to put her in a nursing home . 
she has leukemia 
 and the rest of her family and her regular doctors and everybody she trusted and knew was in dayton , and were several thousand miles away 
 so i made the decision to put her in a nursing home , 
and my sister being on the other end found one that she could have what was called an independent living facility . 
she had her own little room and didn't have to share it with anyone and could bring in her own chair and t v set 
that's important 
and the other major factor is that she needs blood transfusions every week to ten days , and would have to be hospitalized a day or two , 
so in this facility they can do it right there from her own room 
 so she didn't have to be transported back and forth . 
so , she's been there since august the thirteenth and seems to have adjusted pretty well . 
it's not her favorite place to be in . 
she'd much rather be here with me . 
and i've got little children here who needed me here 
she needed somebody to watch her twentyfour hours a day . 
she was falling down and hemorrhaging 
and , you know , all kinds of physical problems , 
so it just became too much for me to handle , 
even though i would have liked to have had her stay , with her health being what it was she couldn't 
we tried to convince my grandfather to live with us at several points during the last few years of his life , 
but he was essentially too proud and too independent 
 but he was living alone , had an upstairs apartment , could barely make it up the steps 
and this , 
eventually things just went too far 
 and he allowed himself to be put into a nursing home . 
well , i think sometimes when people get to be a certain age , other people have to kind of help them make decisions . 
it sure wouldn't have been granny's decision to leave us and go back to a nursing home , 
but she's accepted it real well now 
 well yeah , that's right that the children have some responsibility , too , to their parents and such , to help decide what's the right thing . 
well , we enjoyed 
but we feel she's much safer where she is now . 
she still continues to fall , 
but when she does a nurse is right there to help her 
 and i know she's eating the right things , 
and her doctor's right there where he can come in and check on her , 
so . it became dangerous for us to keep transporting her back and forth in the car because she was so wobbly and needed a walker or a wheel chair 
 so , i think she'll adjust , 
you know 
um , if it was formal i'd probably go with something like a chicken breast or lasagna or something . 
i'm not into formal dinner parties , 
i see . 
so what do you use for cookbooks ? 
 um , i have a pillsbury cookbook i got when i was married , 
but , it's kind of the bible of cooking 
then i have some from like church that are more family recipes that are more useful .
um , i cook a lot the same as my mom did , 
of course i've added several 
but , what you serve or what would you  , 
well , from different backgrounds , uh , 
so the , 
well , that's good .
so , it diff , you know , 
have different perspectives that you are . 
i find the joy of cooking to be a remarkably useful book 
because it has almost everything in it . 
but on the other hand , it's not very inspiring , uh , 
it's a good reference when you need to dig something up . 
what we've found very useful is a book called the thirty minute cookbook , 
i think that's the title , by marion burroughs 
 uh , which has recipes which allegedly can all be prepared in thirty minutes , you know , the whole meal 
 and so she's 
that would be wonderful in these times .
now , now , i find that the cutting up of the food , and all that really makes it take a little longer than thirty minutes . 
but they're interesting 
what's one of your favorites ? 
um , gee , 
the one i had most recently ha , 
she describes as jim beard's favorite , um , summer menu , or something , 
and it consisted of grilled kielbasa sausage 
sounds too good . 
uh , that's certain you can do in thirty minutes . 
but there are a whole lot of , you know , 
i mean , i would recommend you look at that book 
that thirty minute cookbook . 
thirty minute cookbook . 
that sounds fun . 
i find a lot of the cookbooks i don't know , that you buy over the counter ask for really strange ingredients , or things i don't keep on hand all the time 
 and i have young children , 
and our budget's set , you know , at this time , 
but i want to use simple recipes that 
i don't have to run to the store to buy or look for something i haven't heard of .
that's why sometimes i shy away from , uh , more of a traditional cookbook 
 but , well , it was interesting talking to you . 
it's a fun subject . 
food is one of my favorite things too . 
anything else you wanted to add ? 
what would i put together for a formal dinner . 
we had some friends over as recently as saturday night 
oh , wow . 
the inspiration was a combination of julia child for the dessert , you know , a chocolate mousse recipe 
that's good . 
basically you're in an open pan , um , having marinated it first 
and , my wife did this part so i don't remember all the details 
marinated in olive oil and some seasoning , um , and cooked with some olives and some prunes , uh , 
there's a little bit of brown sugar in there , 
and it bakes up 
and it's a delicious thing , 
and it's easy 
that sounds good . 
that sounds really good . 
i just love  , 
it sounds like you guys are a little more gourmet than i am , 
i'm pretty simple right now , 
well , maybe a little more leisure time 
i don't know , 
 that's true , 
i have little ones 
 and they won't eat , you know , too many different foods 
i found my kids were very frustrating when they were little 
well , there again , sometimes it was easy , 
they'd , you know , 
canned ravioli was ,
spaghetti's a pretty 
 and it goes a long ways too . 
well , nice talking to you cheryl . 
talk to you later maybe . 
do you have children ? 
uh , yes . 
uh , one's a freshman in college 
and one's a sophomore in high school . 
and you ? 
i have one that's a freshman in high school , a daughter . and a son who's a sixth grader in a middle school . 
and i spend most of my time carpooling .
the story of my life .
my kids are involved in sports . 
my daughter has played basketball for six years , 
and my son plays football . 
my rule is that they can't play a sport the same time of the year  ,
 uh , well , uh , yeah . 
we did spend a lot of time , uh , 
it really helped when the , uh , older one was old enough to get his license and could , uh 
i know , 
i know . 
the insurance . 
but , uh , i , uh , fo , 
for one thing . 
uh , but yeah , 
uh , we do 
but our two had , uh , totally different interests of , 
but there was not much , uh , overlap as such . 
was not at all into , uh , sports for the most part . 
uh , he participated 
band and , uh , scouts were his two big things . 
my son ,
and he's playing ,
oh , gee . 
so , uh , yeah , 
we spend a lot of time , uh , uh , carpooling that they do . 
but then , uh , we also  didn't trying to , 
uh , you know , just family time . 
uh , we had a , 
at a fairly young age we started teaching them to play games and card games and so forth . 
uh , uh , but we didn't , uh , do it as much or as often as , uh , i would have liked to . 
i would like to do that as a family and , 
what about you ? 
we found this oriental  tile  game called  mahjongg  .
i've heard of that . 
have you ? 
i've never actually played it . 
well , it's really fun . 
um , one of my neighbors moved here from memphis 
and a lot of them played it , 
and she started a group going in the neighborhood 
and my kids wanted to learn how to play it 
and it's more fun with four people . 
and it's a game that none of their friends know how to play , 
and they both enjoy it . 
so if they want to play , they have to play with mom and dad . 
so , uh , we play that a lot of them , 
and , uh , we like to go miniature golfing and to movies . 
we have family that lives outside of the state 
so we go visit both sets of grandparents and take car trips . 
so do we . 
so , that , 
and my husband and son go camping 
my daughter and i hate camping so we go shopping . 
so that just kind of works out real well . 
and , um , i'm a writer by profession 
and my daughter enjoys writing too , 
so a lot of times , she and i will travel to writers conferences together . 
oh , now that's neat . 
we've never had anything 
so that gives us special time together too . 
and she's on the yearbook staff and things like that 
so i can help her with that 
and she gives me ideas for my writing too 
 oh , well , good . 
well , in terms of any sorts of trends i , you know , 
and my children than when i was growing up . 
i grew up on a farm , uh , in iowa , 
and , uh , you know the whole family was around the whole time . 
and then what my father did you know , obvious to me 
and i helped out with it . 
but , uh , although i have brought my boys to see where i work , it's not that easy , 
and it's certainly not at all common , 
and they just don't really have that same idea , 
so they , uh , 
it's a whole different , uh , kind of thing there then , uh , 
my husband has taken us to work with him , 
and we still don't know what he does . 
so , we just say he travels a lot . 
so , that kind of covers it . 
well , that makes it hard though in terms of , you know , family time with , 
i've been lucky in that respect that i uh , don't travel too much   .
he's been on temporary duties where he's been gone nine months . 
so those are the real killers . 
if he's just gone , 
he's gone three weeks right now 
and that's mild compare to the big ones , 
so and handle whatever needs to be done . 
and something major ,
and hopefully he won't have too many surprises when he gets home . 
well , let's see . 
so what , 
as far as i'm  , 
well , the thing i think that annoys me the most is , i have young children , a baby in the house 
and inevitably as soon as they're asleep , someone calls on the phone trying to sell me something . 
and i think that , that is probably the most aggravating .
uh , you know , it invades my time . 
i'm the one that pays for the phone . 
uh , if i want to buy something , i'll take the initiative and go find it , you know . 
and that just really does aggravate me . 
uh , what do you think ? 
well , i mean i , 
that's exactly the kind of thing i would have said . 
although in my case it's my wife and i both work , 
we come home 
and just as we're preparing dinner or eating dinner 
and it's one solicitation call after another 
and , you know . 
your time is 
and , uh , why do we let this happen . 
oh , i , 
that's interesting . 
the market seems to just be growing , too . 
i guess enough people are not speaking out . 
i'm not speaking out , that's for sure . 
i just get aggravated about it . 
would you , 
i mean if you could legislate something , what would you legislate ? 
i really don't know . 
legislating of a lot of different areas , 
but  , i don't know . 
i do particularly find it annoying . 
uh , i'm really not sure . 
it seems to me that we should have the ability to designate with the phone company that we don't want to receive calls like that . *[[sv
well , yeah , that might , 
 and the people making these calls would be obliged to compare 
identify themselves , yeah . 
well , that would be 
and , that way , those who want it can have it 
and those who don't want it , don't have to have it . 
sort of like an unlisted number where you haven't gone to the trouble of enlisting yourself . 
except even unlisted numbers aren't safe now because they have these things just sort of dial through all the numbers .
oh , is that right ? 
oh , that's interesting . 
and they just get everybody . 
well , i do wish that it would stop on my end 
and is doortodoor 
i don't mind the children when they're selling things for school . 
i have kids 
and , you know , that's just kind of 
but when it's adults selling a variety of things and especially when men arrive at about ten o'clock in the morning 
 and , it's annoying as well . 
find an unoccupied house to rob . 
you really don't know , 
so than i might normally be 
 but , i do feel like it's an invasion of my space . 
and , uh , 
i've never quite understood the purpose of that . 
i , uh , 
well , i think these people were hired from different sources . 
 just be , 
 uh , with , you know , 
and so , therefore , there's no one answer . 
but , yeah 
basically it's a market survey 
just a survey . 
 but they never say 
there have been a couple of times when uh , whatever the subject was , i guess caught my interest and i went along with it 
and then there have been several times when i just said , well , i just really don't have the time , you know 
but , uh , i don't get too many of those . 
i've had just a few . 
uh , generally someone's trying to sell me something 
well , and sometimes this is just the lead in to a sales pitch 
other times it's , you know , wasting your time 
for which , if they would just pay me enough money 
that's right . 
but a dollar isn't it , 
you know , it's , 
uh , and i also sort of worry you know , that sometimes people giveaway personal information . 
uh , and they , uh , you know , sort of seductive , to , you know , 
somebody is asking me my opinion on all of these things , 
and so i start answering 
and then you know , you go down a path 
 uh , and you don't know where it's going to end . 
well , we , 
that's true . 
but it could 
you just never know , i guess . 
and it , 
asking for information is , 
i can't really see that , 
i think if nothing else , they ought to spend money for a postage stamp 
and , you know , when it arrives at your house , oh , i , 
what kind of house do you live in ? 
well , uh , we live in a brick home in far north dallas 
and it's , uh , four bedrooms and three and a half baths and swimming pool in the back 
well , it sounds like ours are pretty similar . 
i live in one , 
i don't have a swimming pool . 
and mine's about twentyseven hundred square foot . 
but the four bedrooms 
and all the rest of it sounds just  , about alike . 
i think it's pretty much typical for this area . 
it is . 
have you been living there very long ? 
i've been in the house 
i'm in here right now about twelve and a half years . 
so you've been there longer . 
we built this one about , uh , 
and we subcontracted it out ourselves . 
we bought 
oh , really ? 
 and then we subbed it out , 
so , we've been here a little over six years now . and 
well , i bet you , 
my husband got his big garage . 
we have a three car garage , that he has a big work area in 
 and he likes to rebuild cars and redo engines 
and , so he has all the work space he needs . 
well , that sounds interesting . 
i bet he's enjoyed having it that way 
 because some , 
kind of hard to find one prebuilt that kind of fits those specifications . 
it is , 
and that's why we decided to build . 
we looked 
and was large , it seemed like the garages were small even if they were three car garages which is 
well , then , most 
they're kind of rare . 
so we put a three car garage in . 
but , even if they had three car garages , they didn't have a work space . 
all of it was taken up with just car space . 
and so he has a big landing area that's between where the cars are in the garage and where the house starts 
well that , 
we've just got a two car garage , 
but my husband's got a big space in between where the cars are and the house , where he has a big work shop , you know , workbench and everything . 
well , sounds like our husbands have similar interests . 
now , mine does not work on cars , 
he just piddles on this and that . 
oh , i see . 
but he likes to have a spot to keep all of his piddling things . 
well , that's nice that it's not in your house . 
it really is . 
because , you know , they have a lot of things of their own , 
and you know , i wouldn't mind having , 
and i at one time was going to fix up when one of my daughters left , a bedroom to where i had a room to just put all of my craft stuff and 
but someone , 
i don't know , 
it ended up i got some furniture back that one of them had moved out or something . 
so i didn't end up with my vacant room like i had thought i would . 
well , we still have a son and daughter in college that come home . 
and the other room we use as a guest bedroom because my husband's family come . 
his parents come 
and also the kids have friends who come 
and so 
well , i still , 
all three of my daughters are married , 
but , i don't know , 
i just still have need for the four bedrooms just having company from time to time .
oh , i understand .
and we've got grandchildren now , 
well , we , 
that's true 
and you don't want them to not be able to come because there's no room . 
that's right , 
you sure don't . 
at times i keep thinking , though , that might be kind of nice . 
i've heard people say that . 
but , uh , my middle son is engaged , 
my oldest son has been going with the same girl for a while . 
he's out of college 
so he could afford to get married 
and my daughter's been going with the same boy for a while , 
but she's still in college 
and we're just as happy for her to finish 
well , i don't blame you for that . 
so , i hope so . 
well , i have the three girls 
and then we ended up with four grandsons . 
oh , hoho . 
and little boys are around the house 
a whole new world . 
and , uh , i enjoy them coming , but for short doses .
i can understand . 
it feels , 
after they've been here ten minutes , they have already explored the entire house , 
they know everything . 
but , they're fun . 
so you're all back to the safety catches and the whole nine yards or either watching them every minute . 
well , i just watch them . 
i never did put things up when my kids were little 
and i haven't with them . 
i try to teach them not to get into things . 
well , that's the same thing that i did . 
i hope i'll be able to do the same with grandchildren . 
i think that once you do that , your children kind of develop the same attitudes . 
at least my daughters have . 
they try to teach theirs not to get into things instead of having to put everything up . 
so it's worked pretty well . 
i don't really think anything's been broken . 
every now and then we have to kind of go and say , now don't bother this  , you know . 
um , uhhuh .
but , all in all , they mind pretty well . 
but , i guess most of the hou , 
what kind of roof does your house have ? 
well , we have , 
oh , really . 
oh , no , 
well , i think at this point , i for one am worried about every aspect .
especially , uh , you , since you're in the same metroplex , 
you know , there's so much going on here . 
i think the drive by shootings are getting to be so common , that's really something you got to protect yourself from . 
well , that , and in the schools , too 
i know . 
have they done that in garland ? 
now , um , 
i just heard , you know , last week at that one school , they started putting them in because there was that one shooting 
 so , um , 
well , we had a vice principal shot at here 
is that right ? 
and the one boy killed himself a few years ago , in a grade school , 
so . yeah , 
it's kind of scary to think , you send your child to school 
and you wonder if he's going to get shot . 
i mean , we didn't have to worry about that before . 
i know .
what next ? 
i know , 
it's getting , 
it's been out of hand , i think , for a while , 
and it just continues to get worse . 
and , you know , we can't really depend on the police to solve all this , 
they just can't do it . 
i think it goes all the way back to the break up of the family 
uh , and how we going to bring that back together . 
i thi , 
i agree , 
i think that's where it stems from , is that and , um , you know , you've got a lot more women that are working nowadays 
 and that may impact it as well . 
i think so , 
and then there's a drop in , uh , the training of morals , really , you know . 
some of these young kids you read about , just doesn't bother them to kill someone at all 
i think 
they don't think twice about it . 
either that or i don't know if it happened and it wasn't as highly publicized as it is now , or what the , 
i think it was just rare , 
i really do . 
my mother , well , she's like seventyfour now . 
when she was a young girl , she had a beautiful , beautiful cousin that lived in california , 
and she was dating this millionaire's son 
and he wanted to marry her , 
and she wouldn't marry him 
and so he drove out in the country one day and shot them both , 
and , uh , 
you're kidding . 
i'm the one , 
himself and her ? 
oh , wow , 
i bet . 
 but now , you know , you wouldn't probably read about it here in texas 
oh , i know , 
it's just , you know , another killing . 
well , they were , 
i was watching some show the other day , 
and they were talking about , uh , mass murderers 
 and they brought up what happened in killeen here recently , 
lots of their picture and life story and everything . 
and then you get to their life story , 
oh , they came from a broken family 
 oh this person had mental problems 
 oh duh , duh , duh 
i know , how we   straighten up all these twisted people before they do something terrible , 
so , uh , that story i just told you about my mother's beautiful cousin , well , the same thing happened here in arlington , when was it , i think oh , it was almost a year ago in december to a girl that my daughter had graduated from high school with . 
is that right ? 
she was a real attractive blond girl , in her freshman year of college 
 and some boy she tried to get rid of , he was like in his twenties , 
uh , i remember seeing that , 
remember that ? 
that's , uh , 
my daughter graduated with her from arlington high school . 
is that right ? 
can you believe it , 
that's just , uh , 
i'm trying to remember , 
he , um , had her in the car in front of a taco   or something 
taco bueno , 
 and he just shot them 
i remember seeing that . 
yeah , uh , uh , 
isn't that weird ? 
i know , 
and , uh , the police are not going to do anything until they've committed some sort of a crime . 
you know , he was just begging her on the phone , 
that's not doing anything . 
and there are times i think , gee , i   should give my kids gu , 
  not be a very good conversationalist on fishing . 
i don't do a lot of it . 
well , i do love to fish . 
well good , 
maybe i can learn something . 
i'm not so sure i'm good at it , 
but i do enjoy doing it . 
do you ? 
well , it is fun , what little i do . 
of course , i don't , you know , 
i think when they refer to different kinds of fishing 
i told my husband last night when i had called and they had , told me that this was a topic , i said , well , i can tell them how to fish with a minnow or how to fish with a worm .
well , i hope it is , 
there's not a whole lot of different kinds . 
that's about the only kind i know how to do . 
i don't do a lot of deep sea fishing , 
 because i get seasick , 
 and i do a lot of fishing for , uh , bass . 
we have a just filled with good sized bass . 
and then when i get tired of them outwitting me , i fish for catfish 
 and we use worms and shiners , which is pretty much like minnows 
and then i also use spinner baits and plastic worms . 
it all depends on what i'm fishing for , and the time of day . 
well , it sounds like you do quite a bit of it . 
i do . 
uh , there's a lake like maybe two or three miles from here , 
fishing's a good way to do that , 
and i have a lot of friends who like to go fishing . 
do you have a boat ? 
i have a friend who has a little inflatable raft , 
and we 
i wish i had a boat , 
but i don't . 
i think the lakes are probably different in michigan than they are in texas . 
the ones around here are so big , that you can fish off the dock 
 but unless you have a boat you can't really get into where they call the good fishing holes , you know . 
is it ? 
my inlaws live on a lake , uh , a little bit east of dallas , kind of in the piney woods , 
and the lake is beautiful , 
and i like to go out and stand at the end of the dock and fish , 
but actually catching fish to eat per se , you don't really do much of that right there . 
i catch a lot of little old , uh , i think they call them perch 
 and then the , uh , turtles try to eat up all my bait .
so it's so close to the dock that i think all i do is feed them a little bit 
we don't have , 
 but it's kind of fun . 
but we do have a awful lot of snakes in our lakes . 
and i , 
do they ever get on your hook ? 
we , uh , 
occasionally i'll catch an eel 
they just kind of , 
are they poisonous snakes ? 
uh , we have a lot of cotton mouth , 
so yes 
 and they live in little coves that i like to fish in , 
so i seem them swimming by every once in a while . 
i think i'd be a little bit afraid of those . 
they're certainly ugly . 
we , uh , saw a large snake right off the dock there at my inlaws' place last year . 
it was probably four inches in diameter or something like that you know . 
great big snake , 
and of course , it scared the women to death , you know , 
but it looked so bad 
 and it was so big , that it might not would have hurt us , 
but we sure felt like it was hurting us , just being there , you know .
but they're scary looking . 
do you have bass ? 
yes , uh , 
well , that's pretty much the same way here . 
now , they have a lot of bass tournaments . 
well , we have those . 
i don't 
 inevitably , if i enter one of those , i never catch a thing . 
oh , no . 
i just go out there and sit and watch other people do it . 
well that's kind of , 
we've never entered a tournament or anything . 
we're not that big into fishing , 
but i see a lot of people , 
you know , early in the morning there'll be all the boats going out , 
and they'll say , well , there's a big bass tournament this weekend , 
and all those people are here for the tournament , you know . 
oh , yes . 
so i think there's a lot of people that have , you know , i guess that you'd call it really sport fishing , 
they're really into it to try to win . 
oh , definitely . 
certainly here they are . 
but a very relaxing sport to be able to just be out on the water and looking around . 
the peace and calmness is really relaxing . 
it's a good thing to take a nice book and sit back and read and fish . 
that's what i do a lot . 
i've never tried taking a book with me . 
i'll have to try that one of these days . 
this is donna donahue . 
hi , donna . 
well , what did you have for lunch ? 
oh , uh , it was , 
i'm an officer in the air force , 
well , that's interesting . 
is that , 
if you're having a dinner party , what would you serve ? 
okay , uh , 
do you want me to go first ? 
if i was having a dinner party i would probably , um , have uh , um , some fruit to start with with some apples sliced up and maybe some cheddar cheese and crackers and grapes and , um , probably serve maybe some wine and beer and maybe have some , uh , uh , salsa and chips around and peanuts . 
and then um , let's see . i usually have like a little theme when i have a dinner party 
and then we'd have , um , like a big greek tossed salad kind of like a caesar salad . 
and , um , let's see what else . 
um , maybe some rolls and , um , i guess some , uh , some rice or something like that . 
how does that sound ? .
 well , when is the party here ? .
 um , yeah , 
that would take some planning 
i don't know 
i mean it's not a question of capability here to do something like that . 
it's just there's no motivation . 
that's right . 
you know , and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that 
but , um , 
well , that sounds good too . 
um , i have three kids 
 so , um , when we have friends over i have my oldest kind of babysit for the little two younger ones upstairs 
and , um , usually we just have very plain kind of , you know , not very interesting meals .
so  once in a while when we do something like that it's kind of fun , 
but it's not a , 
um , let's see now 
well , i live on a lake here , 
uh , so it , 
and then during the summertime it's real nice to be able to entertain outdoors , 
oh , sure . 
like that's a little more a casual thing . 
but in a fireplace and a nice , nice house and all that 
so we ,
oh , that sounds wonderful . 
i just haven't , uh , really tried a whole lot 
but , uh 
let's see . 
 well , one time i did have a dinner party . 
i served a , uh , uh , 
i had a gang of people over and kind of made a fried chicken thing and biscuits ,
oh , you are in new york right now ? 
i'm in texas . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , i see . 
it is . 
and i'm originally from long island . 
oh , no kidding ? 
and now where are you in new york ? 
oh , upstate . 
in , uh , 
oh , okay . 
oh , okay . 
is that where you are originally from around there ? 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , been all over the place . 
oh , wow . 
that's interesting . 
let's see . 
um , well , um , sometimes when i have a dinner party i'll have , um , everybody bring something , 
and that's real interesting because then you get um , different kinds of foods and new recipes 
and , um , uh , sometimes somebody will be bring something that you really like , 
and get the recipe from them or whatever . 
and we are just getting interested in mexican food 
because here in texas they have lots of ,
do you know what a fajita is ? 
i've been down to texas a few times ,
they have some delicious , delicious things , 
and i , um , 
since i always make chicken burritos and just 
and you boil them , maybe like four chicken breasts , 
and you boil them until they are cooked .
and then you debone them and kind of shred them up into the meat  that has gotten  cooled 
and you take , um , in a big frying pan . and chop up some onion and put in oregano and salt , 
uh , i guess i've always kind of liked golf . 
at one time 
and that's how i picked up golf . 
and , uh , i don't know 
it's just kind of a challenging game . 
it sure is . 
i play at least three times a week . 
i'm on it , 
i haven't gotten the chance lately though to play . 
i'm trying to get back into it . 
uh , so , uh , i got to start all over again . 
it's not like riding a bicycle . 
you do tend to ,
well , i'm one of those rare lefthanded golfers . 
and i do enjoy playing . 
 what is your handicap ? 
right now it's three . 
uh , i was down at about four or five quite awhile ago . 
it's probably up there to twenty now if i   start again . 
well , if you play with some consistency though , you can get it right back down . 
i have got to try and get out there . 
i enjoy watching it . 
i don't know if it's just because i like the game or i just like to see the warm weather . 
uh , well , we can usually play here year around . 
sometimes in january it's not too comfortable to play . 
but there is usually two or three days in the week that you can get out there and play , 
and i'm pretty much addicted to golf , 
so . i get out there one way or the other . 
that's the problem out here with the long layovers with the winter 
you almost have to relearn every spring to get back out . 
it's a good game though . 
it's very challenging 
and the reason i like it so much is because i'm essentially playing against myself . 
that's the way i look at it . 
a lot of groups 
between themselves 
but i really don't care . 
um , i go out 
and each shot i say , well , this is what i'm going to try to do 
 and then i see how close i can come to that . 
you always work on trying to improve each day 
and inevitably one facet of my game isn't working at one time or another . 
either i'm not driving very well 
or i'm not hitting long irons very well 
or i'm not putting well 
but sometimes it all comes together . 
i know what you mean . 
i wouldn't , uh , chip well . 
one of the two , uh , 
or something would go wrong 
but i always managed to get near par anyway . 
well , we just had the tour championship here in pine hurst . 
and i went to that . 
craig  statler  won in a playoff . 
but we , uh , 
this is a big golf area . 
we have a lot of , uh , 
i'd say we probably have within fifteen miles , twenty golf communities built around courses that are pretty well designed and then of course , pine hurst 
and we still have the  greensboro  open here every year . 
do you have , uh , long waits , uh , to get on the course ? 
uh , it's only been that way in the last five years . 
but now you , uh , 
most of the courses have a , uh , two day advance tee time you have to call , 
i just moved into this small community 
so i'm going to try and get into one of the golf courses here . 
i'm hoping that won't be ,
are you sure you guys aren't having the bad weather ? 
we have cold . 
usually january and the first two weeks of february . 
well , i wish that's all we had . 
but , uh , last week we were in the seventies . 
something is coming through now 
so it's like in the low forties right now . 
but , uh , it's supposed to leave early in the week and then be back in the sixties . 
we have very windy winters 
but we don't get any snow anymore . 
i don't know what changed that pattern . 
we used to get four or five inches a year . 
now we get nothing . 
it's been probably five years since we've had any measurable snowfall . 
i see . 
well , at least that doesn't , uh , get in the way of golfing 
so that  , 
that's what they do here sometimes . 
you hear about it where they will take the orange ball out there 
but , if you got , 
so what do you , uh , think is uh , the worst culprit for air pollution ? 
well , i think it's probably a combination of things . 
um , factories an energy source with sulfur and nitrogen contaminants , you know , 
and you get sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides . 
uh , those are the ones i think primarily contribute to acid rain , 
and i think that's probably hurting us a little bit . 
where they have high industry . 
so we're not the lone ranger here . 
uh , i , 
it's hard to put the finger on , uh , what's worse , know , the acid rain situation or the ozone depletion , um , with , uh , your hydrocarbons , uh 
hopefully we're backing off from that a little bit , 
but i know we haven't cured it yet by a long shot . 
well , i notice on one of these , uh , home shopping networks they were selling these , uh , halogen , uh , fire extinguishers 
 and the halogen is , uh , an ozone depleter , 
and it got hydrocarbons in there . 
it's a very clean , uh , fire extinguisher , 
but it's , you know , really bad on the environment . 
i guess i missed that one . 
automobiles of course are contributing , too , 
and , you know , how we are with our love affair with the auto 
kind of hard to do anything about that , i guess . 
i know , 
uh , in the twin cities area , 
i just moved out of there and was kind of happy i timed it just right , 
but they had a new policy where in order to get uh , your car license , uh , renewed , you had to meet the pollution standards 
 and , uh . 
we have that here , too , 
but it's part of the inspection sticker , you know , 
they put a probe in your exhaust pipe 
and the computer reads whatever the ionization is coming out , 
yeah , uh , 
i guess that was just mainly in the cities there , 
and as far as where i live , i don't have to do that , 
and , uh , you know , there's no way i would put in a lot of money to repair it 
it'd probably be difficult anyway . 
so , although i do what i can to cut down pollution , 
but , uh . 
i was just reading an article in , uh , mother earth news magazine 
 and , uh , they've got a new , uh , 
you know a lot of places are burning wood 
a lot of people are burning wood , 
those of us who have , 
i've got a place in the country , you know 
 and , uh , they've had you know , catalytic converters on those , on , 
uh , i think they're required in california and oregon and washington , 
but they've had up those for quite a while , 
and somebody's come up with a new one that , uh , sort of , 
it's a catalytic converter , 
you know , into the smoke pipe 
 and , uh , apparently it sort of feeds itself . 
the more smoke is produced , you know , 
after you get to like five hundred degrees , the higher it gets the more complete the combustion is . 
and it sounds real neat . 
i haven't seen them priced anywhere yet , 
but that sounds like that might help solve that problem even on 
that might help a little bit , especially in some places . 
we're really lucky here . 
we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out . 
now sometimes we get a kind of a , 
especially in , uh , autumn it seem like we get kind of a brown haze sitting on us , 
but most of the time it's blowing out pretty well . 
probably blowing up there to you guys .
well , well around here we get , uh , 
well it depends , you know , 
either it blows it your way , 
and in the 
it comes back . 
i really think , uh , you know , we're doing some important things . 
education , raising consciousness awareness , 
uh , i know school kids , 
i work for the school district here , 
and , uh , you know , this is one of the big things with kids . 
kids are writing letters to the newspapers you know , telling adults to 
and , it's uh , you know , 
i hope we're not too late with it . 
uh , we're having all kinds of recycling . 
well , it , uh , that's a big thing , too . 
i know it has nothing to do with air pollution , 
but i kind of look at the way people treat our , 
 oh , well , i'm at , 
and i just happened to walk back into my office . 
i've been gone for a little while .
well , i go to school 
so i'm home certain days , 
have you received many ? 
i haven't here lately . 
it's , uh , 
what do you think ? .
well , i never gave it any thought myself .
i was hoping you could tell me what you thought . 
well , i don't have any objection to people doing that . 
i think it might be good for them . 
 but as a mother of two daughters i might be afraid of where they were sent . 
i'm just concerned about their safety 
 because if they do good work in america they'll probably be sent to a ghetto .
 and if they were sent to a third world country i couldn't help but wait worried , you know . 
that , that would be my main objection . 
i don't know 
i think maybe it should stay on a voluntary basis .
it will probably never happen 
i think it would be good for , uh , everyone to do something like that 
but i guess i don't feel like it should be something forced upon you . 
well it probably won't . 
 i don't even know how we'd pay for it anyway . 
we can't , uh 
that's another consideration .
but , uh , i don't know 
some kids are so spoiled nowadays 
it might be a real eye opener , you know .
i mean , sometimes my kids are on the other side of town here 
and they just see some really tiny modest wood frame homes 
and then they think , 
they're just kind of shocked at that side of town , you know .
i probably lived in one of those when i was a little girl .
wouldn't it though ? 
i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country . 
it is . 
i know . 
sometimes i wish we'd help them out instead of going all across the world ,
i know it . 
it seems to me we are , 
it would be to our benefit to strengthen that country .
but , what do i know , right ? .
i'm just sitting at home and , 
nobody has called me from washington .
i work at t i . 
oh , you do work at t i ? 
oh , you're in lewisville . 
 oh , yeah . 
i just went by that place . 
we were going to a football playoff game a week or so ago which we lost 
and , uh  ,
that's the first time i'd seen it . 
it looked really nice . 
a lot of trees there . 
it looked like a sight . 
hang on a minute . 
i don't think so , 
patty might . 
i'm back . 
oh , sure . 
well , my husband works at t i over on central . 
uh , why we're living in arlington i'm not so sure 
and tha , 
i don't know , 
so , um , 
i don't know , uh , 
i wonder if they really , 
there's so many with this one town 
even in some families some people talk a little bit different . 
oh , yeah . 
my husband is from new jersey 
and one of his sisters does things that really sound funny to me 
and he doesn't pronounce them at all that way , 
and that's one family , right ? .
of course , i think everybody in new jersey sounds a little bit funny 
but  , 
 oh , i agree . 
well , i'm surprised she hasn't told us to cut it off yet . 
sometimes she says  at night . 
so please end your conversation . 
well , do you have any more words of wisdom about the subject ? .
you don't have any kids you want to send over here ? .
well ,   is .
 well , uh , i don't know if mine would want to go live in the ghetto . 
well , one of them is real idealistic , 
she might .
my sister is , 
i'd be more  suited to  that than her 
she's just bugs , 
you ready ? 
and , uh , what , 
 well , i did subscribe to people for a long time . 
i do , you know , 
i enjoy people . 
and now uh , i , uh , subscribe to , uh , ladies home journal . 
i , uh , take a computer magazine .
are you interested in computers ? 
and my pet peeve with magazines 
well , that would be one of my peeves . 
my pet peeves with magazines , the woman's magazines especially , 
i mean , it's really geared to , 
all they have , 
you have too many recipes first of all . 
i just don't , you know , 
that's what i don't like about ladies home journal magazines . 
too many recipes , too many , uh , can this marriage with saved nonsense . 
you know , i like to read articles about things that matter . 
well , of course , people magazine is not , you know , one of uh , 
but it's nice , light reading .
you know , if i want something intellectual , i usually read a book . 
well , that's true . 
uh , i like it when they have short stories . 
like redbook used to always have a good short story in it . 
well , that's true , 
they did . 
and i haven't bought a redbook in a while  , 
so i guess  , 
i really very rarely ever pick up a magazine anymore .
well , is redbook still in existence ? 
i don't know if they're around anymore . 
it's an institution , 
surely it would have to be . 
well , i'll tell you , the only reason uh , i subscribe to the journal is because of , 
which i think it was either , 
it was publisher's clearinghouse  , 
they told me , you know , if i didn't subscribe they were going to take me off you know , their list .
mine , too .
this was it , my last chance .
right , my last chance to win ten million dollars , 
so i figured , hey , look .
well , i , 
that's it . 
oh , yeah , 
oh , uhhuh . 
and i was real disappointed with it . 
i don't know , 
it just , 
not enough stories with some substance that you can really get into . 
it's little short articles more than anything else . 
and that's one thing i don't like about people . 
uh , it you know , doesn't seem to have enough story to it . 
well , i don't know , 
i just think , uh , you know , it's , 
if you've only got a short time to read .
you know , well , you don't have to concentrate , you know you know . 
that's true .
it's entertaining , you know , 
and , uh , that's , 
i enjoy it , 
you know , i , uh .
well , that entertainment is very , 
to the tv guide ? 
uh ,  , no , 
i mean , not the one i take now . 
it's a magazine 
and it goes into all the movies , previewing the movies 
oh , uhhuh . 
oh , i see . 
and , uh , i'm a real movie buff , 
so that's why i thought i might be interested in it , 
but it just hasn't been what i thought it would be . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , uh , my mother is the reason i get , uh , the home journal and the , uh , computer book is because mother got a subscription for it and sent it to me . 
otherwise , if i really want to take the time to read a magazine and i see one on the grocery shelf , i'll pick it up then .
well , i'll tell you , since i've been getting the journal , like maybe i'll read two , maybe three , 
if i read three articles in , you know , one of the journals , i figure , you know , i did really well . 
because there's just nothing in there that interests me . 
i'm not into , you know , recipes 
and  , 
well , i do like recipes and crafts . 
see , now , and i'm not into crafts , 
so , you know , that eliminates , like three quarters of the magazine .
that's true . 
well , i just got the new issue , 
they have bette midler on the cover , 
so that should be one article that i'll read anyway .
do you , uh , 
so , how is the weather out there ? 
uh , it's really cold 
and supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold 
and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had . 
oh , really ? 
you have , breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff . 
how about you guys ? 
um . uh , it's about same . 
the usual , i think . 
so , nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff .
it's good . 
well let's see , well , the snow here is different from utah's , 
because i have lived in utah for like ten years . 
oh , really ? 
what part ? 
and , uh , 
i was going to b y u . 
oh , really ? 
and , uh , the snow is like , really cold . 
i mean , it's , like , really humid 
so it seems wetter or something like that . 
it's more humid in utah than there ? 
or there ? 
it's more humid in iowa 
and it seems like when the winds blow , it goes right through you . 
it's really different from utah's weather . 
i thought utah was cold , 
but i think iowa is a lot colder .
see , that's how it is in texas , too 
because when it's cold , it's really cold . 
i don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind .
what's that ? 
so the humidity is i think what does it .
i think that's true . 
because i noticed when i got here , too , 
because like i'd , 
when it would snow in texas 
and we'd have to get really warm , 
and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing 
and you don't 
that's true . 
it was weird . 
so how long ago did you graduate ? 
or did you , 
uh , i graduated in nineteen eightyseven . 
oh , really ? 
my husband got his doctorate at b y u , 
so that's , 
and so he just graduated this past year . 
so you just barely moved away ? 
do you like it out there ? 
we miss 
you do ? 
because it's , like , really flat here .
well , not flat , but hilly . 
but no big mountains or anything . 
so you just moved away a year ago ? 
wow , really recent . 
but , uh , see what else can i say about the weather . 
it was like fortyfive .
oh , warm .
so , what's the temperature up today over there ? 
like , it's probably fifty , fiftyfive , maybe . 
oh , really ? 
maybe not that warm . 
probably about , uh , 
it's not that cold , really . 
and whenever i remembered the weather reports in utah , i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill . 
but they talk about wind chill here all the time . 
that's a big deal in texas , too . 
they said it could be , like , six degrees out and , like , negative fortyone wind chill . 
so , that's what we're not used to .
that's true . 
that makes a big difference . huh . 
so , oh , i , 
so , did you used to ski when you were out here ? 
what's that ? 
did you used to ski when you were in utah ? 
oh , i've only skied in utah once . 
oh , really ? 
i only skied once my whole life .
but , do you do a lot of skiing there ? 
i've only been once so far , but had the opportunity a couple times since then . 
just saving my money for christmas things 
so is this your first year in utah ? 
uh , no , 
and you're going to school there ? 
at u of u , 
oh , really ? 
so , but , i'll be here a long time  , at this rate . 
what's your major ? 
uh , it was nursing , 
but i'm in the process of changing it right now . 
because it's really , really competitive at b y u . 
you have to have like a three seven to get in 
that's true . 
i'm going to look into some other fields . 
i'd like , 
all the science classes and that , i'm just not really enjoying too much 
that's a good idea . 
did you graduate in a certain field 
uh , education . 
i got a double major . 
uh , elementary and special ed . 
that what my sister did . 
oh , really ? 
here name is lori , bird . 
maybe not .
i think she graduated around then , too , though , eightyseven probably , 
but , she got her doc , 
there are so many girls in all my classes , 
i can't remember 
because they , since , uh , stopped that program . i mean , where you can 
oh , have they ? 
i mean , it's really , 
we're set . 
what changes do you feel have happened ? 
oh , i guess the first thing has been uh , for the right , for women to vote . 
i think that has been a major change and also the fact that , uh , there are so many more women in the work force nowadays than there were 
and that's probably going to increase .
i'm sorry ? 
it increases each year i think . 
it sure does . 
there is a lot more women in the work place nowadays . 
well , and i think women have kind of had , uh , in the past the real subservient 
and , uh , 
that's changing .
well , we do to some degree 
 but , uh , uh , i think it's not as much as it was . 
i agree . 
it definitely 
because there is just , impossible to keep up on everything else . 
have more of an active role in taking care of children , more of an active role in taking care of the home . 
well , you know , they've been talking about 
and i don't know , uh , what the status is on it , 
but , you know , women get maternity leave and stuff like that 
and i know that there has been discussion about men also getting maternity leave 
but you know , i haven't really heard much about that recently . 
well , you know , there is a lot of companies that won't give women maternity leave for that very reason . 
uh , in fact , i know the school districts down here , they don't have maternity leave . 
oh , is that right ? 
and i don't know , uh , if bigger company companies do , 
but when i was employed with the school district , i didn't have maternity leave either 
and that was the reason 
because they thought was showing  prejisim  to women and not to men 
huh , that's interesting . 
that's a bummer , though .
 , it is . 
i mean , 
you have to save all of your , uh , vacation time . 
you do . 
you have to save all your vacation time 
but , uh , 
what do you see , uh , changing in the future ? 
i think that we're probably going to see a lot more companies , uh , run by females . 
 and we'll prob , 
i'm sorry ? 
maybe top level . 
upper management , 
more women in upper management 
and probably , uh , we'll see more females in political roles . 
more governors and , i think , you know , roles like that . 
that would be kind of nice .
well , in texas , we have a female governor . 
that's right , 
and we had a female mayor here in dallas , 
and her term just ended 
 uh , so i think we're probably going to see more of that 
i think that's probably good . 
a little more integration . 
and , uh , maybe not so much that we sit on the back burners 
right , you know , 
i mean , and that's fine with me 
i think , 
 but sometimes , 
i mean i'm not a women's libber by any means , 
there are issues that , you know , as far as , like , equal pay for men and women and that kind of stuff , i totally am for . 
but , i don't get into uh , the real 
i don't either . 
i don't think they're ever going to prove that men and women are equal .
we just function differently .
and , uh , i'm not capable of lifting what , uh , a man can lift and 
but , uh 
and they're probably , 
i'm sure , in dallas since you're big places , a lot more women are , uh , working right out of their home with their p c's or with their lap computers or whatever . 
i've heard of that . 
uh , i haven't really talked to anybody that's , you know , too involved with that . 
but , i mean , i think that is a , 
i think that , 
like the cottage industry . 
is that what you're talking about , women working out of their homes ? 
uh , i think it's wonderful .
you only have to check in with the office once or twice a week 
course , they're talking about , uh , that we're going to be able to do our grocery shopping and 
oh , i kn , 
by the phone and all that . 
so , uh , it would be kind of exciting in some ways to see a little bit more of that 
and some ways , it might be kind of scary . 
think anybody could do it , 
i wouldn't mind just calling up the grocery store and giving them my order and 
but then you know , there is the process of selection . 
would you have to give them 
and , would be nice , though . 
  how big is provo ? 
that a little town or a bigger city ? 
um , it's not one of the bigger ones . it's probably , um , i compare it to the size of plano , maybe a little smaller . 
plano , texas . 
i talked to someone that was only a couple of thousand in her town , i think . 
i forgot the name of the town . 
i thought maybe it was you .
i certainly have some ideas since i'm studying it now in college . 
i'd say , first of all , they need to go back to spending more time on the basic reading , writing , arithmetic 
because they really teach you about forty percent less than they used to , 
and it shows up . 
that's one idea . 
do you have any ? 
um , i don't know , 
i think i'm pretty satisfied with , um , 
i grew up in plano 
 and my dad is actually on the school board there , 
so , i kind of kept up with a lot of things that went on . 
plano , uh , improved greatly in the last twenty , twentyfive years 
that's for sure . 
it used to be the pits . 
and arlington is excellent now , 
but i'm just speaking overall 
something is definitely wrong . 
and , uh , one thing , they don't spend as much time just teaching reading and writing , 
so a lot of kids are just being promoted from year to year 
and they truly can't read 
 so i don't know how they expect them to , uh , pass history when they can't read anything , you know , even read a word problem in math . 
so , um , that's definitely a problem . 
another problem is you're going to keep the smarter people in the system too long paying the wages they do . 
but , um , 
so what do you think is good about the schools ? 
that is good about , 
well , it depends on where you are . 
they're all so different . 
that's another thing 
there's no national curriculum , you know , 
i mean , what they'd be teaching in an arlington school they may not be teaching in a plano school 
 and in the same school district , even in an arlington seventh grade for instance , you may have an english class 
you may have half literature for the whole year , 
whereas in another one they're going to concentrate on grammar 
grammar . 
it's up to the teacher , in other words . 
so you know , that's kind of odd to me . 
it depends on , uh , what school you're in and who your teacher is , actually 
 or is how you end up .
overall , arlington is good , one of the better ones in the state , 
so i guess we lucked out when we moved here . 
so , yeah , 
that's the thing is just to look at the school system in the area that you move into before you . 
of course we have a slight problem in that , uh , the number of the illiterate in america is mushrooming at this point , 
and , uh , you know , where our kids might be in a great school , we're still paying an awful lot of taxes for people who are on welfare and unemployment because they can't read , you know . 
but do you think that there should be , um , nationwide , um , curriculum ? 
i don't know . 
i just read about that the other day , 
and i had never even thought of it . 
actually it makes sense to a certain extent , 
because sometimes , like a third grade teacher will get kids from second grade that didn't even learn what , uh , 
they should to do the work that she is supposed to teach , you know . 
so i guess if there was a national curriculum we'd at least have a certain amount that all kids would learn . 
but , uh . we actually rank fortyninth in the world as far as just plain literacy goes , you know . 
that's pretty low that there's 
so , um , unless we want to keep paying for these people that can't make it in society , we're going to have to do something . 
i don't know . 
obviously nobody's smart enough to have figured it out yet , 
so i probably can't .
but i do think that we have to cut out some of this folderol stuff and go back in the first five , six grades and just keep going over and over and over until most of those that are capable can at least learn to read and write 
 because they can't even get the menial job without being able to read something nowadays 
uh , you can't even work an answering machine if you're at work and had to get a message or something  , you know , or fill out an application to work at mcdonalds if you can't read . 
so , uh , i think that's a start at least , going back to the basics in the early grades 
 and , um , they say that the average english student nowadays does at least fifty percent less reading and writing than they did twenty years ago , 
and that's a big jump . 
i believe that .
did you go to school in plano ? 
through high school . 
uh , kinder , 
we have a terrible air pollution problem . 
do you really ? 
our summers are extremely , uh , hazardous 
 and during , uh , certain wind directions because we get the , uh , gary , indiana 
 and we can look out on the lake and just see the brown haze , uh 
that's horrible . 
and they do post , uh , uh , warnings for people who have , uh , heart diseases or respiratory problems 
in the winter it's not as severe . 
but , uh , if the wind comes basically from the south it can be really bad . 
uh , the state of wisconsin , as a matter of fact , uh , started some litigation against illinois because of the air pollution we were getting . 
uh , i don't think it's going to go very far , 
but it was , uh , a way of , uh , triggering , uh , awareness . 
so what's the conditions like in dallas ? 
well , uh , in dallas , quite on a level that we had in denver . 
i grew up in denver , 
and i've lived there most of my life , 
and we used to have uh , you know , the posted warning days . 
uh , however , in colorado now , they have the emissions control law , which has really cut down , 
probably only once every couple of years do we ever have pollution so bad that they have to post warnings now , you know , as far as health concerns . 
uh , due to all of our , uh , smog was caused by vehicles rather than industry . 
wisconsin has a law in which we need to take our cars in every year when we apply for a new license tag 
and if they don't qualify then they have to take it to a mechanic and have it gone over and then verify that it is drivable . 
so , they've tried to do a lot of that 
 and i thi , 
you know , there seem to be , at least in certain little pockets , 
and we were talking earlier about madison 
madison has one of the nicest , uh , bike , uh , road , uh , sharing programs of any city in wisconsin 
oh , really . 
 and all wisconsin has probably the most extensive number of , uh , bike trails for recreational use 
and there is of biking 
 but , um , there are still a lot of people who insist on driving their own automobiles 
i find that a little irritating , because 
it becomes , uh , 
maybe to you and i who have grown up uh , how horrible it really is . 
send them to wisconsin , 
oh really .
how'd you like to own a piece of property where your lake is going sour 
it's , uh , really a serious issue for those of us up in this , uh , sector up here . 
or air pollution comes from vehicles 
i think it's mostly vehicles 
that causes the acid rain . 
that i'm a little uncertain of , 
i had talked with my parents . 
and grew up a little bit in terre haute , 
and i had asked them before , uh , 
i went back to visit recently , about a year ago , 
and i asked them , 
i'm sorry , um 
that's okay , 
let me see , 
what are your hobbies ? 
you heard her in the background .
that's babies . 
i like , uh , most sports . 
i like to do that . 
i kind of like to do a little bit of sewing . 
oh , little bit of embroidery work , once in a while . 
what do you like to do ? 
um , i try to do some painting , although i'm not very good at it .
well , i'm sure you probably are . 
well , no , 
not really . 
you like it , 
that's the main   .
you know , i inherited the genes that make me think i'm creative ,
that's right . 
so , i always try . 
i do some sewing , mostly out of necessity . 
um , i'm making drapes for my house , just because i'm , 
oh , boy , that's hard sewing . 
it is , you know , 
actually the sewing isn't the hard part , 
it's just being able to lay out the material and measure it 
measure it and get it to , 
if you get pleats and all kinds of , 
i've been doing that 
that's a lot of work . 
but usually have to do the pleats by hand . 
so that , at least 
and i've gone and , you know , put the needle through my thumb a few times  ,
that feels really good . 
so that's not really my favorite thing to do or anything , but i need to do it . 
let's see , i have a dog , and a lot of fish . 
keeping fish , i guess 
keeping fish   .
well , they're probably easier than keeping dogs , though , aren't they . 
it depends on how frequently they die , and 
oh , no . 
how much that bothers you , 
and you probably have to clean out the tank too . 
in fact , my problem , 
i had fish as a kid 
and they always died 
oh , no . 
and , what i think now is the reason is i kept the tank too clean 
oh , you're kidding 
 because you have , 
 because they need to have a little bit of the , 
you need to let the bacteria build up , 
and then it keeps all the chemicals in balance . 
i see . 
and i would just take everything out and just like , you know , wash it with scalding hot water 
oh , no . 
 and it would kill all the bacteria , 
and that would screw up all the chemical cycles again 
and so you'd have to 
that's right . 
so now i only clean things to make things look more aesthetically pleasing 
 and i don't try and sterilize things .
don't go through the whole nine yards 
that's right . 
that's right . 
so you've had fish for a long time . 
well , i've had them , 
i guess it's been two years now i've had a tank here , 
and then back at home i used to have a small , you know , five gallon tank . 
but that never worked well . 
what size do you have now ? 
oh , that's a good size . 
it's a lot easier . 
have you ever had it , uh , crack or break or leak . 
fiftyfive gallons , you'd hope it would never do that . 
that's right , 
i really do . 
but , you know . 
do you have all kinds of different fish 
i don't get into the 
real exotic . 
the expensive ones . 
well , they're probably harder to take care of 
they are . 
they're very expensive 
and , you know , when they die it's more like an investment . 
i bet it is . 
you lost an investment 
do you have problems with uh , the fish eating each other ? 
only if there's baby fish . 
you always have to isolate those . 
then you have to , 
how do you isolate them ? 
you get a 
a jar or something 
 well , no , 
it's a little plastic things that sort of floats 
 and you put the mother fish in there 
and then it's got like a trough underneath her 
 so as the babies come out they fall down in the trough 
and there's a hole in the middle so they fall into the bottom part of the chamber 
and that's , you know , 
it kind of works , 
but it's also got slots in it so the water can circulate 
it'll fit out the slots . 
that's right , 
but , you know , it works , i guess . 
that works all right then . 
they don't , uh , want the mothers to be with the little fish either . 
oh , they'll eat them . 
they will . 
isn't that odd . 
you wouldn't think that . 
and it's funny because the one i have , every single month without fail she has babies . 
you're kidding . 
oh , no . 
all the time , 
and , um , i , 
and she's supposed to , 
her variety , it says they won't eat the babies , 
and i've seen her do it . 
oh , it's ter , 
well , it makes you understand that , you know , things are different .
things are different in the animal kingdom , huh . 
 right . we might decide what's proper and what isn't , 
that's kind of the way they do it . 
that's it . 
survival of the fittest or something . 
because if the baby is strong enough , it can swim away fast enough 
go hide from them , 
but . if you're like me , you never have enough time for the hobbies . 
i try . 
i play a couple of instruments . 
uh , well , uh , the cowboys are my favorite team . 
that's pretty easy to say nowadays .
lot easier than it was a couple years ago , 
but they had a big win today . 
uh , did you get to watch it ? 
i , uh , have been at my computer all day 
are you a cowboy fan ? 
well , i used to be a real big cowboy fan 
and , uh , i'm not a jimmy johnson fan . 
it's kind of hard not to be a cowboy fan , though . 
they've always been , you know , my favorite . 
i just hate that that's the coach 
so , now have they , 
like just , you know , two years ago they were one and fifteen . 
they won like just one game 
and so pretty fast turnaround . 
but this year they made it to playoffs 
and today was the first game 
and they beat the chicago bears 
so everybody's really going crazy , you know , down here . 
i'll bet they are . 
they're going crazy , 
so they turned it around , 
but , you know , they have a lot of young exciting players now , uh , 
i mean , everybody was real upset , you know , when they fired tom landry , 
but , you know , now it's like , you know , they're doing good so everybody's forgotten about that . 
uh , football fans are probably the most fickle people in the world . 
hit a bad season 
and it's , you know , the coach's fault , 
let's dump him . 
first good season , the coach can do no wrong . 
uh , you know , they have a young team . 
it's , you know , a lot different than the teams they used to have where it's the same old , you know , players every year and , you know , same coach , same everything , 
so , now it's , you know , like a taste of something different . 
they're all not , you know , mister nice guys like they used to be . 
now it's like , you know , tough and dirty team 
so everybody is really excited . 
who is the competition going to be ? 
well , it's supposed to be the redskins , but you know , we beat them already . 
we beat them this year in washington 
you know , so everybody has the feeling like we can go all the way to the super bowl , 
but , you know , it's just that we have to play every game away , you know , 
it's going to be tough , 
but every , 
the competition are teams that they've already beat this year , 
so , i mean , atlanta , they're in it , too , 
and we beat them 
and , uh , see , detroit , we play them next week , 
but , you know , we should beat them . 
everybody feels like we should be able to beat them 
 so everything's , uh , looking real good . 
course , i think , you know , you can't really go by what happened earlier in the season 
and , you know 
well the cowboys are on a roll . 
they've won , like , i think six or seven in a row now , 
so they're supposed to be the hottest team in the league going into the playoffs 
but since you have an o u drop out as a quarterback , 
troy aikman , 
he got hurt at o u , 
so he transferred 
o u has always been known for their running game . 
more than , 
they're playing tonight in fact . 
i'm watching them on t v right now . 
but they're doing some stomping on virginia . 
oh , i tell you , 
they've not had much of a team this year , bless their little hearts .
well , they're doing good tonight . 
are they ? 
i haven't 
they're winning . 
well , good 
but , yeah , 
and , uh , that's right , 
aikman did go to o u . 
i forgot about that . 
they h , 
then he went out to southern cal . 
is that where he went ? 
but , the cowboys did good today . 
i mean , i was proud . 
i thought they would get beat today because , i mean they're so young , you know , 
you've got it . 
do you have pets ? 
uh , my wife and i have a dog that soon be eight years old , 
and we have a cat , which is , uh , i guess about five years old . 
oh , my goodness . 
how about you guys ? 
we have three dogs and 
three dogs . 
and two bi , 
what kind of birds do you have ? 
no , kidding . 
enjoy them ? 
oh , have a ball with them . 
you let them out and let them fly around and everything ? 
well , no , 
so in order to have the birds not stuffed i have to keep them in their 
you know , this is like a cruelty joke , 
and i apologize if you're a bird lover , 
but , uh , we had a parakeet .
knocked that parakeet right out of the air . 
well , we had that happen once , um , 
my son had the bird back in his room , 
because well , the first one that we had was his bird , 
and i had a ceiling fan put up , 
and the bird got away from him one afternoon , 
and i mean that sucker hit that fan and went flying up against the wall , 
it killed him ? 
 oh , that's , 
well , it killed ours , 
i'll be darned . 
but it threw him up against the wall , you know , 
and he slid down the wall . 
well , speaking of pets , i'll tell you , my kids are older now , 
both of them are either in or out of college , 
my son had a burmese boa constrictor , 
and finally my wife , bless her heart , got rid of it , because i didn't really like it . 
we also had a , 
one year down in florida on a vacation , for father's day , my kids , years ago , maybe , uh , ten years ago , bought me a skunk from a exotic pet shop . 
like , it'd been like deactivated as far as 
oh , my goodness . 
and we had that darn pet skunk for about five years , 
and my son left , went to school , 
we finally sold his boa constrictor , 
but my son needed some money , 
and we sold it for about two hundred and fifty dollars . 
you're kidding . 
so , when the guy came over , he was infatuated by that skunk , 
so i made him a deal , 
so he took the skunk , too . 
and the skunk was a decent pet , 
but , you know , does his little jobbies in the litter box , 
and is . 
oh well , that's pretty good . 
and it was sort of a neat , 
but , they just stink too much .
oh , yeah , 
that was sort of fun , you know , 
i tell everyone this story because my wife is a real pet lover . 
i use to visualize my wife ,   
many times my wife would be lying there on the sofa , 
and this snake honestly would be stretched across the top of her body 
 oh , you're kidding . 
 and the skunk would be sitting at her feet , 
but the cat would be on the back of the sofa , 
and a dog would be running around crazy .
oh , my gosh . 
i can not ima , 
i don't , 
in fact my brother has uh , a exotic pet shop out in california , 
and he keeps threatening to send a snake through the mail , you know , 
 oh , gosh . 
oh , my son bought this snake , uh ,   
someone gave it to him when he was in junior high school , 
and it was just a small thing then , 
but it got to be pretty big , 
and , you know , feed him small mice to big rats and things like that 
it's just , uh , too much . 
that snake used to watch our cat walk around . 
i always told my wife , 
 oh , my gosh . 
 oh , my gosh . 
that is wild . 
oh , i just can't do those , and the lizards and 
oh , me neither . 
they need to stay outside , far away from me . 
we're down to a simple dog and cat now , 
and that's the way it should be , 
haven't had any parakeets for quite a while , 
uh , customer of mine has a parrot , 
and , uh , gosh , sticks in my mind he paid eighteen hundred dollars for a parrot , 
and that was just mind boggling . 
 oh , yeah , 
they are so expensive . 
well , my son was just dying for a bird , 
and i'm really allergic to them , 
are you ? 
and , uh , we went down to canton one time 
and he'd saved up his allowance , you know , and picked him out a bird in a bird cage 
clamped onto my finger and would not , 
i mean , i had to literally shake him off to get him in the cage , 
and he has tried to bite me for two years , 
and all of a sudden this bird and i have become wonderful friends . 
oh , gosh . 
he gives me kisses , 
he talks now 
that's neat . 
 and it's just hysterical . 
i'm the only one that pays attention to him . 
why , sure . 
and i'm a substitute teacher 
we have too many pets . 
come to my menagerie . 
they knew the sucker when they saw one . 
so now we have two parakeets . 
so you enjoy camping ? 
oh , yeah . 
is it ? 
you know , i , uh , camped in the boy scouts 
and , you know , my dad and i went out sometimes 
and it is cheaper to pitch a tent and cook your meals out by the fire than it is to rent an apartment 
i mean , when you have to have it , you have got to have it . 
and , you know , in those those kinds of situations , uh , room rent which is outrageous . 
 so , my buddy and i , we just camped .
and we figured , what the hell , 
we did it when we were kids 
and we loved it . 
of course , we didn't really rough it that much . 
when i was in high school , 
he is a couple years older than me 
and , uh , he graduated and went off to college 
and , uh , during the summer we would camp out at the lake . 
but it wasn't very much like camping because we had a refrigerator and a stove .
 oh , well . eah . 
you know , i had a little boat house and floated it out on lake grapevine . 
and , uh , well , it was fantastic . 
we would get up in the morning , go skiing , uh , 
that substituted for a shower 
 and then we would go to work and uh , come back to the , uh , you know , boat house at night 
and , uh , in the afternoon , you know , it is still four o'clock . 
you have got four hours of day light , good skiing left . 
and , uh , it was great . 
but , uh , you know , now all my life is more like camping than not camping really . 
do you have electricity out there . 
oh , yeah . 
you've got a phone obviously .
we didn't have a phone . 
they didn't have phone lines . 
you just couldn't get phones . 
and , uh , we are third from the end on the electric string . 
so , we are at the end of the mail route .
like i said , we are probably as far as you can get from the seven eleven and still be in texas . 
 but , uh , you know , right now , uh , what we did , my wife and i , is we got a mobile home .
i'm in construction 
and , uh , you know i just had this place you know to shower up while i was you know out here , you know , putting up fence and building a driveway and drilling a well and all that stuff you have to do before you can even put a house in you know . 
and , uh , i came home from work one friday afternoon 
and our truck was back . 
everything we had was in boxes 
so , we have been roughing it out here for about three years , 
but it is not bad . 
we have color t v , microwave you know 
it is not horrible , 
but it's a lot like camping . 
well i grew up in california , in southe , 
so it is a fortyfive minute drive to the mountains 
 uh , so my dad loved fishing and camping . 
so we would go up . 
first , we went up uh , with a toyota pick up truck and laid out our sleeping bags under the stars and you know cooked our , uh , hot dogs by the fire or whatever . 
but then later my mom and dad got a camper 
so , uh 
became civilized . 
a little bit in the world . 
my mom goes camping you know . 
she takes her , uh , motor home . 
you know , she's got one of these huge winnebago's with a refrigerator and airconditioning , color t v , microwave oven 
she just , 
roughing it for me is going to the holiday inn and getting a shower .
but , you know , she has a lot of fun . 
and mostly , it is just a way to , 
she goes to dog shows . 
see , she shows dogs 
and , uh , you can sneak a dog into a motel 
 but you can't sneak ten dogs into a motel . 
so , she , uh , you know , takes the motor home .
and she made a deal with my dad that she would take all the dogs with her when she went dog showing . 
and she , 
if he would buy her a motor home .
so he did .
but as far as camping , my wife and i have plans to , uh , not really camp per se , but to drive up the , uh , you know , highway one there in california 
 oh uh , 
i am going to need a vacation .
that's really pretty out there . 
there are a lot of nice places , 
well , what kind of vacations do you like to take ?   .
well , uh , we've been fortunate enough to take a couple of trips over to europe 
we've really enjoyed them . 
where have you gone there ? 
we've gone to , um , germany , switzerland , austria , ireland and england . 
we've been to germany twice . 
but , um , i guess my favorite is probably switzerland and ireland . 
well , i've been over there too . 
where have you been ? 
i even . 
let's see , um , 
mostly germany and france . 
i lived in france for a year and a half 
oh , how neat . 
but , once when i had a chance in france to go on vacation instead of travelling around france i went to germany 
 because , uh , i've got relatives there 
and i just 
oh , that's neat . 
but , um , austria , i found really pretty 
and i lived in the alps in france 
oh , how neat . 
oh , yeah . 
then i finally made it to england , too , uh , on my way home , um , 
i lived in africa , actually , 
and on my way home from there . 
you lived in africa ? 
oh , my goodness .
or unless you fly from nairobi , you have to fly through , um , uh , europe on your way home . 
so , i went to england , 
and i really liked it there too . 
it's so expensive over there .
i know , 
it's true . 
that's the one thing . 
it really is . 
i love to go over there , 
but it's so darn expensive 
actually now you can get some really good deals flying over , 
but it's 
once you're there you still have to spend money .
oh , i know , 
then you can stay with them , 
that helps a lot . 
you know there's a lot of places in the states that we haven't even gone . 
you know , i'd like to go to hawaii some time , 
we've at least gone to the grand canyon and niagara falls . 
feel like we've accomplished a little bit here . 
i haven't . 
most of my vacationing in the u s has been on the west coast 
 or this summer i went to colorado 
 and , uh , i'd love to go to the east coast , during the fall . 
 oh , the 
it's , oh , 
i've always wanted to go there . 
i've seen pictures , 
um , we made a trip up the east coast . 
it was , uh , in the summer 
 and it really is pretty . 
it's , uh , 
both coasts are really pretty 
 but , um , i love the carolinas . 
it's just gorgeous over there . 
i haven't been anywhere on the east coast . 
i think tennessee has been the furthest east i've been . 
well , you'll just have to plan a vacation some time 
but you know , there's a lot to see here 
 but i just love going over to europe because their way of life is just so different than ours . 
you know , we're so fast paced here , 
and over there , you know , every time we'd go and eat dinner or lunch or whatever we'd always have to ask for the check 
they're so leisurely over there 
 and it's kind of nice to have that . 
so the type of vacation you'd like , um , 
well , usually a bunch of different places . 
probably because you want to see everything . 
see as much as 
i know . 
how did you like africa ? 
well , i liked it . 
i was working in cameroon , africa 
 and it's not a place for tourists , 
i mean , they're not used to having tourists there , 
you're kind of roughing it . 
but , um , i liked it , 
i liked it . 
the people there are just very friendly 
what type of work ? 
um , i was working with an organization that does bible translation . 
oh , okay . 
so i was doing linguistic work actually , travelling around , finding out about languages , and 
oh , uhhuh . 
find out where the languages are . 
so , i travelled a lot around the country and met a lot of people . 
that's neat . 
i enjoyed it . 
 um , i've talked to people who have been to africa , 
and they , 
and then of course when that movie out of africa came out .
um , but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there . 
my cousin came over while i was there , 
and she came to cameroon 
and then she went over to nairobi and took a safari around 
 oh how neat . 
so , she'd always dreamed of doing that too . 
that's great . 
 so . yeah . 
so is there any place you would try to talk me into going to  ? 
it sounds like we've been to some of the same places . 
it does . 
well , uh , i don't know . 
i think the budget is really out of hand right now , 
and especially in this election year , i think that , uh , there ought to be at least some conversation about what 
it kind of seems to me that everyone's offering , you know , their token little tax cut program , you know , when it's 
and , uh , well , as you said , mostly they are token cuts . 
the ninetyseven cents a week .
now what , 
that's really not going to do a lot of good , it doesn't seem to me , to your average 
another ninetyseven cents , 
hell you can buy a coke or something for that . 
i mean , mostly a cut , 
it's just a cut in the amount withheld , you know . 
um , yeah 
i don't see this   changing my lifestyle a whole lot . 
that ninetyseven cents really isn't going to do it for me either . 
uh , other candidates have said that have made a lot of sense to me either , 
especially the democratic candidates don't seem to be coming up with much that really sparks my interest as far as yeah , maybe that could do something to affect our budget 
i believe it was dukakis 
it was dukakis , 
 but i can't . 
i have a lot of respect for him .
i will not 
but it seems to me uh , that the budget is so out of hand , 
and we're supposed to be getting a peace dividend you know 
well , i'd really like to know where that money is actually going to go , 
because , in my opinion , i don't think i'm ever going to see any of this socalled peace dividend . 
 oh , yeah . 
i mean , if they could actually put something together and make , 
i'm not really in favor of large government social programs , either , because i feel that they waste 
but with this peace dividend , it seems like you could set up some kind of like 
oh , yeah , 
i think that would be a great idea , you know , like the conservation corps , you know where . 
it would help unemployment greatly . 
and it . 
 and in that way we could really focus on building the infra structure of the country . 
infra structure is in , 
i mean , we have hurt ourselves incredibly   last fifty years in the 
and i surely don't hear anybody saying that right now . 
um , yeah , 
i agree totally .
um , i mean , you know , so ridiculous that it was allowed to happen . 
um , i'm in college right now , 
so am i . 
oh really , 
where do you go ? 
uh , i u . 
i go to georgia tech , um . 
and , in , 
i had you know , the required political science class 
and one of the things we discussed was , you know , how the budget situation just got so out of hand . 
and essentially what happened was , 
i think it was like in the , um , tax year of eightyone , um , 
 and you know , byebye removing the tax cut 
and you just ,   .
you just have to wonder what they're thinking in washington . 
i mean , it's just like they're playing chicken with a loaded gun . 
uh , well , it's more than a loaded , 
it's a loaded cannon . 
i mean 
and they , in my opinion , don't do a very responsible job 
well , yeah , 
i mean , it's kind of like rome and the bread and circuses thing , you know 
 and then i'm going to go on and just forget everything that i said 
 or you know , it doesn't seem that it's going to make much of a difference . 
i mean , i don't know , 
i don't think george bush will make the american people happy with ninetyseven cents a week . 
not at all . 
i just don't think it was a well thought out incentive . 
   , how do you feel about crime in the city ? 
you say you're from atlanta . 
actually i live in the city 
 and , uh , i guess it is a concern of mine , uh , you know , for my own safety . 
i mean , do you find crime in atlanta really   
i live in atlanta also . 
well that's right . 
however i think , the area that i live in of the city . 
i think it seems that there's certain areas where , uh , the crime is focused 
well what do you think can be done about the crime in the city ? 
well , i think put more guys , more cops , higher visibility , 
and , uh , 
and probably , um , they need to try to increase community involvement , that sort of thing , i think   .
you know , particularly in some of the housing projects , uh , you know , that tends to be where a lot of that crime is focused 
 and they've got to do more than just having cops there . 
they've got to kind of change the way people think about it . 
um , so , um , well do you think atlanta's as bad as most other cities ? 
um , well , i've been to , 
um , it's nowhere near as bad as new york city 
probably not as bad as detroit . 
i don't think it's as bad as l a either . 
i don't think we have as much of the gang problem as a lot of the other cities have . 
that seems to be true . 
um , yeah , 
if you've ever been to like new york city 
it's that obvious . 
i don't know , 
i came to the conclusion also that , you know , and trying not to look like a victim , you know . 
that's true . 
you know , 
with a big stick 
and , you know , don't be 
an alley 
or don't get 
just try to keep yourself out of a bad situation 
 but , yeah , 
there are times when you can't avoid all that 
 and then you're kind of on your own .
  have you ever been mugged in atlanta ? 
uh , no . 
 but that was in a more of a setting where there was a number of people around , 
and i kind of got , 
i was much younger at the time 
 and kind of a couple of people , they just took it from me without me knowing really 
i've had that happen , 
but that's about it . 
i've been pretty lucky about getting mugged . 
 oh , yeah . 
i think i've only actually seen like you know , one actual robbery with a gun 
 and that's been about the only , you know , you know , potentially violent crime that i've seen in atlanta . 
well , i've had my . 
and that was just a guy running out of a store that he just robbed . 
i've had my car stolen , 
so maybe that counts . 
oh , really . 
oh , where was that ? 
was that downtown 
oh no , 
it's actually cobb county , 
but it is atlanta 
 and , uh , there's a lot of car thefts in that area . 
known some people that have had their cars stolen . 
uh , the a p d seems to recover them , you know 
my friend had a v w rabbit , 
and when he got it back his , um , dashboard was sitting in the front seat .
it had been wrecked and some superficial type damage , 
but they didn't strip it 
 so i got it back . 
well , you're probably luckier than . 
um , so like does insurance pay for the body damage , 
it was about three grand to put everything together . 
they cracked the steering column of course , to steal the car . 
you crack the steering column 
and you pull the , 
there's a pin in there that you can pull on these g m cars 
 and you can start it up , basically pretty easily . 
so how do you know this much about , um , stealing cars ? 
 well , after i found mine i had this , 
so , how you like new jersey ? 
uh , it's pretty good , you know . 
you get , uh , closer to the , uh , coast here , 
and you do get a good bit of , uh , smog and stuff , especially from all the , uh , fuel cracking towers and chemical plants . 
 uh , i don't know what part of new jersey you're in , but i guess it's , uh , fairly industrial ? 
when you get further east towards new york city it gets very industrial 
right , uhhuh . 
 but i'm about , uh , thirty miles west of there 
so you have , uh , actually green trees and such that you 
actually very , 
miles out and you got , uh , farms and everything 
so you , relatively clear air . 
but , uh , 
well , i don't know about you , 
but i've always considered automobiles to be , probably the prime contributor . 
i mean there's a lot of contributors , 
but it seems that automobiles would probably do more than their fair share of that . 
oh , definitely . 
 uh , you know , there are a large number of them on the road . 
they're all , you know , going , 
and a lot of them are in relatively poor repair . 
that's a big issue is , you know , 
a lot of states don't have a , uh , inspection law 
so you get a lot of people out there without e t r , emission control systems on their cars and things like that . 
oh , even where you do have the inspections , you know , the inspection is once a year . 
and it's like , 
you get the car that's in the accident 
and muffler falls off or something 
 and guy keeps driving along for long period of time after that . 
i guess , from what i hear , though , uh , next year ford is coming out with their electric cars . 
they're actually coming out with the first prototypes in california . 
and i think also some of the , uh , car companies are coming out with , uh , gas powered fleets 
natural gas powered rather than , uh , gasoline . 
i'm hoping that comes along quick .
uh , i was reading an article in time the other day about the ozone layer and how fast that's going 
and i guess it's really disappearing a lot quicker than people realize 
and i know to gasoline or to , you know , carbon monoxide so much as the c f c s 
it is coming from cars , though . 
uh , yeah , 
i think that's a contributor definitely . 
i mean , the , uh , car air conditioners is 
i guess right now and russia have kind of taken the lead in terms of eliminating c f c production , 
well , it , 
go ahead . 
it's the type of thing there that , uh , you know , 
the third world countries are less industrial 
and they want to become industrial 
 so they're on the different part of the cycle of the u s . 
the u s used , you know , all the air pollution stuff and air polluting technologies to get where it is today . 
and that's one of the arguments that the third world countries have been using is , that basically they don't want to have to pay for our mistakes if that makes any sense . 
uh , in terms of , 
where we 
uh , yeah , those are joining arguments , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
that's kind of an interesting situation there . 
uh , those third world countries , what they don't realize is how quickly the ozone is depleting . 
i guess the latest figures are up to fifty percent at the poles 
and near the equator as like florida and cuba and those places . 
so it's kind of an interesting situation . 
it's  , not a real good one actually . 
well , you also have the very close related thing of the , uh , rain forest destruction 
you don't get that source of cleansing anymore . 
have you been in big cities a long time ? 
so you've got , 
those are actually areas that are hit pretty hard , i would think . 
well , not as hard as some places out west because you don't get the , uh , major pollution sources as you do out in denver with the 
denver's  definitely  
that's one of the worst . 
denver's that real good , uh , example of sitting in a valley , kind of like mexico city does , i guess . 
mexico city is historically been one of the worst 
but i've been pretty lucky , 
i've lived in cities that really haven't had that much of a problem , although , uh , i'm really kind of based in orlando , florida 
and there , you can tell that it's getting worse . 
i mean , definitely it's not at a level comparable to los angeles or denver 
but you can , 
there , it's almost all automobiles because there's not that much in the way of 
and there's not that much in terms of public transportation down there . 
there is , 
but it's , 
are you into the cowboys ? 
oh , god , no .
uh , no , 
i haven't been , 
i grew up in dallas but i'm still not a cowboys' man . 
i like philadelphia eagles . 
oh , yeah ? 
that's my favorite team , 
 uh , now that randall's coming back next season , i hope they'll do a little bit better . 
they didn't do too bad last season . 
but , i hope they can do better . 
how about yourself ? 
well , i don't know . 
i guess i'm kind of a fair weather fan in a lot of respects . 
but , uh , i guess if i have , uh , my druthers , i'd probably go for the seattle seahawks . 
oh , tha , 
i kind of like them . 
that's another one of my favorites . 
they're kind of , 
they're not my favorite totally . 
but i do like them . 
i like , 
seahawks are good . 
now that steve largent is gone , i kind of lose a little bit for them 
to be honest with you , i probably watch , uh , college a little bit more than i do pro . 
i kind of like college actually . 
quite a bit . 
that's kind of strange . 
it's too much running for me in college football . 
i like 
is it ? 
they do , you know , 
it's more high tech , 
more , you know , players are apt to act a little bit different when it's a job and not just , you know 
 when you're getting paid millions to do it , i think they take it to another level . 
but i can see it's more , you know , grunted out , run the ball type . 
college football is a little bit different 
you probably wouldn't like my favorite team in college then . 
who's that ? 
notre dame  ? 
nebraska .
there's a running team . 
that's boring for me . 
i'll take the passing teams any day . 
 well , i can see definitely how you get into that . 
that too much running gets pretty boring as well 
it's four yards , three yards 
 you know , it gets kind of monotonous . 
after awhile , just to 
 well , i think they're starting to realize that . 
a lot of like the big eight teams that used to run so much . i think they're starting to realize that they just can't compete anymore . 
it's high dollar . 
you know , it's all money now . 
even college is all 
 so , uh , what's d , 
this world league is coming in ? 
have you followed that very much 
i don't think anything will ever take over the n f l . 
i think 
it's like if we tried to start something to take over major league baseball . 
i just , you know . 
i mean , it can take over part of it . 
but it's never going to be the next , 
it can take over a small market share 
but nothing really , 
  it's going to take a little bit . 
some people are going to watch it 
but it's not going to be wide spread super bowl and every sunday afternoon or anything , you know . 
that standard 
i think i agree with you . 
uh , to see their claim of , you know , like world football . 
but , when in reality , it's really americans playing somewhere else .
it's kind of strange . 
uh , i guess we're the only ones ,
everybody else still nuts over soccer 
actually , uh , i kind of like soccer . 
but , uh , i like the idea . 
it's an interesting game to watch . 
that and rugby . 
i've like to watch ,
or australian rules football . 
whatever you want to call it there . 
that's some brutal stuff there . 
that's worse than football as far as violence i think . 
those guys kill each other out there . 
rugby is something else . 
yeah ,   .
there's definitely an element of stupidity in there somewhere .
that's just wild . 
that's why it's a big college thing . 
rugby is definitely big in college 
because it's something a bunch of fraternity guys can get together and get a good beer buzz going and do .
 so , yeah , 
i could see the feel for that . 
but it's fun to play . 
i'll give it that . 
you've played it then ? 
but , you know , i don't think rugby will ever be professional 
no i doubt it , you know . 
you can't stay healthy and do that . 
that's a rough game . 
it is . 
but , uh , i don't know . 
i don't know how my eagles are going to do this year . 
so you , 
the seahawks are an up and down kind of team . 
they really are . 
do you know where that is ? 
uh , no 
to tell you the truth , i'm , 
it's a small town . 
it's about two hours , 
it's in like central minnesota . 
it's a couple of hours , uh , west of minneapolis . 
but , uh , 
to tell you the truth , i'm not even really from here . 
you just live there now . 
i'm up here for a year on an internship . 
well he's , 
but i actually live in florida . 
live in florida . 
like the seahawks .
and i still like , 
 i mean , i guess i could go for miami 
i'm from , 
i root for nebraska 
so i don't have a real love for miami anyway . 
but , i don't know , 
i guess , i get , into pretty much , 
what do you think ? .
well , uh , i can't be terribly authoritative on what life was like thirty years ago , uh , because i'm not that old yet . 
i can be , 
but go ahead .
 uh , i know that , uh , 
i mean obviously you look of social change . 
i mean uh , you didn't have video games . 
you didn't have home computers . 
you didn't have xerox machines . 
i mean , uh , you try to , 
you go into a business today 
and , you try to imagine the whole thing except running off of carbon paper 
and it's almost inconceivable now because the xerox machines a part of the way we live . 
we fax 
 and    , 
we don't even wait for the mail anymore . 
yeah , uh , 
a business associate of mine was talking about how it used to be where you would send things through the mail 
and you had to do something , 
this was concerning the s e c , 
and so if they had business to do , they had to finish it , you know , three days in advance so they could get it through the mail . 
and because of that , these quote , unquote convenience type items have made work that much more intense and that much harder . 
because you're expected to work on stuff up until the last minute . 
and i recently read an article on just this , that said stress today is so much worse .
it should be less because we have a microwave 
and our grandmothers had to bake brownies 
and we can throw them in a microwave for two minutes 
but the more conveniences we have , the more that's expected of us 
 and we have no down time . 
like we don't stop and wait for things to happen because we don't have to . 
so we keep moving . 
we don't stop and wait for the things to bake and this to happen and that to happen . 
we just hit buttons and keep going to the next thing . 
so we have no relaxation time in between 
 so they say that's really a bad thing . that you need to learn a lot of ways your time in between things . 
so that's good . 
that's an interesting point . 
but i just think our family lives have changed drastically . 
and i think that's ju , 
of course a part of it is technology . 
i mean our kids , where would they be without nintendo and , you know , their t v shows 
and no , 
some of that is really bad i think . 
but , we have all single families . 
so many single families now . 
uh , a lot of working , 
both parents are working . 
so there's a whole big effect on our kids 
and not very many of my daughter's friends really are on their original mother and father . 
you know , i'm wondering what this is going to do in ten and twenty years . 
well , there's that 
and there's the fact that , you know , nowadays fewer and fewer couples are deciding to have kids which generally tends to happen . 
i mean the u s would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we ,
and i'm an o b nurse 
and that's never really occurred to me but that's interesting . 
i never really thought about it that way . 
i saw the numbers on that awhile back 
that's true . 
well , uh , 
we don't know that yet .
 i don't know either . 
that's true . 
 and they're going to be really struggling 
and i don't think that america is currently the type of environment where struggling up from the bottom is necessarily considered to be good .
i mean , it's no longer that it once was 
and not that many people are really trying i don't think .
that's kind of scary . 
huh . well that's true . 
but , i , 
it's just very different 
and i guess every ten years it's just been very different . 
so . and i don't know what's going to happen . 
uh , i know what i'm seeing here at my job is that people are having their children much later in life 
and they've got their homes 
and they've got , 
do you have any special interest in , uh , space flight ? 
oh yeah . 
ever since i was a young and , uh , used to watch the old , uh , apollo missions going off in , uh , classroom t v s . 
uh , i suspect a lot of people , uh , uh , got , uh , turned on by watching those go off . 
uh , very exciting . 
the , uh , uh , 
wanted very much , uh , to , uh , be somehow involved in all that .
of course , i've really wanted to actually manage to get into space someday . 
but , uh , that seems rather unlikely at this point , unfortunately . 
what do you do now ? 
uh , computer programmer .
unfortunately , that can be done from the ground .
to bad , huh . *[[spelling: too
made the wrong career choice to get up into space .
the , uh , uh , 
i used to think stuff in space than we do now . 
uh , frustrating at times . 
i don't know what you think about all that . 
well , uh , uh , i'm kind of young . 
i'm only twentytwo 
and so , uh , uh , i'm not , you know , 
there's a lot that's happened in my lifetime as far as , uh , you know , with the space shuttle and all . although plans to , uh , go to other planets have somewhat been thwarted in comparison to , uh , the sixties . 
uh , although i have a  , 
it would be great 
well , the , uh , uh , 
i've always , uh , felt that , uh , uh , one of the longterm solutions that , at least a few of our problems would be to have , uh , some sort of , uh , solar power satellites up . 
uh , because that's a , uh , you know , that doesn't require , uh , uh , any particularly nasty environment impact . 
and you can just get as much power as you need up there . 
it's just a matter of how big you build it . 
uh , and , of course , the side effects of this is that you have to have , uh , lunar mining bases and space stations and easy transport into space and no   things that i think we should be doing . 
so the side effects of doing that which i think would be good , you know , very , very good some of the other things i'd like to see happen would happen also , 
so i'm , 
it seems like , uh , there's , 
so you're talking about positive side effects then . 
i understand . 
that makes a lot of sense . 
the only problem is , of course , that , uh , that requires significant commitment 
and they want to do the research 
the only commitments that they're interested in making or even talking about are ones for flash value like , uh , the trip to mars .
but the same money could probably be far better spent on , uh , uh , lunar bases and solar power satellite research and , you know , so forth . 
it would be being done for the , uh , glitz and show factor 
we should eventually send people to mars but not just because it's glitzy to do so . 
we should do it for the return we get for it . 
and , uh , unfortunately , that's not what i thinks happened  . *[[listen
least not , 
  for the glitz if the side effects were useful , like the , uh , 
but , uh 
the downside of that is after you do one of those , people say well we did it . 
now let's 
now we're done . 
no need to play around with this space stuff anymore . 
that's what happened with apollo . 
i think you're right . 
i would too . 
i'd , uh , 
was it john denver that tried to buy his way on to the space shuttle ? 
invaded anytime recently ? 
uh , uh , you have solicitation calls . 
that's the only thing that bothers me . 
that's not really invading my privacy .
uh , do you feel that yours is invaded ? 
uh , no 
uh , you know , i would , 
or whatnot 
and , you know , next thing you know , uh , someone calls and wants to sell you this or that 
and it's real hard to tell them , you know , that you're not interested . 
or you do tell them you're not interested 
and they still keep asking you , you know , and keep badgering you about it , 
and that aggravates me . 
but i don't know that you could call that invading my privacy 
because , you know , if we don't want that to happen all we have to do is just call the phone company and say , look , you know , i want my name unlisted or want my , you know , 
 but that doesn't work . 
it doesn't ? 
uh , no , 
they get your name from , uh , if you enter any type of contest or anything . 
uh , you know , you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something , 
you put your phone number on there , 
they pass your phone number on to another company . 
uh , or you , uh , 
 and stuff . 
the newspapers here even call people who already subscribe .
and , uh , while i was subscribing to the paper , i got so upset at them that they 
you call me one more time , i'm going to stop subscribing .
and the number from their list 
and , uh , yeah , 
you call up during regular hours 
 uh , they have a special department , 
they'll take your numbers out of their lists . 
uh , but the , uh , orlando paper , uh , yeah , they refused to take it off of the lists 
and they call every month . 
and when you have more than one phone number , you get a call on each number you have .
good grief . 
here's something that , uh , has been kind of concerning me lately . 
my fiance received a bill from a lord and taylor company , 
uh , you know , they're a department store . 
she received a bill from them , uh , that she had visited some sto , 
and i think it was there in florida , 
maybe it was in miami . 
that , uh , she had visited a store there 
and , uh , they had this bill , uh , that she had bought such and such amount of merchandise , uh , over two hundred dollars worth of merchandise . 
uh , and the date that she supposedly made this purchase , she was in denver with me for thanksgiving . 
uh , and apparently what had happened is someone used her social security number . 
uh , uh , uh , that this is a common occurrence where people are using s , you know , 
they use joe blow's social security number , uh , and can , uh , potentially ruin someone's credit . 
if you know a person's social security number and their mailing address , and their mother's maiden name  , 
uh , if the purchase was made mail order , they should have a record of where it was shipped to 
 and since it wasn't shipped to her address , she could prove , you know , that it wasn't her . 
uh , if it was  some  you know , coming into the store and stuff , then whoever made the purchase would have  had  find some kind of , uh , you know , document 
 and , uh , wh , 
the signature , uh , 
they should be able to provide you a copy with that signature 
and if they can't provide a signature , you know , they'll have to eat the charge .
 well , y , 
 but if the pers , has , you know , what is it , it's telecredit or something ? 
uh , because she won't be able to cash checks because most places verify through there . 
she probably won't be able to open a checking account or anything without a lot of hassle . 
well , we got it cleared up eventually . 
what happened , uh , 
have you ever gotten one of those calls that is either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list 
is that one that you're talking about . 
i work weird hours , 
and invariably just about the time , i'm going to sleep , the phone tears off the wall . 
and you are trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone , 
as soon as you say hello , you hear the click of the recording coming on , 
or you hear somebody all ready starting , reading off a list of stuff that they've read probably a thousand times that day already . 
that's true , 
or the ones that are generated by a computer . 
it's just a computer voice that comes on the line . 
those are the ones that i really , really hate too . 
i've even had some of them , 
they're voice activated 
and you've got to say hello twice before they'll do anything . 
sometimes i get them on my , uh , answering machine at home 
and i hate that when i've got a whole bunch of messages 
and i go through them 
and most of them aren't from anybody at all . 
what i would love to see done to stop all of this , 
we've got a thing in this country , 
you can have your phone number unlisted , 
and i think a law should be passed to where any of these people , 
i think it's great , that you know , freedom of speech in this country and everything , 
but if they're going to offer these services , or these recorded message , everything , they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them . 
see i have an unlisted telephone number , 
but i still get all of those calls 
and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i don't even understand . 
so , yeah , 
i really feel that's , uh , an invasion of my privacy . 
i agree with you on that particular subject there . 
let me see . 
that's about , that as far as any other everyday occurrences , 
i put a stop to some of them as far as the door to door , either religious groups , or people peddling products . 
if i wanted their products , i would have either gone to the store to bought it , 
or i would have called for their salesman to come out . 
that's true . 
living in an apartment complex though , you know um , you can't really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations , uh , 
but they still come up to the front door and , uh , you know , walk around . 
so , usually what i do is i'll call the apartment manager and tell them hey , there's people coming around , you know , 
and they're trying to sell something 
or they're from a religious organization 
and i really hate that . 
i really , really do . 
i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago 
and , uh , gosh it was about nine o'clock at night , too . 
it wasn't even what i would consider , you know , family hours , 
time to , you know , start going to bed 
uh , and it was somebody from , um , oh what was it , the , uh , jesus christ of latter day saints , 
and uh , i've read a lot about , uh , that particular sect 
and i don't particularly care for it , 
so i especially don't like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me . 
now , i agree with their right to , uh , pursue their religion of choice , in whatever manner they want to , 
but i think they should also respect the sanctity of the american home , whether it be in a house or in an apartment . 
i'm on my turf , 
if i want them there , i'll call for them , 
otherwise , i don't want to know they exist . 
i agree with you there . 
if they want to choose that particular religion that's fine with me too , you know , as long as they don't try and pull me in and drag me in . 
and i don't like the way that they do it either , 
and , it's their mission that they do it . 
they go door to door 
and they go out into the public 
and they actually have the , uh , teenagers serving two years you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work 
and , uh , i don't know , 
i just , um , don't particularly care for that at all . 
and uh , you know , to try and get me to join or , you know , become interested in their religion , 
because i have my own . 
now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting , 
i've even gone so far as to put that , 
i've got a storm door on the front of the house 
and i've put , in , 
i don't know how much clearer it can be , 
it's a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting . 
i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise , cause i still get , 
that's true , 
i didn't go that far 
but , uh , yeah 
i probably could do the same thing , uh , you know , 
i don't have a storm door , 
but i'm sure i could rig up something . 
but you know i don't think that that would stop people . 
it's like they see that word 
and it says go  , instead of stop . 
and do , 
well that would be technically illegal , 
it would be harassment . 
 oh gosh . 
but , i consider an invasion of my privacy ,
that's true , 
that's true , um . 
well what else ? 
i believe we've pretty much summed everything up . 
i know , 
but i remember you talked about something , 
you started off and said , 
well let me think , 
you talked about the telephone calls and people coming and soliciting and selling things at the door . 
you said something else . 
i can't remember what it was , 
that kind of touched a nerve right there , 
but uh , we got to talking about the , uh , uh , people coming to you at the front door . 
i'm drawing a blank . 
pretty close . 
well i've enjoyed talking with you . 
well it was nice talking to you too jim . 
and take it easy now . 
good night . 
so we've got to talk about music . 
not a seventies baby . 
so that's really what i like better , 
is that kind of music  , 
i mean , 
is it disco , 
or is it like , 
oh , okay . 
 so they can get like the doors and led zepplin . 
that's cool . 
and , how about the rolling stones ? 
oh , sure , 
i went to their concert last year when they were here . 
oh , toured . 
how about , um , pink floyd ? 
we got some same things 
well , i just didn't know that much about music 
and i wasn't sure what kind of music . 
it's very hard 
because , see , well , i mean , in the whole spectrum i'd rather listen , you know , 
i listen to heavy metal or classic rock . 
what kind of heavy metal are we talking about ? 
we're talking about what they call hard rock . 
like , give me some examples . 
like , for example , let's see , uh , bad company , 
oh , well , bad company's not bad , 
that's not , 
well , they're like , for example , a c d c . 
a c d c .
have you heard of them ? 
and , stuff like that . 
well , okay . 
i guess i didn't really consider that heavy metal . 
i mean , i'm thinking about like cinderella , you know . 
well , cinderella is hard rock , heavy metal . 
well , see , i don't really care for cinderella .
but , i like a c d c's okay . 
but , see , for example , they have , see what , 
but other bands consider it like really hard rock . 
it's like brash metal , which all they do is like , they have this guitar and they just bang at the guitar , 
and the guitar is set like , really low , 
i don't really care for that too much , i guess . 
and , what happens is like , oh , everybody gets like totally into the music 
and then they start dancing around , 
and they just bump into each other , 
 like they hit each other with their shoulders , 
and , then , you knock people down , 
and what you do is , you also try to get up on stage and jump down on top of all these other people . 
is that the kind of music that you like ? 
oh , okay . 
but , that's what they do . 
that's what some people call like really heavy metal . 
oh , okay . 
and , see , the difference , i guess , between hard rock and heavy metal is the lyrics also . 
like really , like heavy metal , is considered , like the words heavy metal 
and , like , you always thought about , like , suicide . and killing people and stuff like that . 
and , just hard rock has , 
they don't talk about that , 
they just talk about , like , life in general . 
like , queen's reich , if you ever heard of them . 
you're talking queen , 
is that what you said ? 
well , no . 
oh , oh , oh , okay , 
so because , 
well sure , 
because queen was real popular when i was growing up . 
especially , uh , oh god , what is it , a night at the opera ? 
don't they have a , 
let's see , the one that they have the whole opera singing in the background . 
bohemian rhapsody . 
that was great . 
i heard that the other day on the radio 
and i pumped it up . 
because , i mean , i just love that song . 
that was a real good one . 
but they had , 
that whole record was pretty good . 
but then , they started going downhill like everybody else . 
well , that's true . 
they came up with some pretty weird stuff after that . 
they're still around , 
they've got a new c d out , 
but i wouldn't buy it . 
because see , what happens is , the old , see whe , 
i like the old rolling stones . 
i don't like the new stuff . 
of the stones ? 
i agree . 
that's the ne , 
the older stuff is the best of it . 
the new stuff's kind of more like , today's rock and roll , which i ,
well , for example , i used to like old phil collins . 
i agree . 
and then he came out with , uh , see , for example , his record like , no jacket required . 
that was good , 
but it was on his way of going downhill , 
and then he came out with the invisible touch , with , uh , genesis 
and that really , 
like now , i hate phil collins , 
i can't stand him . 
because , i look at him 
and you were great , 
and now you're singing all this stuff that , doesn't matter what you sing or what you record , 
it's still going to be a number one hit . 
and so , that's what gets me mad . 
but , did you go see that new doors movie ? 
i guess i've been , kind of considering it . 
have you seen it yet ? 
was it really good ? 
and , they both loved the movie , right ? 
it took me back to the sixties , and stuff like that . 
but i'm going to give it thumbs down . 
and they go , 
but why ? 
because like , the end is , like , really depressing . 
and so , 
 like the movie is so well made , 
and the music that goes with it just picks you up , see , 
i was born in nineteen hundred sixtynine . 
oh , okay . 
 i mean , so for me , 
so , you didn't really grow up with that kind of music then . 
but you learn to . 
i mean it's just that , like the sixties music's got a lot to say . 
i never found out what a lot of the seventies music had too . 
you know , i was like , 
well no , 
i've never liked disco . 
but i bet you were out there with your bell bottomed pants , 
that's true . 
but , i was more in the late seven , 
well , i shou , 
like mid to late seventies , like between seventyfive and , 
did you go to college ? 
well , no . 
oh , that's cool . 
but uh , no 
but see , i graduated high school in seventyeight , 
so , you know , in seventyeight , you know rock was starting to get really heavy , you know , 
and real , um , 
disco was pretty much dead by then . 
 so that's what i mean , 
disco wasn't really my time . 
well , they always say that the seventies was the lowest point in progression , ever in history . 
about music ? 
about everything . 
oh . okay . 
so , it's like , nothing happened during the seventies . 
everything happened during the sixties , 
the seventies i don't know what they're called , you know , 
it's like 
or , you know , like the technology years ,
but the seventies got nothing . 
i mean , nobody cared to name it .
that's kind of funny .
you're right . 
i never thought of that . 
the disco years , that's what they're calling them ,
i know . 
can you imagine like a big picture of john travolta , tada , what is it saturday night fever ? 
him just standing there . 
that's a good example to look for in history . 
well , from now on we're going to go from nineteen sixtynine when they took the first step on the moon , to nineteen eighties . 
what happened in the middle ? 
don't worry , 
don't worry , 
 you're not missing anything , you know , 
that's true . 
and , that's , 
you know with , 
it's like they don't want to talk about that , 
so they just , don't name it . 
i mean , i guess it was pretty bad times . 
well , that's very true .
oh , well , let's see , 
oh , good . 
uh what are you doing ? 
do you have a family ? 
uh , yeah . 
i was kind of in the middle of supper , 
but it's not a big deal , 
oh , i'm sorry . 
i just left it . 
it's okay , 
because see i didn't , see 
oh , okay . 
and so , you know , it's okay . 
so then , uh , have fun doing this . 
it is not ,
bye , bye . 
i do not live in a city . 
i live in a real small little place . 
where is that ? 
uh , it's about thirty miles from sherman . 
it's north of sherman . 
well , you live almost in oklahoma .
 yeah  .
that's kind of ironic , because i don't live too far from oklahoma either . 
you know where saint joe is ? 
i'm about eight miles south of it . 
oh , yeah . 
i had been through saint joe , 
but , um ,  just as far as  watching the news and reading the papers and all that , it sounds like the crimes in the cities are really getting bad . 
well , you know , i've seen those statistics and everything , 
and you know , what frightens me , is that , you put a half a million people out in the middle of the desert 
i mean , the iraqis didn't have a lot of hightech weaponry , 
but they had mortars and machine guns ,
oh , yeah . 
and , they didn't kill as many people in fortyfive days , 
and they were intending to kill people , 
i mean , that was their job , as they killed in washington d c . 
oh , i know , 
um , i think nowadays people really just , murder is nothing to them , you know . 
well , i formulated a pretty radical theory over the last ten years , i guess . 
and , i've come to the conclusion , and this is a pretty scary thought to me , even , that if a guy is convicted , or a gal is convicted , of a crime , rather than put them in prison , because prison's proven not to work , just let them go . 
say okay , you're convicted 
 and just let them go 
 and if they get convicted again , well , just kill them . 
because , uh , most likely that will happen , won't it , that , you know , 
well , i think that the best hope to eliminate crime , as we know it today 
if someone is known to have been in prison , they can't get a job . 
you know . 
they can't be accepted into society . 
you know , if they're not going to be accepted into society , then  everybody's  going to become sociopathic . 
and , you know , who's to put the limit on it ? 
i mean , i was watching a thing last night , up in washington state . 
if you get convicted of , uh , sexual offenses , on a regular basis .
you know , i mean , some of these guys are forty years old and got ten convictions . 
and they're still let out on the street after one or two years . 
well , in washington state , if you're a habitual sexual offender , they just don't let you out . 
so you serve your prison term , 
and then you go into the mental hospital , 
and if you're pronounced cured , they'll let you go . 
well , they may find a cure for it , 
but there is no known cure now . 
um . so you're kind of thinking , 
in other words , if you do something the first time , that's not real bad , you know , 
 hey   , people make mistakes . 
to go ahead and let them go , 
but if they do it again and they really need to face the consequences then , uh . 
well , yeah , 
 use  that 
or , you know , there's other consequences rather than killing them , you know , 
you could ,
you know . 
at least they might get some benefit in that , 
and if the people they committed a crime against , feel , at some later date , that these people have learned their lesson , are okay , you know , well , they can free them . 
but , uh , you know , with the technology we have today , you can put a collar on a guy's leg that will knock him down if they leave the property . 
i mean , it will just in incapacitate them . 
and , you can put a collar around a guy's leg that will prohibit them from committing any kind of prohibitive act . 
but , you know , putting them in prison , my god , that doesn't work . 
apparently not , 
because look how many years they've been doing that 
and look  , 
i mean , yeah . 
well , you look at places like turkey . 
turkey has the death penalty ,
i mean , if you get convicted of , uh , you know , drug trafficking , they just kill you . 
you get convicted of , uh , you know , heinous crimes , they just kill you . 
i mean there's no two ways about it . 
and , uh , you look at their society 
and the repeat offenders are very few . 
you know , and you look at our society , almost everyone out on the street that has been in prison , has been in prison three or four times . 
three or four times , 
i mean , 
that is true , 
i know . 
one , you need to make it illegal for both parents to work while the kids are under seven . 
i think that's very important . 
oh , i agree very much so on that , 
and then , if a parent has proved to be unfit , for any reason 
because , you know , we are what we teach . 
because that's what our society becomes . 
we have , 
that environment for quite a few years when i was doing construction work . 
you know , and these guys , they come to work every morning 
and they're stoned to the bone . 
and they work all day , 
and they go home 
and they smoke their dope and drink their booze and shoot their drugs 
and when they run out of money , they go down to the corner store and pop the guy on the head and take his money , 
and then they go back to work on monday . 
and , the kids of these people   .
they're sociopathic . 
and i worked in a first grade classroom for one full semester 
 and these kids were more foulmouthed than i've ever been . 
i had one kid threaten my life , 
in the first grade .
told me that daddy's going to whoop me to death . 
oh , know .
you know , and they flipping me the finger and all that 
 and i just said to this kid , 
you can step into mainstream society 
or you can die . 
because you will eventually be killed . 
and , i'm just totally aghast at a what's going on . 
oh , i know . 
i know , um , 
i work in school . you know , 
that's something i do 
and it really is 
 i'm like you  
astonishing what the younger ages know , 
and they react to what they see at home . you know . 
if they see violence at home , that's what you're going to get from the kids at school . 
you know . it really is , 
and that's kind of sad . 
well , you can see it in the work place , you know . 
used to be when you had a personality conflict you worked with it 
and you got through it . 
now , you know , people get fired , 
or what's even worse , is they promote them into a position that they can't handle and let them get fired . 
or , one thing or the other . 
you look at another kind of society like the japanese . 
you put that many people on that small of a space , they've learned to live together . 
it's in their culture . 
and one of the things that's in their culture that i really think the major corporations should pay attention to , is the fact that , while japan was becoming a great power , financially , the people that worked for those companies , worked for the same company they worked for at sixtyfive , as they did when they were eighteen . 
teen . 
and the company , took it upon itself to find a position for these people . 
if they weren't fit for the job they were hired for , they didn't just can them , 
they made a position for them some where . 
you look at frito lay . 
my wife used to work for frito lay as a typist . 
you know , transcribing stuff into the computer . 
well , she could type about onehundred and five words per minute , 
but she don't like it . 
she just doesn't like to do that . 
i mean , she will . 
but , you know , her preference is to be  . . . 
um , what kind of hobbies do you have ? 
um , i do a lot of crossstitching and painting , when i do have spare time . 
i like crossstitch too . 
oh , i love it . 
i just have a hard time finding any spare time lately . 
that's my case also . 
i've got a new born 
and there's just no time . 
have you been crossstitching long ? 
oh , several years . 
my husband is even interested in it now . 
he likes to help me design , um , you know , projects that are ,
oh , really . 
he looks at the pattern 
not that hard . 
oh , it's not . 
i really enjoy it . 
i do a lot of my own patterns also . 
in fact , i did one , bill the cat , you know , from  glenn county  
oh , yeah . 
it was tough , 
but , uh , yeah . 
do you have any others , 
um , i do mostly that , um , 
not very artistic really for like painting and stuff . 
oh , uhhuh . 
but , now i don't know . 
i'm still trying to get all the d m c colors .
oh , really .
i've got the kits to put them all in . 
i don't have them all yet 
i got to counting the other day 
and , uh , i think i have , what was it two hundred , 
and i got to thinking the money that i've got invested in this is , uh , 
 yeah , it can add up quick . 
oh , yeah . 
i just keep an inventory of what i currently have , 
and then when i start a new project , i go through and see if i , you know , 
just buy the colors that i need 
i see . 
well , now can i improvise with adding and using another color instead , you know , what comes close .
a lot of times you can do that . 
i think , i 
the pinks , there's like fortytwo different shades of pink . 
good grief .
there's lots of pinks and greens . 
pinks and greens . 
there's lots of shades of greens . 
but the colors , 
i just love all the different colors . 
they had quite a few new ones come out last year , that they added to . 
but , you don't have much spare time either ? 
oh , yes . 
and that does take some time . 
and if we're trying to get acclimated uh , with having a baby , 
and   .
how old ? 
he's seven months old . 
oh , yeah . 
and just into everything , 
so there's not a spare moment . 
oh , but i wouldn't trade it for the world . 
i've been trying to do some bibs for him .
oh , yeah . 
we missed it last year , 
so hopefully this year he'll have one . 
well , last year he was a little bit young for having one . 
he wouldn't have enjoyed it anyway .
you would have 
if it tasted good , yeah . 
all he liked was the lights this year , 
oh , yeah . 
oh , well , that's neat that you like crossstitching also . 
that's kind of strange that we got the same call . 
it's a   call . 
oh , i'm sorry . 
go ahead . 
that's okay . 
okay  , uh , 
but , yeah , 
i've been doing it for probably ten years or so . 
oh , wow . 
i just started about , well , five years ago , i think . 
but it is peaceful , 
i mean it is relaxing to do , once you find the time to do it . 
there's also a couple of large projects , baby afghans , 
and i got one done 
and i think the child is going to be in high school before i get finished . 
on that , uh 
 bear thing  .
is it one of those afghans that i've seen in the packages with the large squares ? 
well , yeah 
 uh , i didn't buy a kit . 
oh , uhhuh . 
well i've seen the afghans in the stores that are designed for crossstitching . 
it's that cloth . 
oh , okay . 
it's cloth i think . 
and it has the borders and everything already . 
those are pretty . 
number one turned out just great , 
and the lady said she couldn't believe that they know that i had done it in the colors , that they had decorated the nursery 
and i didn't even know it . 
oh , that's a   .
i gave it to her 
that was a good   .
it worked out that way . 
that's great . 
uh , that , uh , 
now i've got the material to do an afghan that i just never did get around to finishing it . 
i like those . 
those are pretty . 
oh , no . 
she hung it on the wall . 
my , uh , grandmother , um , made us a couple of quilts for the baby , 
uh , they're just too nice . 
i mean you don't get many hand made quilts anymore . 
oh , yeah . 
well , i've enjoyed this . 
but , uh , well keep up the good , um , 
keep up the crossstitching . 
you too . 
all right , 
bye bye . 
bye bye . 
i was trying to think about some of my favorite people that i liked in music 
and none of them are recent , right . 
so i like gordon lightfoot , 
do you know who he is ? 
 and the moody blues , 
and i like to listen to piano music a whole lot , 
and willie nelson . 
so you like a variety . 
sort of easy listening because you like country 
but then , 
i don't like that ,
i don't know . 
i just like willie nelson i guess because he's such a character . 
oh , uhhuh . 
i like some of his songs , though . 
they're not so sad country all the time . 
they're just kind of sweet sometimes . 
you know , i mean they're not the typical country where they're just , you know , my wife left me , my dog left me , you know .
my truck is broken down . 
and my house just burned down , you know . 
there's a guy , 
have you ever heard of george winston , 
he plays piano . 
i think he's dead now , 
but he plays wonderfully . 
i like that . 
do you play the piano , 
or you just like it ? 
i've got a piano , 
my mother got a piano 
and , uh , vowed that someone in the family was going to learn , 
so we all had to take lessons , 
and i was the one that did the least poorly , 
so she gave it to me . 
and it's sitting here mostly taking up space , 
but sometimes it makes you feel good to sit down and play it . 
it is real relaxing . 
it must be fun to be able to play it 
and , you know , if you can play tunes that people can sing along to it'd be kind of fun , i think . 
 because i mean , i play the flute 
and not many things you can play you know , people will sit there and sing along to 
and you can't sing along either 
 but , uh , i like a lot , uh , 
i like classical music just because of the , 
when , i don't play , 
i like jazz music 
but  , 
oh , so do i . 
what's that ? 
forgot about that . 
what's that ? 
i forgot about jazz .
i like a lot , like , 
i like , uh , is it the new age music , like with , uh , uh , the , 
i don't know if you've heard neurotic collection . 
i love them . 
i love those , too . 
they're just so relaxing . 
i'd never heard them before until i went in a music store 
and you know how you put the headphones on and listen to it 
 and i heard a piece 
and it was just so wonderful . 
and then even my eleven year old boy loves to listen to it . 
isn't that nice . 
i mean it's nice when you have a piece so peaceful ,
and , uh , you know , it has pieces that are uplifting , 
but , it's mostly relaxing 
and because it doesn't have words , you know , you don't feel like , there's anything you have to remember , you know , as far as singing a song or something like that or interpreting what they mean 
 but , uh , 
i mean you can just sit , 
you know those little booklets that come along with it 
 and you can just see the things that they're trying to show with music . 
my little boy has gotten so into it that 
he's identified the people that have written certain songs , 
then he buys the pieces that have that person .
oh , i see what you're saying . 
i mean , i don't even know who did which ones , 
but he does . 
i can't identify them either . 
i just like them . 
i know which ones come next , 
but i don't even know their names . 
most of them i don't know their names of the song , 
but i can identify them . 
but i like that 
and i like classical music . 
and , uh , 
were you in the band ? 
so was i . 
 and i was in , like , chamber music groups and stuff , 
so i'm used to pieces 
and i played classical flute , 
i didn't play jazz flute or anything like that , 
so . i can relate to it , i suppose .
i'm like you i like the older stuff , too , 
because i like chicago 
 and  , uh , let me think who , uh , 
you don't know hebert laws , 
but hebert laws a flute player , 
he's a jazz flute player 
and i like , uh , uh , chuck mangione , 
do you know who chuck mangione is ? 
i like chuck mangione .
trying to think of all , uh , oh , 
i like the moody blues . 
did you like them ? 
i like mostly the older groups i think . 
oh , c , 
but we do have , 
i like simply red , 
we got simply red . 
i figure all our c ds that we have what i really like .
and , uh , i like breeze , 
i like the group . 
i think just because uh , simply red . 
so what type , simply red , 
i've never heard of that . 
is it just instrumental ? 
but it is instrumental . 
but it's got people singing 
but it's got like a whole bunch of people singing . 
you know , how many people are in simply red , stuart  , 
he can't hear me . 
i don't remember how many people , 
but , it's got men and women 
and it's nice , 
i mean it's pleasant , you know , music . 
it's not where it hurts your ears to hear it . 
but it's not like , uh , chicago where it's got that much instrument to it . 
you know , it doesn't have , like all the brass and everything . 
we're going to go to commerce and see a friend . 
oh , you must live in this area . 
where are you ? 
we're in sherman . 
so we're in garland . 
oh , okay . 
you're going to commerce ? 
for east texas or something ? 
oh , okay . 
just because there's a friend up there , 
not because there's much else .
oh , okay . 
well they're having a lot of recruiting this week in all the different areas . 
that's why i was just w , 
for colleges ? 
well , they're not c , 
and they've been doing a lot of that in the area . 
they're not going to recruit me anymore , 
i'm through . 
no more for me . 
no more , huh . 
what do you do ? 
well , right now i'm just a homemaker , 
but i'm going to school , uh , for legal assistant 
and that's what i know , 
and , uh , just nothing basically .
are you going to go to east texas for that ? 
i don't go to east texas . 
i got a degree from t w u , 
but i'm really interested you know , in the legal environment , 
but i don't want to be a lawyer 
so i said well , i think i'll go back to school and see about being a legal assistant . 
that'd probably be pretty interesting . 
i was summonsed down to the courthouse last week . 
they had summonsed eight hundred people , 
about four hundred showed up , 
and it was for a murder trial . 
oh , uhhuh . 
this guy had supposedly , uh , strangled this woman and stuffed cotton toweling down her throat and up her nose .
anyway , this is happened in nineteen eightythree . 
and they had us fill out a long questionnaire . 
we stayed till about one thirty 
and they're going to call the ones that they're interested in from the questionnaire two to three at a time 
and the trial won't take place until june . 
that's how it works . 
and they say it's going to last about two to three weeks . 
and this guy in front of me said , i can't believe i was summonsed . 
i was an investigator 
and i was tailing the woman that was killed . 
well , then i have a friend at school that has a boyfriend that's a lawyer 
and he said that this socialite in plano had hired four guys to kill her husband 
and the one that's accused was the one that actually did it . 
and she has since taken off with another lawyer who had been , uh , getting cocaine from his client and then selling it , 
and he had skipped bail 
and they finally extradited him 
and he's going to testify for the state against her so he'll have his sentence reduced . 
and this is the man that was in front of you ? 
oh , well they'll ,
he got off right away . 
and i wrote that down on my questionnaire that he'd told me that , 
so i figure that that will make me biased 
and i won't be chosen . 
but there's probably something else that might make you . 
because the jury . 
i mean , pretty much a lot of people would know about it , you know , and know some of the different things about it 
but , uh , they might weed you out some other way . 
you know , and you don't believe in 
i said that , i could believe in it in certain instances , but i'd find it hard to levy that against somebody . 
so , see , 
you know . 
because in that instance , then you're always going to say , you know , not gui , 
 uh , that punishment . 
but then when you're picked , 
see i was picked for another murder trial before 
 oh , gosh and it's so hard because , you know , everybody is wanting to go on and get the sentence done , 
and if you're trying to hold out , you know , there's so much pressure on you 
 and you've got to come up with a decision . 
well , especially with something where you have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt . 
you have to find whether they're guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
and it's like , do you really feel that sure about , 
well personally , i don't have any children . 
i'm twentytwo 
and i'm doing my master's at n c state 
oh , uhhuh . 
 so , uh , uh , children wouldn't be very convenient for me right now . 
well , no , 
would they , 
so how do you spend the time with your children ? 
well both of mine are boys . 
and did , 
 and they're into sports 
 i mean , as a matter of fact , that's what we're doing tonight .
what are you doing ? 
baseball has started . 
oh , okay . 
 like , uh , like does the eight year old play baseball ? 
oh , oh , yes , 
in his league do they have like a pitcher , 
up until , 
it's coach pitch , until you get nine 
 so he's going to be with , uh , regular pitching 
oh , okay . 
 and my eleven year old , of course , you know , is pitching . 
i used to play soccer when i was that age 
but yes , 
we're into baseball , 
and it seems like soon as that over with we get into basketball . 
we even have peewee basketball here . 
so there's always something . 
and how about like on the weekends . 
do you do sports 
if we're not doing sports we go somewhere . 
 uh , do you go for long vacations , like a week or something when they have school off ? 
 oh , yeah , 
and where do you go ? 
different places every year . 
have you been out of the country ? 
oh , okay , 
well , first , they always say , get to know your country first before you leave , 
i mean 
when i lived in uh , washington , d c , i never went to the washington memorial , 
and then when i went back to visit , i went to the washington memorial . 
you know , i've heard , we have a couple of friends that goes to washington quite often , 
and that must be the thing . 
they really hadn't either . 
they went to the memorial , you know , 
when they go , it's on business 
it's not really just to getting to sight see . 
well , it's a beautiful city . 
oh , i bet it is , too . 
 but , the problem is  , like first time i went out of here , they took me to las vegas 
 and that was the most boring place on earth . 
oh , now my husband and i , we go different places . 
 but when we go with our children we usually kind of stay close . 
 like , did you go to disneyland ? 
oh , yes , 
 oh , okay . 
so , but um , now , i don't know , 
 um , but let's see , 
when i was eleven i went also to the caribbean . 
and , uh , then after that , i , 
my sister lives in turkey , 
so when i was like fourteen , fifteen , i went to turkey . 
and this christmas , i went to turkey . 
but basically , it's a , 
for the past couple of years , i , 
since my parents are , well , 
i'm from argentina , 
and my parents live down there . 
so , all the traveling i do is alone . 
and , uh , we were never much of , 
uh , a very , uh , family thing , you know , made , like go skiing in vermont or something . 
uh , that was a lot of fun . 
but , what happens is we used to fight a lot , 
so there's never much of a family thing . 
you know , one of those hell family vacations . 
oh , yes , 
but you know , i try , 
my husband also , we're involved in everything our kids does 
 because , uh , my dad died , you know , when i was less than a year old 
 so i always just had a mother . 
so i always thought , when i have kids , you know , i really want to be involved with them . 
well , my dad , all he wanted to do was get money for us , 
so he could buy us material things . 
material things , 
that is , 
and to me , you know , it's like , now i'm twentytwo , 
but i still feel , you know , 
it's like yeah , we never threw a football or something 
 and the way i was brought up , 
and he wants me now , 
you know , like he wants to be best friends now 
best friends , now . 
 and it's very hard for me 
because , you know , it's like you grow up to be twenty years old , 
and it's always the same man 
 and then suddenly he sees that he's getting old , 
and he wants to be best friends 
 but , uh , you know , it's like , i can only express myself so much , 
because , you know , um , everything you know , that my family taught me , which is very hard to change that all of a sudden from one year to the next and say , i'm sorry , you know . 
and let's go out and do things together when i don't feel like it , you know 
 and so , that's that whole thing that he'll say when , like , like 
i've seen my uncle and his family , you know , does everything together , 
and you know , his kids are , you know , 
when his little girl was five years old and everything , uh , they would go to the beach , 
and she could go to sleep at two in the morning 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and , uh , i was brought up the same way , 
it doesn't matter what age you have , 
just so long as you can get up to go to class the next morning , you can stay up 
but what he does is , when he gets home , he separates his work from his house . 
you have to 
 i mean , you honestly do . 
now i have friends that i love to death , 
 and they have children , 
but their children does anything , 
we have to take them , and , you know 
and that really gets kind of aggravating after a while 
but , uh , it's just something that , you know , 
my theory is , you know , you want to do , well , 
what i'll do is , you know , like , 
i mean , you might have problems , 
but it's not your kids' problems 
and you got to try to be with them as much as you can 
and to , you know , like , 
thing if they would ever happen to have a drug problem , suppose , that they could feel comfortable coming to me and saying , i got a problem 
problem , 
first of all you're coming to me 
and let's see how we can get rid of the problem , you know , 
and that's very hard to do , 
because once you're best friends with your parents , then , i think everything go a lot better . 
i agree with you very much so . 
now , we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college , 
and we knew time wise , and money wise , too 
 it would not have been a good idea to had them then . 
 oh well , three kids before he had me , 
so it was , uh , you know , 
you're trying , to support , uh , four kids , 
and it's pretty hard 
but then i wouldn't have you , 
but then you would have a lot of money .
that's right , 
but you can't take this money with us , though 
that's how i keep looking at it . 
but , you know , like , like , especially for me , which i'm paying out of state tuition . 
i'm paying , you know , three thousand , 
what is it , two thousand six hundred dollars for one semester . 
and , you know , people say , you know , it's expensive to think it's college , 
but , if everybody would be a little bit responsible , you know , 
it's like , 
what does it cost . 
it costs five hundred dollars a semester suppose . 
now they go to a state college 
and they live at home 
and well , it costs two hundred dollars for books , 
but you know , seven hundred dollars a semester , 
a lot of people can spare that if they planned ahead , you know , like 
oh , yeah , 
if you can , 
 i mean , it's like , if you plan a year ahead , you can probably save up seven hundred dollars 
what are you learning to be ? 
oh , oh , excuse me ? 
i mean , what are you wanting to do after you get out of college ? 
well , computer engineering . 
oh , that's , 
my husband's into , uh , computers . 
 and now i'm looking for a job before they have to send me back home 
 because since i'm an international student , they want to send me back to 
well , my dad wants me to go back . 
and you don't want to ? 
no , 
no . 
like you don't have any money to , get out . 
 and i get married there , 
and now i have kids there , 
and then i'll never leave the place , you know . 
then you'll never leave . 
i know , 
and that's what happened to my brother . 
he came to school up here , 
and then when he went down there , 
he was just so bad off , you know 
well maybe something will open up for you . 
i've been calling a lot of companies . 
some of them are interested . 
well , at least for a year and a half 
well , may , 
well i've enjoyed talking to you . 
all right , 
same here . 
well , on this subject , i really hadn't had to deal with putting someone in there yet , 
but my mother's always been administrator of a nursing home 
 so i've always been involved , you know , in one . 
how do you feel about them , i mean , since you've 
 well , i've 
i really can . 
uh , nursing homes to me , 
i would personally be the last resort 
well , i've had a touch of experience . 
my , um , dad had emphysema and got to the point where mother couldn't 
if it's a have to thing , 
and , uh , she put him in , 
but he wasn't there very long before he died 
 but , um , i guess , um , the one time that i saw him there , you know , as far as the surroundings , that seemed okay . 
but , um , we kind of thought that maybe they just wanted to give him some medication to sort of , you know 
 and that's always kind of bothered me . 
that's like everything else , though . 
i have a sisterinlaw who runs a nursing home , 
but i've never actually been there 
 and i know that she's the kind of person who wouldn't allow , you know , a lot of the 
but still 
i know , 
i've always , 
well , my sister's involved in one also , 
and i really think they really do a wonderful job . 
but still there's those little things that happens , you know 
there really is , which 
i think , it's a wonderful place , you know , if it comes to that , you know , if you just can't take care of them any more . 
well , sometimes you don't have any other alternative 
that's it . 
other things . 
 but i think when the time comes , i hope to have the time to really look around , you know 
i think that's important , too , 
in fact 
i do too . 
outside's awful deceiving sometimes 
there's one close to where my mother is , 
but in order to get in , you have to be able to , um , walk in on your own , 
in other words , you can't be in , you know , too bad a shape 
but then if you deteriorate , um , they have a separate section for those who need care 
but it's always , well , 
and they have a long waiting list , too . 
so there's always this feeling of , well , golly gee , you know , you've got to be able to walk in the door , 
so you can't wait until you're too bad off 
off , 
 but then , you don't want to go do that when you don't have to 
to , 
and everything you worked so hard for all your life 
 and if you're still capable of driving and doing those things , then you feel like , well , gee , you know , i'm isolating myself 
so that's a hard one , 
but it is a very nice nursing home . 
now there is some really nice ones . 
there's also , you know , some private ones , you know 
 but of course , i would never be able to afford to put my parents in something like that , you know , 
that's the problem 
that's way out of my reach . 
the expense of it all is , 
and , uh , another thing i hate to see is when someone has a small amount of money , and they go into one of these places and they just eat it all up immediately . 
oh , yeah . 
but those who don't have money can go in and get the same care .
the very same , 
so i don't like that aspect . 
but there's , i think there's ways around it , though , that , you know , 
like , they could put it in one of their children's names or something 
but still , a lot of them doesn't feel comfortable doing that . 
you know , it's their money . 
that's right . 
you know , that's how i feel about it , anyway . 
well , yeah , 
i've talked to my mother about that several times lately , 
but , you know , what if . 
my mother's seventy now , 
so naturally she's retired , 
but she's still on her own , i mean . 
my mother's , uh , seventyfive and still has her own home and everything . 
i think that's wonderful , 
i really do , 
just as long as they can , 
and then on the other hand , i've seen some people go into the nursing home and just so happy 
that's true . 
they have a lot of people around to do things with . 
they're not lonely . 
some of those places have wonderful activities and things , you know , lots of stuff going on . 
oh , yes , 
and they'll take them places 
 so . i don't know , 
it's not all bad 
 but i guess once you get ill , then , you know , you really have some problems if you can't get around 
but i really don't know what the other solution would be 
i really don't . 
but no , 
when the time comes hopefully we'll really look around before i decide on one for my parents 
really do , 
because i have been raised in one , you know , 
so there's lot of things i know to look for . 
and i don't think they'd want to go where they used to work , either 
i really don't . 
that might be kind of tough , huh . 
it really would , 
and like i said , my sister's still in it , 
and i really don't think my mother'd want to be there , either . 
well , it's been nice talking to you . 
well , you too . 
and i guess we'd better get back to work , huh . 
all right . 
well , in a normal route of way we do things , how about the ladies go first ? 
all righty .
um , well , i , uh , have a four year old who will just be entering public school next year , 
 so i'm really just starting to get involved uh , in what's out there and how they do things . 
um , as far as the system as a whole , i really don't see a problem with it . 
i do see a problem with graduating people that can't read and are not , you know , productive in society or productive to themselves 
and , uh , i think that's the main problem at this point . 
how about yourself ? 
all right . 
i live in plano , texas 
and , uh , 
so , uh , i mean , when you take , uh , uh , professionals and put them in situations , they have to make decisions based on money to fund public education , 
and they can't get their finger out of their ear long enough to get that major subject in line , 
something's wrong . 
so , i think here in texas mainly that they're not serious , 
they're more serious about what the salary should be for senators than they are for how the level of education should be for children . 
i have a one year old 
so than the true facts , 
that's true . 
i have a real issue with that . 
um , i think that if from every year uh , graders take , 
 and then you see that their education is below the norm throughout of all fifty states . 
they're not saying that something's wrong with the educational system here in texas , 
i have a real concern about that , um , 
as a matter of fact i'm very content to spend my daughter out of state to college in virginia ,
i think there's a big concern 
secretary of education will do something to fix the problem 
but , uh , i don't know , 
they've got to quit worrying about , uh , the , uh , religious , uh , overtones in our textbooks and get on with teaching the product . 
i think they get bogged down in a lot of small issues that you know , special interest groups can blow up ,
teaching these kids , you know ,   really the basics is what it comes down to . 
i was astonished to find out that across the united states in all public schools it is not mandatory for them to take phys ed . 
is that right ? 
what the president's fitness education program is all about , 
they don't have to do situps and pushups and all that crap we had to do when we were going to school . 
i remember . 
and , yeah , 
and , uh , i talked to a thirteen year old last night who uh , goes to , uh , one of the plano high schools or junior highs , i guess , 
and she said that she had a choice , 
she could either have taken tennis , or weight lifting 
so she choice to take weight lifting ,
i mean , the kids sit there 
for lunch 
and talk , 
i have a real problem with the whole system . 
they need to put some sternness back into the teachers and let them be able to , uh , get the old whip out and get some discipline . 
then it comes down to what you said before though about them being some of the lowest paid you know , public service ,
i used to , 
and yet they're so important . 
i mean , i was absolutely flabbergasted at what she was paid . 
she was young , you know , 
but still it's the principle . 
of course , if she got her master's degree it would all be different . 
but , uh , 
well , you know , it's hard though because then you start talking taxes 
oh , taxes lord forbi , 
goodness gracious , if we would , uh , plan our expressways a little better , that ten dollars for the bridges and the roads ,  we'd  cut that in half and get some teachers we might have us a problem .
there's an idea . 
run on that then , no income taxes in texas , huh ? 
that's true . 
i'm in texas too , 
that's funny , 
well , that's about all i have here . 
well me , too , 
 uh , i think we both agree there's some problems there 
i've enjoyed it . 
all right , 
you too . 
bye , bye . 
so , do you have any hobbies ? 
well , right at the present time nothing real special . 
i kind of like gardening 
and i'm kind of into camping and , you know , vacationing , that sort of thing . 
yeah , uh , 
i don't have any real serious , 
i'm an avid gardener , oh , 
oh , okay . 
 i think you're   , 
um , i consider that a hobby . 
i don't know , 
i guess that's a really true hobby , 
but i , 
um , it doesn't really have to matter , 
i mean , it could be working on cars could be your hobby really . 
i kind of enjoy doing that a little bit , too . 
well , i don't know , 
it's not worth getting all mad and fighting and hollering at each other when it goes wrong . 
because it always seems it goes wrong when you try to do something . 
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah , 
that's right , 
you would , 
we'll start them inside 
and , uh , 
my sister tries to set up a greenhouse on her back deck 
 and a wind storm come and knock it down . 
but she's had really good luck . 
i mean , ca , 
next month , 
well , actually , if you start it in a couple weeks and you can get your plants outside , pretty much the end of may , 
you can leave them outside . 
you might put them in the ground just the first week of june 
 but we can put potatoes in the ground in the middle of may . 
in texas and new mexico most of my life , 
but i did once , 
i spent one winter in north dakota , 
and i remember that it was on into may before it really started warming up , 
and , uh  , 
 we live really close to lake champlain , which is in the champlain valley , 
oh , yeah . 
so we're about two weeks ahead of everyone else out on the outskirts 
because that kind of moderates the weather a little bit ? 
we are a little lucky . 
you're at , 
and he gets frost 
you're right across the , uh , lake from , what , plattsburgh ? 
 but , um , 
i had a cousin that was stationed there , plattsburgh for a while . 
he remembers lots of snow .
plattsburgh's kind of a , 
 uh , it's , uh , depressed economically . 
oh , really , oh . 
when you go across the lake , um , 
i don't know why we have so much going for us , 
i really don't . 
i'm , just wrote my resume up because told we might be facing layoff over at digital 
and well , they've had layoffs recently , 
but when we got hired here , no , no , never any layoffs , never , never , 
and now we're looking at serious , 
 i mean , i'm a technician . 
when they start getting rid of technicians , 
well , i'm working for t i , texas instruments , down here . 
well , i interviewed with them . 
oh , yeah ? 
but i didn't want to go to texas . 
even though my , um , mother's people are from georgia . 
we're getting to where ,
stick on the subject . 
well , interesting thing that i do is with , gardening , uh , 
my sister grows flowers that you can dry , 
and you can make uh , dried flower arrangements 
and you can get real handy with the hot glue gun . 
and we made some really nice christmas wreaths with , uh , dried red flowers and dried white flowers and , uh , eucalyptus . 
huh , yeah . 
 you know what eucalyptus is ? 
it's got a s , 
it's got a kind of a peculiar smell to it 
but it is kind of a nice smell after a while . 
people put them in , 
i didn't realize what it was for a while . 
i'd walk into a room where some of that , 
and then one day i realized that it was eucalyptus . 
it's , uh , like a fad thing . 
i don't know . 
i've never heard of it , 
in the last five years i've used so much of it that , 
i hate , 
is that the stuff that koala bears eat in australia or something ? 
maybe that's why they're so slow . 
i guess they're stoned on the stuff or something . 
potent stuff . 
but , uh , yeah , i think it's the greatest stuff in the world , though . 
it's , jeez , 
i make all kinds of things with it . 
we make all kinds of things just with dried flowers . 
i almost want to start a business doing it , 
but i'm so , uh , timid when it comes to starting a business . 
that's a big step , 
it is ,
yeah , uh , 
you know , after a while you make some stuff , 
then you start looking at it , 
go , boy , this is kind of ugly .
but i know someone who does a lot of woodworking for a hobby . 
um , he does it , believe it or not , i wouldn't imagine why , but to get out of the house , away from his wife , 
because he's a seasonal worker , 
he works in the construction . 
and up here it's almost a pattern , 
and you see your fathers do it , 
then their sons do it . 
what they do is they work construction , 
then they get laid off for like twelve weeks in the winter . 
and , uh , this guy was going nuts , 
and his , uh , son built him a garage and got him some , uh , oh , i don't know what the equipment's called , but planers and things 
and he makes ,
and he makes , uh , uh , like little kids' furniture . 
he gets right into it 
and , uh , 
there was a program on t v down here on the educational channel here a while back about a lot of little companies of one and two guys , you know , up there , 
just kind of out in these little towns they'd be in , 
they may be the same kind of people you're talking about . 
you know , they've got twelve weeks to do something , 
and they're making furniture and just , you know , things like that during the winter 
and then they go off and do other things during the summer . 
it's a , 
so , yeah , 
plus it's keeping his marriage  , 
so , plus he's getting on in his years now . 
he's not that old , 
but he's getting to the point where he needed an extra boost ,
and , uh , it's , uh , hard work . 
i couldn't imagine taking raw lumber and trying to make something out of it . 
he d , 
that would be really t , you know , 
like say the , 
oh , man , 
and it's all got to line up . 
and , uh , i don't think he goofs too much , 
i don't see too much scrap around . 
that's something . 
now our temperatures down here , we're starting to get pretty consistently in the seventies and eighties 
 god   , i'm envious .
 some trees out back tonight , 
and , uh , uh , it's really nice ,
is it going to be , 
almost hated to come , you know . 
uh , are you , 
now i always plant trees in the fall . 
i don't know why 
so the cold weather can kill them 
these were , uh , 
 but i guess , 
i don't know where they came from . 
they come out of nurseries mostly in missouri and places like that . 
and they come down here 
and they'll sit in the nurseries here 
and they'll go ahead and , uh , leaf out . 
so what i'm planting or actually transplanting is or trees that are already leafed out . 
oh , that's good . 
i guess they say you can plant them in the spring or the fall ,  all  .
mostly , i think in a place where it's really cold they do it in the fall , 
let them winter 
but , uh , down here , well , it's done both ways . 
what you're planting , 
but , uh 
and , uh , 
my sister does , uh , flower gardens . 
she gets right into it . 
she spends lots of money on them . 
and i guess a lot of people do do that . 
they landscape their whole house with flower gardens . 
 yeah  .
she's got like , just a small patch of lawn and just flowers and  mulch  tree bark all over her lawn .
 the normal kind of flowers , there's very few of them that will really do well . 
everything does real well here in the spring until about , oh , first part of june 
and then the heat sets in . 
it gets , ya , 
and june , july , august are , you know , 
most of are just barely staying alive , let alone make flowers . 
do you have a lot of shade trees around your house 
or is it , 
uh , we're in a relatively new area . 
we're kind of out of , uh , the natural tree area . 
we're kind of up on a higher , 
so you don't have a lot of tree coverage ? 
because going to make , 
this was pasture land , 
but look like jungles , you know . 
they're really , 
see , um , uh , uh , well , my grandmother passed away , but where aunts are they have these huge pecan trees , 
and they just shade everything . 
now where is this ? 
uh , it's in georgia . 
in georgia , 
 yeah , it's right outside of macon , 
and it's just a , 
i like the way that idea of the south is , 
but when i think of texas , i think of nothing but , no trees and just grass .
now , see , east texas , 
there's two parts of texas , east texas and north texas . 
atlanta and dallas are almost identical in every way , weather and everything . 
the two cities are very identical , 
so if you were familiar with atlanta , uh , 
so it's that dry heat ? 
uh , well , no , 
it's humid . 
well , where is it , 
  wasn't  it houston's humid ? 
well , ironically enough i'm sitting here with a cast on my leg because i resumed an aerobics class the night before last . 
oh , no . 
i ripped the ligaments in my right ankle . 
exercise is not supposed to do that to you . 
that's what the nurses kept saying as they laughed all the way , you know , down the hallway . 
do you do anything on a regular basis ? 
well , off and on , 
right now i've been off 
but , i've been going over to the fitness center . 
that's a good , 
three times , 
well i try to go over there at least three times a week , 
and i try to walk , um , at least five times a week . 
do you , when you go to the    , 
i have to ask you , 
and if this is getting to    , 
we're not supposed to get too particular , 
but i'm just curious , 
when you go over there does it bother you in terms of how things are arranged , either at the dallas location or the spring creek , in terms of , it's so much of a weight orientation , weight lifting , et cetera . 
uh , well , i've been going to spring creek . 
i haven't been to the dallas one now in , oh , a couple of years . 
at least since they've redone it , supposedly redone . 
so i don't really , 
 well , it's not that great , 
and i go to the spring creek one on and off . 
but my husband's working over there 
and he just goes to the dallas one . 
but i just don't , 
i mean , it's just so much weight lifting . 
even the spring creek one has a lot of weights in it . 
that's true . 
or is that what your into 
i don't use the free weights 
i like the tread mill and the stair master myself over there . 
i like those too . 
and the pool when it gets warmer . 
that's great . 
i know . 
well , what i did was i went to a jazzercise class in a new location in richardson near where we live in north dallas , 
and long story short , i hadn't , 
this is really a stupid thing that happened , 
but they have like the gymnasium flooring 
and then like they had about three feet of linoleum around the perimeter in the back where i usually stand 
instead of having that level , you know 
and it was about four inches deep and then about , oh a seventy degree angle . 
oh , my goodness . 
and as we were jumping around or doing something i just jumped up and came right down on it . 
the orthopedist called it a , uh , basketball injury where the ankle just rolls under you , and it snapped . 
i know . 
we went to    , well whatever in plano , 
and the emergency room was like a bad comedy show .
and the doctor said , you didn't do anything . 
there's only a one in five hundred chance that the radiologist will call you . 
that was tuesday night , 
and wednesday night the radiologist called me at work 
and , uh , i was on crutches , 
and he said , i think you better call an orthopedist . 
so we went to one 
and he just put a big old cast on it . 
put a big cast on it . 
for about four weeks . 
four weeks , 
well , i like aerobics , 
but i'm not so sure that , 
well not that much , though . 
i've never , 
i was off for about six months too just for some other surgery i'd had , 
but you know , i was pretty much in shape walking 
 and , you know , this is one of those things , 
like this orthopedist said , he said you'd be surprised how many people come in here with things like that because they are active . 
you know , i was real embarrassed , 
but i felt kind of stupid .
well , those things happen , though . 
they do . 
i mean , i guess i'm glad , you know , that , um , nobody really noticed , 
i guess you could say . 
because i got up and started jumping on it again . 
 well that did a lot of good , 
i'm sure . 
i enjoy aerobics , 
and i do it because i like it , 
i mean , i like the music and 
i like the music , 
but i've been unable to do that , because i hurt my foot about five years ago . 
i broke my heel . 
that makes my foot , 
how'd you do that ? 
in aerobics ? 
oh goodness . 
and when i came down i hit with my full weight on my foot , but on concrete . 
what'd they do for that ? 
did they have to cast it ? 
they put a pin in it . 
oh , so the impact , would not be good . 
as i permanently damaged the cushion under my heel 
oh , goodness . 
i can't do any jumping up and down because it makes it hurt . 
oh , that makes sense . 
so , i mean , are you , in terms of other things , can you not do stuff like that at all ? 
uh , well i haven't tried that . 
i don't know . 
i bet it's been thirty years since i played tennis . 
it's been , 
mostly into just walking and stuff like that . 
that's probably the safer way 
because i notice in aerobics a lot of the women that don't look like they shouldn't be doing certain things 
i'm always afraid they're going to fall over and have a coronary . 
and there was my ego when i went ahead 
i mean , like , i'm real tall , 
and , you know , i'm not heavy , 
but when you go easy a hundred seventy at my height , um , i'm five eleven 
um , but when i see some wo , 
i mean , and i just don't think it's healthy 
all that pounding all the time . 
really , it's not really good for your knees . 
so , yeah , 
that's the other reason , 
and , i don't know , 
this was just , i guess , something freak that happened to me , 
because i wasn't familiar with the , 
well , the floor was uneven . 
oh , it was completely , 
i mean , it literally , 
the two dissimilar floor coverings were not level . 
and at first after it happened i thought , maybe that's a handicap access , 
that's just the way it's constructed . 
and my husband being a t i engineer , 
i said a few things to him when i got home , 
but i , 
sounds you , like 
one thing that i like , like swimming , you like that a lot ? 
it makes me feel better . 
that's how i am . 
if i don't do it i just feel like i don't have as much energy . 
and it's real funny because if you , you know , 
it seems like when you exercise and expend the energy that you'd be tired , 
but it's the other way around . 
it curbs the appetite and helps with the calories and all that stuff . 
and i need all the help i can get . 
that gravity factor , 
i know .
it does get you . 
but you're on the upper side . 
thanks a lot . 
i'm not heavy , you know , 
maybe ten to fifteen pounds like any other human being . 
and then , you know , you see these little girls in these little bitty things , 
and they're all like twentyone years of age .
but luckily at   there's a little more diverse clientele . 
that's true , 
they do . 
except for the guys that lift the weights . 
they do intimidate . 
i try to go real late or real early before they get there .
there some things i'd like to try , 
but , you know , sometime when i ask , i just feel like , boy , am i stupid or what . 
well that's one thing i like about the spring creek place . 
at least one of the fellows that's there at night and on weekends is real helpful . 
and his name is b j . 
i think i've , 
there was some girl there . 
i've been there like , maybe a dozen times . 
but i actually like that site better than the other one just because of the type people that go to . 
it's terrible . 
i don't know if the dallas location , 
it just seems that , 
um , sometimes i feel like i'm in a singles bar .
that's true . 
and i haven't noticed that up at spring creek . 
i haven't either , 
and i just , uh , 
it's not that far of a drive 
and i'm glad they did that . 
um , you're not missing anything at the dallas renovated site . 
it's not 
i thought maybe one of these days i'll drive over there and check it out . 
but if you don't live near there that's not worth , 
i live in richardson , 
but it's about half way between the spring creek and the dallas site . 
that's actually where this happened to me , out in , i say plano , 
but it's all the same to me . 
richardson , over on campbell and park hill there's a new recreation center . 
and as we were doing it , too , everybody noticed that there were all these big guys of assorted nationalities . 
   walked out , 
i was one thing , 
oh great , i have purple tights on , you know . 
but in general i like dance a lot , 
so i mean aerobics is something i'd hate to give up . 
but he kind of said something to me about probably not as bad as your foot , 
you probably will for a while , because it's going to be real tender . 
he told me eight to twelve weeks . 
not anything , you know . 
but that's just , 
they tried to put me in some kind of immobilized walker , because he doesn't like to put casts on when it's warm . 
but i just , 
the more they tried to get my foot in the more i screamed , 
i couldn't , you know 
i know what you mean . 
you know more about this stuff than i do , obviously then , 
not fun .
well , you're walking okay now obviously , 
and you can , 
oh , yeah , 
but it matches one if i have one on the other side . 
me too , 
i need to go actually get something to eat here . 
it's great though , 
i really do enjoy it . 
thank you , sandy . 
i don't know , um , 
do you do a lot of camping ? 
 but we bought a van last year , 
and we were hoping , uh , to do some camping in the van , um , 
we did go camping in oklahoma . 
uh , last year we camped in a tent , 
and , uh , there were two other couples with us 
and there was , uh , state park . 
oh , so    , 
and it was really nice . 
um , up here some of the state parks are really nice 
and some of them aren't , 
some of them are pretty rough . 
um , yeah , 
they don't have like a shower room or anything , 
 yeah   , 
but some of them are really nice 
they have showers and full bathrooms , 
um , but i don't know , 
i've been camping a couple times 
but i'm not a real avid camper , uh , 
a lot of people i know are , 
but , um , i don't   .
i don't like really camping in the rough . 
i like the little necessities like having electricity available and running water and showers and things like that . 
  we went once to a  leanto  
and it , um , 
i mean , there wasn't any electricity on the camp site 
but it was all right , 
we only spent two nights there . 
i wouldn't want to spend more than two nights . 
i wouldn't want to go for like a week , 
but , um , 
that would be much . 
um , especially there was a little store close by , 
so , it was pretty nice . 
the campsite that we went to was an area that , 
it's right on a big lake , 
and there's a lot of boating out there , 
and we went up there to hopefully be able to get on the water a little bit 
but uh , it was still , too , cold . 
oh , really ? 
um , yeah , 
up here you got to wait until , august ,  until the water warms up  .
well , it's not that bad 
but it's still pretty chilly . 
um , i don't know , 
i have a tent 
and i  fluff out  in it , in the backyard and stuff , 
but this thing about camping that bothers me is you've got to pack everything 
and another thing is the thing seems to get , 
it's dirty you know , 
so , you can't keep the dirt out of the tent . 
i don't know 
we have a seven year old , 
it's pretty funny , 
 like stay out . 
 we have a dog 
and that's just about as bad as a kid .
 boy , he doesn't go in and out of the tent a hundred times .
they like to play in them . 
i don't know how you can really keep , uh , the inside of a tent clean . 
i don't know  .
other than , you know , taking your shoes off right before you walk in or something to keep the sand and dirt out of it . 
well , what or what he wants to do , 
we had brought his friend along , was play in the tent . 
you can't do that , 
you get the tent all dirty . 
plus you get it all wet , 
we were at a beach site , too . 
um , did you have another , a big tent , looks like a sitting area type , you know , like a two room type    ? 
and , um , up here uh , we have quite a few mosquitoes at nighttime . 
we don't really have a problem with that , um , in these areas , um , 
and even when in oklahoma when we camped i really didn't notice a problem with bugs . 
and i noticed that , 
i know that i said , that's , 
i've lived back east before , um , they , 
 they're  terrible , 
they're really terrible . 
uh , but , there's this one campsite , that it , 
just some of them are known 
but there is one that's out in this big lake 
and its , mosquitoes are terrible 
and then there's this other one  that's  more up in the mountains 
but it surrounds a manmade reservoir 
and there's no bugs , 
that's the whole thing that everyone told me , oh , 
little river state park , 
  that place is great , 
there's no bugs . 
but , oh , 
because , uh , we were having a really big problem up here in certain areas , 
we were really affected  bad by it   , but really got it , um , 
almost destroyed the  tourism  in one town , because of the mosquitoes , 
they're so , bad . 
it's a really nice area , 
i've been there before 
and it's , 
living just sixty miles north of them 
but with mosquitoes . 
and you can go outside in the daytime , all right , 
but um , that's when it's usually , the minute the sun sets the mosquitoes come out . 
i mean , just the very second , 
it's really strange . 
 uh , they must , uh , work on that , you know , 
 it gets cooler when the sun sets 
and then they all come out . 
well , have you ever taken any of those , um , what do they call this ,   lights , 
have you ever used those ? 
oh , yeah , 
but , um , because that wasn't really , 
i bought them ,   
i really didn't get to use them like , oh , there's mosquitoes let's turn them . 
we just sort of lit them . 
and , um , we weren't bothered that much by mosquitoes , 
so , we didn't really contribute it to that . 
but , um , i think in an area that's really thick with mosquitoes , 
i can't see all this little , uh , smoke buckets i call them , 
  they work , 
but they're suppose to work really well . 
oh , i'm in my paperwork here , 
i get in my paperwork . h , to find my most important parts . 
but i don't know if i'm going to go , 
i wish was an avid camper 
and i could really talk about like gardening or something , 
you can talk about that a lot , 
but , um , i do want to go again . 
we just moved into a house , 
so , i don't think camping , 
maybe in the backyard , 
but i don't see going on a camping trip probably until next summer . 
i'd like to go camping crosscountry , um , 
i just got married less than two years ago , 
so , we don't have any children yet , um , 
so , it's easy for you to go . 
so , easy to pick up and go , and , s , 
we have a van 
and we can just throw a couple of sleeping bags in the back of it . 
um , oh , god .
so , it's not really , i guess , camping the way most people picture camping in the tent 
i don't know 
but that sounds that my kind of camping , it really does . 
okay , um , well , um , 
that a nice vehicle where you can have everything in it , plus your tent . 
 or get , 
my brother has a real nice popup . 
and he just tows it behind his truck . 
and he's got three kids , 
so , his kids will sleep in the truck , in the back of the bed . 
um , and they sleep in the popup . 
well , they're kind of nice 
but they're also , um , flimsy when you really look at them . 
but when you get inside they're really nice , you know , 
everything's really , 
but then when you look underneath them , it's just got these little wheels and this   little axle , 
and then a big windstorm it would pick you up . 
he did have a problem , uh , when he went camping last year in beavers bend , oklahoma , um , 
a storm came in 
and it started raining really heavy 
and everybody was trying to flee the campsite , 
 , everybody was getting stuck in the mud . 
oh , jeez , 
and , uh , 
 i mean , like a really violent storm like a tornado , 
just stay in your truck . 
i mean , i wouldn't stay in the , um , 
well , theirs was so bad , 
and they were so close to the water that the water was coming up , 
and they had to get out of there . 
so , then , were they successful ? 
but it took them a little while ? 
but , yeah , 
so , did they get stuck ? 
they ended up helping several other people though that were stuck . 
yeah , huh . 
well , so , they evacuated it .
 the whole campsite was evacuated . 
i mean i think some people that had fairly sturdy , um , vehicles or whatever if they had like a winnebago or something and they were farther in away from the water , i think they stayed . 
but everybody that was real close to the water ended up , 
it was either that or their truck was going to go floating downstream . 
i know i like   to get right on the water , 
by the  campsite , it's so , 
  we have leantos up here . 
i really like them , 
like i say , they're just kind of more  sturdy  than anything , you know , 
they have them right at the campsites ? 
 uh , it's like a little house except the whole face is open , 
and the one time that we went , we got one , 
it was overlooking the water 
but it was a big embankment , 
i wanted to get one right on the water . 
  we had an electrical storm too , 
and it was neat sitting there watching it , 
i mean , it was raining , 
well i have a lot of different teams that i like to keep in touch with , 
of course , texas rangers being one of them , 
i mean , uh , you know , you can't live in dallas without , you know , 
well what are the others ? 
well , uh , i originally came from saint louis , 
so , uh , the saint louis cardinals are one , uh , 
i moved to kansas city , 
see uh , go to a town . 
well it's helpful . 
so , uh , i lived in kansas city for a couple years 
and i adopted the royals , 
i lived in houston for two and a half years 
 so i adopted uh , uh , the houston astros , 
so i mean , you know , i've got quite a few . 
well do you keep up with the statistical stuff ? 
in touch , with maybe , like who's in the top five of hitting , or something like that 
but i don't get into , you know , how many errors somebody has or things like that . 
well that was on   show that i listen to going to work in the morning 
it's essentially trivial statistics 
 but they've got a st , 
it's a statistic that has to do with winning and losing one run games . 
i've heard of that one . 
and apparently the rangers last year , won a lot of one run games . 
well i didn't know that , 
that's supposed to be a real good statistic , uh . 
well , it is 
but it's a reverse indicator . 
well that's true , 
they don't have the offense the more runs , 
well what the argument is 
and it's one of these statistical , 
gee , how can you draw a conclusion from it , 
but they find that , there's a connection between that and how they do in spring training the following year . 
and , uh , strangely enough , it's almost like the law of averages catches you on the following year . 
which means that if you have a good year winning one run games that the following year , you'll have a bad year . 
and um , they've looked at i think twentythree teams , uh , 
 and , the , uh , statistics are something like twentyone out of twentythree . 
it was , 
which means the rangers are going to have a terrible year , 
i , uh , 
well , i mean , and it's , uh , uh , 
i don't know , 
what do you think of incaviglia's loss . 
i kind think it was necessary , 
i mean , a big , um , pure power hitter anyway . 
i mean , i don't like these guys that get up there and swing for the downs every time . 
i mean , uh , i think uh , that a player ought to hit a home run if he's got the pitch to do it , 
but when you get two strikes on you , you know , you should , you know , shorten your swing a little bit , you know , 
if it's a perfect shot , go for it , 
but i mean , you know , the strike outs were a big problem for him , 
 uh , plus supposedly what i heard , he was not much of a team player anyway , 
well how apparently , 
i was reading in the paper tonight that the detroit tigers are going to sign him . 
of , i guess , 
i don't understand the strategy of how baseball works , 
but it seems that , you know , they can sign him tomorrow , 
and he could go in the team the next day , 
 and they put him in the lineup 
and he hits a home run 
and all of a sudden he becomes a hero . 
well that's true . 
and all he has to do is hit the ball , 
i mean , you're not , a , 
and all he has to do is one , you know , hit it once . 
it doesn't , 
he can swing a couple times ,   
if he fouls it up he can swing as much as he can . 
it's of how they do it . 
but i agree with you 
i think that's part of what , uh , baseball needs more of . 
is that when you go , um , you wait and wait and wait 
and finally a guy gets up there and blasts a home run 
and that's all the game is . 
i'd rather see the ball hit around and have the people , 
well there's another point to that too . 
they said with men on base . 
now having somebody get up and hit a solo home run you know , gives you run , obviously . 
but i mean if you can't do it with men on base , there's something definitely wrong , um , you know , 
 uh , in this day and age , 
well how do you think the royals are going to do ? 
i think the royals will do okay . 
they have several pitchers that had badly years last year 
and they're these , uh , cycle pitchers , 
they pitch one year bad , one year good , one beer bad , one year good . 
saberhagen has won , uh , supposedly the cy , 
i think he won cy uh , two out of three years , 
 uh , you know , so he's very much due for a good year . 
well are they going to beat oakland ? 
well now see that's a good question , 
i don't know how oakland's going to react to being , uh , swept in the world series last year . 
they could very easily , uh , take that as a challenge . which is the way most teams you know , naturally do .
well i go to saint louis from time to time 
and i watch their sports up there 
and they're , 
oh yeah , 
baseball is their life up there like football is down here i think . 
did you actually live in saint louis ? 
i lived in the suburbs of saint louis , 
that's true too , .
i think that's all that they have . 
i had a friend from college that lives in , uh , 
  it's well , i should say on the west side , 
i mean everything's on the west side . 
uh , out that way , 
and i went and visited him , 
but anyway , it is interesting . 
well how are the cardinals ? 
oh yeah , 
in fact i've got family that still lives up there . 
um , what i hear from everybody up there , they're not going to have a good year because they let too many people go . 
but i've been following spring training 
and they're like one of the best teams in spring training so far . 
well is that a good indicator ? 
 well it can be . 
 you know , what they were looking for . 
in other words , training they were looking at all their kids , like a lot of them do , um , then it really doesn't give you any indication . 
but if they were , uh , playing the people that they're going to play , then that might be pretty good indication , 
so , you know , training and then gone on a , you know , fourteen game losing streak in the first of the season 
you know what i think is remarkable is , uh , 
it seems that what you really need to do to win though , is to have a team that has reasonable talent and has some people that have real breakthrough years . 
and the question is how do you forecast that , 
you can't . 
if you had to bet on who would be in the world series , i mean it would be really tough . 
that have the talent to do the best years . and , um , that they hadn't had these , uh , gigantic , uh , career years yet and , 
i think they said the reds , um , 
this last year , i'm not sure that they said that they had that many people having career years . 
you know , better this year . 
 well when are the rangers going to come through th , 
uh , that's a good question . 
the rangers have a pitching problem 
and whether or not they can fix that or not is going to be an interesting question . 
they're doing the right thing , though , uh , 
they are going with their farm system . 
they're letting their farm system , uh , build up and stuff like that 
well is there enough money , 
that's part of it , 
i , uh , 
that was part of skip bayless' argument . 
i don't know if you read skip bayless , 
would you agree with that ? 
but i mean , you don't have to spend the big money , as far as i'm concerned uh , to win . 
you just have to spend it if it's necessary . 
in other words if you've got a player on your team who's helping your team , then keep him there . 
don't let him go away . 
and i think that's really what's been hurting , uh , the , uh , rangers . 
well didn't kansas city put up quite a bit of money for their 
oh yeah , 
and they were , you know , toward the bottom of the league . 
uh , so it's like i said spending money doesn't guarantee you , uh , winning a pennant . 
it really doesn't , 
well and that the , um , 
and it , you know , 
if i owned the team . i think you'd like them to do well 
but the question of losing did steinbrenner actually make money on the , 
 you know , i think that there's coming to a point real soon when ticket prices are going to be to the point where the average fan can't go 
and once you do that , you lose everything , 
i mean . 
well yeah , it's a little bit like any other sport , you know . 
when it starts costing you fifty or a hundred dollars to go to a game 
 and , uh , you know , i mean , you're probably going , 
say you go to a rock concert ,
if , you know , i , 
but how often do you do that . 
i would think baseball probably feeds on a number of people that can go out there , you know , several times a , 
that's the whole point . 
there are so many games in a year that they've got to have repeat customers . 
they can't afford not to , 
and , you know , that's one of the things that i think saint louis has done , um , 
i mean , 
i guess as high as anybody else's 
i mean it's a small market 
and yet they attract as many if not more than uh , uh , most , other cities , 
but don't you think there are older fans there . 
i don't mean older , um , you know , 
the fact is more , of a  . . . 
what baseball team are you familiar with ? 
well , i'm only a little bit familiar with the red sox because i lived up in boston for a while , 
um , and that's , 
no texas rangers ? 
i guess they paired two women together on this call for a reason which is something we can think about later 
but , um , i understand a little bit about the texas rangers . 
i know george bush threw out the first pitch hitter    bounced off the ground  
and that , um , 
 yeah   , 
i heard a joke on the radio yesterday in regard that he didn't design the patriot missile system , 
and , uh , the  radio's  kind of cruel , 
i mean , think ,  this chain  that must have been on president bush to bounce the first pitch off the ground , 
i mean , how humiliating for a man to do that , any man . 
i don't care if you're president . 
but at the same time , i don't know , it's pretty far to throw that far .
i couldn't do it . 
i know 
but he's a man 
he's  supposed to be able to do that . 
i know so , 
i felt kind of sorry for him . 
  that must have been hard on him because he's just a person 
but , um , i never    , 
a major owner of the team here . 
oh , really ? 
i didn't know that . 
 like , i thought he was the owner 
but it turns out my mom said that he's part owner 
but he must own the biggest chunk 
because that's all you hear about is , if , you know , about neal bush i think is his name . 
see , i even know his name because he's on the news a lot , 
and i never had to watch the news you know , not like some people  hour and a  half a day or anything . 
and i've been watching , uh , 
my husband's french 
and so if i've been watching the french news ,
 it's incentive   , 
that had a story where he went to visit some little , uh , elementary school students , and stuff . 
oh , i saw that . 
did you see that , where the guy asked him for proof of who he was , 
 he said his    .
i want to see your driver's lic , 
i know 
and  see a  credit card .
you're not president bush . 
i know 
and he said 
it does so fast   , 
i heard it on the radio . 
i heard the audio portion on the radio in the car 
but i didn't see it 
it was so funny to see , 
it was a really cute little kid too . 
that's um , about baseball , 
i don't know ,
well , i can tell you ,
because my brother was supposed to go to the opening game , 
and i couldn't tell you who pitched , 
but they won , 
the mets won . 
did they ? 
but , yeah , 
and then somebody else lost , 
maybe it was the other new york team which is the yankees , 
but i don't even know if they're still new york yankees ,
that's so stupid that you all have two teams . 
that's really stupid . 
then they can have them play against each other . 
i know . 
i think it's still the new york yankees , you know , 
  i thought they were moving to new jersey .
this is how much i know about baseball . 
the texas rangers , they lost , i think . 
but i know that last year 
we did go to a baseball game last year . 
we got free tickets because uh , the places and stuff . 
and he's their head chauffeur , 
is this funny , as they're parking the cars the valet service . 
 right  .
he makes good money too doing that , 
i was shocked , 
but anyway , someone gave an iranian a tip of four rangers tickets last year , 
and then the iranian couldn't , 
he didn't want them , 
so he gave them to alan , 
and alan and his  dad  had plans that night 
so they gave them to us , 
so he decided that some wealthy man tipped this iranian ,
with baseball tickets . 
and we ended up with them , right . 
and so we were ,
 yeah    .
and i looked at my husband 
i bet these are really good seats 
and so we ended up on first base right down there on the floor , 
oh , yeah , 
  they called us at five 
and the game started at seven 
so we just threw everything together , ran over and got the tickets and walked 
 and  so we took two kids with us 
and nobody brings two children in these seats , you know because , 
because they're fancy seats and stuff . 
and you just sit down 
and all the girls were all dressed up   you know , 
i just was there , you know , 
like i'm loaded , 
i'm here , you know , 
and , uh , it was just kind of funny 
you know , but we got to sit by first base 
if  they did hit a  ball i would have been afraid it would have knocked my face in , you know . 
i know i'm always scared of that whenever i go to a game . 
i rarely go 
but we went last year 
because my brother is impossible ,
and if there's a game on , he's watching it . 
i mean , that's all there is to it , 
and he's like glued at the t v . 
i'm glad my husband's not like that . 
oh , i'm glad my husband's not like that either , 
i'd kill him .
my brother's like that 
and , um , see he goes to a lot of games , 
not a real lot , 
but he tries to go , 
then my father got us some tickets , 
so my brother's wife and my husband and i went . 
last year we wanted to show my husband what a baseball game was because ,
and he describes it as , you sit there in a crowd , 
it was nice weather and stuff , 
it wasn't a real problem , 
but you sit there in a crowd , 
and you're waiting and waiting and waiting 
and you eat the hot dogs  , um , 
because we made him try a hot dog , you know    , 
that's funny . 
 um , so you sit there 
and you wait for the longest time really bored , 
and then all of a sudden something happens 
but you happen to look the other way during the time , 
you miss the whole thing . 
and so basically you   sit there and wait for something exciting to happen 
and when it happened he missed it ,
that's funny . 
where is he from in france ? 
 but that   , 
i had a friend in college from strasbourg , 
he's not that far , 
he was sort of in between strasbourg ,
paris . 
and my cousin lives in paris 
and she's lived there like , oh , off and on for twenty years . 
oh , is she still there ? 
 saint claude  is that sound familiar ? 
we used to , 
that's one of the , um , entrances to the  periphery  to get in and out of the city . 
oh , really ? 
and it sits right at the limit , 
i   exactly where she is . 
but , um , we met in paris . 
that's neat . 
she  married  
and they have twelve children . 
oh , my god , the poor woman . 
she looks gorgeous , 
she's gorgeous 
and she just liked having kids 
and she's thin 
and , i mean , 
were any of them twins ? 
you probably can't afford to eat if you have more than  two of them  .
i have a friend now that has seven . 
um , and they're all eight and under ,
they're all real young , 
they're just raised  right  
that's what god's told them to do 
but they're not condemning you , 
if you , 
we only have one child , you know , 
they don't put   on bad or anything which is good because it would be easy , i'm sure , for them to do that , 
you get a  conviction  like that 
and you think everyone should have it . 
and so i'm real proud of them because they don't do that at all . 
you go in their bathroom 
and there's ten tooth brushes in there . 
and i always give her a hard time   whose toothbrush did you really use this morning .
but how do they afford to even have the kids , uh , 
we're expecting our first baby ,
they live  lean  for one thing 
and they tithe 
and they   
we don't honor god with this   portion 
and so they , 
i think that helps a lot . 
i think that's the key , in like his  sales  last year 
he just works a normal job . 
he probably has an income of thirtyfive thousand , 
but last year he made   
that got him a bonus of twentyfive thousand which allowed him to pay cash for a full size van . 
 he loves  god , 
i mean , it was the biggest thing that any one in this company had ever done , 
and he got to do it 
and so god just really blesses him in ways like that , 
do trust god because , i don't know , kids are a blessing 
  you know , we think of blessings as nice furniture and things like that , 
but kids are just as much of a blessing  inside these  material things 
but it's a different kind 
i have an old car . 
but you've got five kids , you know , 
you're just as blessed , probably more , because if you follow this , 
there's a good book called what the bible has to say about child training ,
and he's , you know , 
a lot of wisdom in it . 
and the kids at  bible  talk about anything 
 and training is different than anything else 
in psychology doesn't address it . 
the good stuff that's in psychology it just comes out of the bible 
and they don't quote you the proverb out of it , 
but the things that work in psychology other the years that they've proven to work , they just come out of the bible 
and so this book it just really   all these things and how to train the child 
so they're not going to be a curse to you when they're thirteen . 
 i mean how to train them so they're going to be a blessing 
and so , you know , they do that 
and they just live lean pretty much 
she doesn't shop at foley's you know , and stuff like that . 
but a lot women  die or shop  at foley's 
so  things   , 
i don't know what foley's is .
it's like a macy's ,
it's pretty nice 
and everything's pretty expensive 
and , you know , you just can't do that 
and you don't go to baseball games as much 
or you get pictures like we did . 
you know what i mean ? 
you do these fun things , you know , in other kinds of ways 
and i know manhattan's real expensive 
but   your cousin could have a baseball team with twelve kids .
 well ,   church   softball leagues , 
they're not all boys 
and right now we don't have a girls' league because i'm the one that's supposed to start one 
and i just haven't gotten around to doing it . 
i keep saying we need to have one . 
 but  everybody   wants to do it 
but , you know , god's sitting on my heart 
and i just hadn't gotten around to doing it , 
 so they could really only have four members on the team . 
i think they only have four  boys  .
i don't even think they have but two old enough to play yet . 
they are so good . 
i'm not kidding you 
but she does work with them 
and it's a commitment 
and , that's what they're called to do . 
i have a , 
most of my friends , 
i admire someone that can do that , you know , 
i really can . 
i know , 
i do too , 
most of my friends have three or four kids 
and they feel like , you know , that's  really  why god   
and some of the people in our church use birth control 
and some of them don't , 
i had my tubes tied 
so you , 
um , you know , when they say the middle east ,
and there's so many different problems there . 
uh , what do you want to concentrate on . 
it doesn't matter to me . 
um , i have a sisterinlaw from israel , 
 and they're really quite , uh , arrogant about it all . 
they belong there 
and they've belonged there forever , 
and , the palestinians and the arabs are , uh , more or less , 
they consider them second class . 
 so , they're really quite arrogant about it . 
 uh , i don't know if that contributes to the problem . 
well how did they feel about intervening with patriot missiles , 
did they , 
oh , uh , i'm sure this is the one time that the israelis are really happy to have their big brothers , the americans , 
 but , i didn't really talk about that with her . 
 um , um , my sisterinlaw now lives in , um , switzerland . 
but , um , when they were living in israel , they come in an , 
and they're nothing but really servants for them , 
and they really treat them like second class citizens . 
they don't really want them around 
but they like them around because they do all the menial labor and such . 
but they really do , 
they look down on them . 
and , i don't know , being , 
i live in , uh , vermont 
and being up here we pretty much treat everybody , you know , as someone that has merit , even if they're poor , or if they're hispanic or if they're black . 
we give everybody pretty much the benefit of a doubt because we don't see all the crime and , all the hurt in the big cities , you know . 
if i lived in washington , d c i think i'd have a different attitude about black people 
because i've heard that they're terrible , you know , 
it's just like it's a dog eat dog world . 
and here , you know , all my black friends are professionals 
and you know , they don't go out and abuse drugs 
and they send their kids to school 
and they uh , you know really encourage them to go to college and stuff . 
so it's just a different world . 
well i live in san antonio 
and fifty percent of the population is minority . 
oh , um , i talked to someone about san antonio , 
 and , um , they said that you have quite the problem with , uh , the ghettos , 
i don't know , 
do they call it the barrio down there . 
but i don't think it's any different of a problem than any other major city . 
it's just hispanics here instead of blacks . 
but i heard that it just has a really bad problem . 
i grew up outside of houston 
and uh , as far as gang violence and things , i don't think it's any worse here than in houston . 
 now me not even knowing anything about houston , i would think that it's a pretty calm city . 
houston is not at all . 
there's a lot of crime ? 
oh , my , um , 
like we're so protected up here , 
it's really strange . 
i mean our red light district , i mean , uh , you could go walking around down there and pretty much not fear for your life , you know , 
 and we're just so protected . 
but , like a totalitarian system , when it comes to the palestinians . 
you know , the israelis can do anything they want 
but when it comes to palestinians , if they're out in the street at night , it's really looked on as odd . 
um , usually the , um , jewish neighborhoods , and the jewish cities 
and then at night they're bussed out to the occupied territories . 
so they don't have that . 
but , uh , what do you think about the mess we've created in iraq ? 
i think it's unfortunate , uh , as far as the kurds are concerned , 
i thi , 
it's just what do you do for them , 
you want to do something for them , 
but you don't want to get so directly involved that you're occupying the country . 
we can't get involved in their civil war , um , unfortunately , 
but we've kind of driven these people out . 
but you see president bush is telling them rebel , you know , uh , uprise . 
and that's what they did 
and now they're like asking him for help 
what my husband had very strong feelings , 
he , uh , agreed with , um , the general schwartzkopf , 
he said , um , bush should have let him finish his job . 
he should have let them , um , corner the republican guards , 
well i think the war ended too soon . 
that's what everyone says . 
everyone i talk to , they says , you know , 
it's real easy to say that . 
we didn't damage enough of their arsenal . 
we damaged most of it 
but made sure we got everything . 
i don't think the higher ups were thinking about what this guy's going to do with the rest of his war machine . 
so we're just going to let them go , 
but really we didn't think about the people that he was going , tr , 
and i mean , he's just , 
unfortunately though , the original goal of the mission was to drive them out of kuwait . 
and once that was accomplished it , 
 they stuck right to their goals , 
 and right , 
what they were going to say . 
and the american people , when this first started , they were even reluctant to let them do that . 
so they were playing it very safe , 
but , you know , it , what do they say , an ounce of hind sight is worth , whatever . 
 schwartzkopf knew what had to be done 
and it's too bad that he just didn't have the ability just to do it , uh , the go ahead to do it . 
because he had the fu , 
he knew what was going to happen , more than any of us . 
it was going to make such a mess . 
i mean i feel really sorry for these people , 
these people are middle class people , just like us . 
can you imagine if someone started bombing your neighborhood , 
 and you knew this , 
these people are going to come 
and if you were in your house they were going to take you and beat you . 
of course , you're just going pick everything up that you can carry 
and you're going to run . 
and it's just too bad that we couldn't see that . 
i just have a feeling that the military involvement isn't over yet . that i still feel like there's more to come . 
i don't think this whole issue is settled as far as we're concerned . 
well you know what i was hoping ? 
i was hoping iran was going to take a very , um , dramatic stand and invade , you know , 
and then like iran's the big bad guy , you know , 
but , really , if they were going to save people's lives , 
they've got sixty or so of iraq's planes . 
i know , 
it's like they were using them as friends when we were having the conflict 
but , you know , i almost swear , i'm kind of disappointed with the iranians , 
why they didn't go save , 
i mean , i don't know if the kurdish , 
i know the shiites are their people . 
but , i don't know , 
i think they have a bond with the kurds . 
there are some kurds living in iran . 
i think they should have just done more , uh , 
and maybe if the world could have given them some type of aid . 
it's just so complicated . 
i was real surprised that israel stayed out of it as much as they did . 
oh , yeah , 
well , you , 
knowing them , they're very , um , oh , 
i don't know , 
almost compare them to a very egotistical man . 
you're damn right , 
i'm going to protect my family , you know , 
so , i was amazed too . 
i was really , um , proud of them , though , that they stayed out of it . 
from what i can tell if they had gotten into it , it would have started a whole new war . 
oh   yeah , 
that part scared me . 
that , um , the egyptians would pull out 
and i just saw atomic bomb , 
uh , i have , uh , i guess a lot of thoughts about the vietnam war , um , 
i guess i feel like i was pretty young while it was going on 
and so there's probably a lot of things i remember and a lot of things that i really didn't have a clue as to what was happening . 
um , looking back , like maybe some of the things that i know now , i'm not sure i do believe it was worth the cost in dollars and lives . 
because we never went to war . 
i don't think we were committed to winning it and getting out 
and i , 
and for what was happening . 
you know , i just feel like maybe we went in to be policeman 
and i'm not sure that's our role , 
i agree with that , 
 i was fairly young at the time too , 
i really don't have very many memories about it at all , in fact . 
 and , uh , my husband is a vietnam veteran 
and in looking at the persian gulf war that just went on , he , 
it frustrates him because of the support that they have and the support that the vietnam vets did not have , from the people or the administration , either one . 
 don't you think that maybe that's why we had it this time ? 
i mean i do think that , it's been too long in coming 
but i feel like maybe the american people and the government are aware of the things that we did wrong that we didn't support that  , 
so many people were opposed to the war , 
what it translated into was they were opposed to the folks that were there fighting it 
and those guys were there doing their duty . 
that's right , 
i mean , they weren't there by choice 
and i think that we learned from that 
and i think it's one of those things that you learn the hard way . 
it was a tragic mistake , 
the way that they have been treated over the years i believe that's just now turning around . just now , you know , trying to be rectified 
 and i'm not sure you can undo the damage that was done emotionally ,
i don't think you can 
and in every aspect of it 
and i agree with you also , that i feel like it was not worth the money spent or the lives lost to fight that war . 
i mean they're still not settled over there . 
they're not . 
and i have a feeling that the persian gulf crisis is going to be the same way . 
i think we're going to end up back there in a few years if not sooner . 
well i appreciate the fa , 
i feel like president bush is in a hard spot . 
he went over there to get them out of kuwait , which he did . 
 and then he has backed out , 
he has pulled out . 
so why aren't you helping us ? 
and you see , i think him going in and doing that would be putting us in another vietnam situation . 
i think it would too . 
and i don't think the u s will stand for it . 
i don't think he would do that , 
 uh , i think we learned too much 
i agree with that . 
uh , you know whether it was justified or not , i know , that they probably felt like we were going in for a good cause . 
i feel like maybe they felt like we were doing the right thing to try and help maintain the democracy over there and , 
 but i think somewhere that got lost .
he said that's what we were going there to do 
and he did what he said 
and he did pull out before it got any further than that where , 
 i mean , my biggest problem with all of these wars is we spend all of that money on all these other countries 
and we have so many problems here at home that we don't address . 
that we don't get fixed . 
that's right . 
i know . 
that's what frustrates me more than anything . 
and i believe that we have to have a military 
and i believe that we have to have a defense to keep anybody else from walking in and doing it to us . 
but i also believe that we need to turn so much of that inward . 
i think there's a lot of waste 
and get it lean , and start addressing some of the other issues , 
i think we could take care of everything . and quit taking care of all these other countries all across the world ,
i know , 
i do think that in the middle east war , um , 
i think that maybe a lot of the arab countries that were so hateful towards the united states have come away with , uh , kind of a different attitude . 
uh , i think that maybe we're not their big bad enemy any more . 
 uh , and i think that's good , you know , 
i think that's a good , 
a lot of good has come from this one . 
i think so too . 
and in , uh , ironic way a lot of good came from the vietnam war toward this war 
because like of that war 
and perhaps the reason that good came out of the mid east war is because we had the experience of vietnam . 
so , i do think that , we've learned from it , 
 you know , i wish there weren't war .
no kidding . 
but , uh , i do think we learned . 
and i just hate the emotional price a lot of the vietnam people paid ,
i mean , they still don't know what they were there for . 
there was no feeling of accomplishment , no goal , 
we went in 
but what did we do . 
we lost lives 
and what were we trying to do . 
who knows . 
that's true . 
and , i think you're right , 
uh , i think you're right there . 
um , i do remember when it was over . 
i remember when they were coming home . 
uh , but , i remember the feeling back then , you know , 
 like right now , i feel like this country has been behind this war . 
uh , yeah , 
there's a lot of people that aren't for war . 
i'm not for war , 
but i believe that the way that it was done and the way that was handled were right . 
i don't remember that feeling back in vietnam . 
i just remember , 
oh yeah , 
our guys are over there 
and it's sad 
and we shouldn't be fighting a war 
when this war broke out it frustrated me all the antiwar people and , you know , 
i felt like they got way too much media coverage and publicity 
because who've always got to have a cause , whether it's good , bad of indifferent . 
they've got to have a cause 
you have to support the people that are there . 
that's right . 
and for some reason those people don't see that . 
they don't see it as supporting the folks , the people . 
they don't 
and , you know , they're just real shallow people . 
i would agree with you there .
i agree . 
um , and i recall when president bush said that , you know , 
 you know , i'm sorry that you're opposed to the war . 
there's a lot of us that are opposed to war 
but , uh , you're not helping the people that are over there by what you're doing . 
and i remember a lot of it kind of stopped after that . 
 i mean they're not helping anybody . 
that's the whole point , 
they're not doing anything for anybody except themselves . 
that's true . 
and i don't even know what they're doing for themselves .
giving a soapbox to stand on .
but , well , i'm glad we've learned . 
i'm sorry we had the experience of vietnam . 
 you know , have spent all these years trying to deal with it emotionally , 
because , you know until the past four or five years , nobody ever really worried about that ,
that's true . 
 you know , failed them . 
so , i don't know . 
well , do you have anything else you want to say on this ? 
i know , 
usually i can talk all day 
but this is something to me that's sad .
it is . 
so , well have a good day 
and i appreciate the conversation . 
same here . 
let's hear about your hobbies . 
well , let's see , 
i guess , uh , it's more not so much a hobby but things i enjoy doing . 
i enjoy playing basketball and basically all kinds of sports . 
and , uh , 
any handicrafts ? 
excuse me . 
i'm really not too creative 
well , i , uh , you know , around with my hands and things like that 
i leave that more up to my mom .
so , um , i think i'm   in handicraft . 
oh , yeah . 
i think it will become resume writing . 
oh , well , let's hope that you aren't employed by that craft for too long . 
uh , yeah , 
i hate to think about it 
and i'm getting rather good at reading want ads . 
what kind of time frame is it , uh , looking for the , uh , different shifts up there ? 
i  , 
who knows . 
is it , uh , 
basically , i had read that they're just looking at relocating them all to mckinney is it , texas , 
all means about fifteen to twenty percent ,
 oh , wow . 
i'm sure the number's somewhere classified 
but some of the internal news and the news services , 
so , it's approximately six fifty , 
 so ten percent of six fifty , is sixtyfive 
and twenty percent would be one thirty . 
how about that . 
that's what it did report was a hundred and thirty relocating down to mckinney . 
how about that . 
well , uh , that's unfortunate 
is there many other , 
are you in the defense ? 
oh , yes ,   .
is it , uh , many other corporations in the area ? 
uh , i saw seven eleven that was hiring . 
 well , i'm sure with the new , uh , contract awarding 
 uh , i hear they're hiring all over the place for that . 
yeah , uh , 
apple's coming to town 
 oh , really ? 
uh , and , 
colorado springs specifically , 
how about that . 
if , telemarketing is your bag . 
personally i'd rather die a slow painful death 
uh , i'm a defense worker . 
i'm , government tool control specialist . 
that's why i was in the  deseg  down here in plano also . 
are you still employed ? 
am i still employed by t i , 
actually , december was my first month away from them . 
oh , yes . 
 uh , it was purely by my own choice . 
 uh , there was no incentive for myself to leave , 
but it was just an opportunity arose 
and decided to take it . 
oh , so , you didn't even get the severance package . 
i should have taken the , you know , uh , option when that was there , 
but it was just , i missed it by a couple months . 
but , you know , what can one do . 
i'm just happy still to have a job . 
so , are you happy with what you are doing now ? 
it's getting better all the time , 
i knew it would be different from the very beginning , 
but , you know , as you get to know more of the people that work there and more of what's going on with the system , 
so i was in the computer operations 
 uh , you know , it all starts to become similar 
 you know , there's benefits 
and there's things that weren't as good , 
 but as an overall package ,  i'd say  i'm pretty happy so far with the way it's turned out . 
well , it hasn't been a long time   t i 
or i , 
well , the one thing i guess at least in your favor is the fact that , that is more in the support of the manufacturing 
and there's lots and lots of companies that have maybe not in the defense area but manufacturing in general . 
to tell you the truth , i'm not really worried . 
that's great . 
that's good . 
 and i seem rather happy about it most of the time ,
sometimes it's good just to have everything out on the table . 
but still in all ,
it may be a blessing in disguise . 
i know a number of people who are , uh , surplused 
and they're just , 
actually , what the positions that they found outside of the company were much , much better than the ones that they currently had inside . 
so , despite the fact that i should be tying flies or fly fishing or going for walks in the mountains ,
well , i'm sure it's just with decide on a  pass   , 
uh , situational . 
i doubt i'll be here in six months . 
well , would you like to be there ? 
 but , god this is much better than west texas . 
well , just take the day , 
but then they tell me hell is much better than west texas . 
 well , actually , uh , quite nice . 
my little brother lives in austin right now . 
oh , that's a beautiful place . 
goes to u t . 
that's just fantastic down there . 
take it more as a , 
this is your opportunity to do whatever you want , 
pick out where you want to live , 
and then once you pick that spot out , pick out what you want to do . 
i  , see that's the problem . 
for the last many years i've more or less let them direct what i want to do ,
and now i feel lost . 
that's a , 
oh , i had job offers . 
but , i never found the one that was worth it for me to leave . 
and that , 
well , the best thing about it is that you can , uh , try something 
if you don't like it , shoot , move on to something else . 
that's the way  i would have  looked at the whole thing here , 
i'll take a chance , 
if i don't like it , i'll go someplace else , do something different . 
oh so , had you been with t i long when you changed ? 
five years . 
i've been with them sixteen . 
i can imagine , you know , the longer and longer it goes , 
actually , seventeen now , 
and , oh , yeah , 
momentum is , uh , driving force in our lives . 
 , so , yeah , 
i'm looking as a opportunity . 
well , that's good , 
you've got a good attitude about it . 
and i'm looking at it as a change . 
and i'm looking at it as an adventure . 
there you go . 
that's the way to do it . 
and maybe i'll wet a fly line this year and do some camping if i don't get laid off between now and then . 
there you go , 
that's the thing to do . 
that's much funner than doing any kind of job . 
ha , how about we end this ? 
that will work out just fine . 
nice talking to you . 
all right , 
nice talking to you . 
what's the , uh , 
oh , yes , 
they just , uh , started it again , too just late , or , within the past few years .
you know for quite some time , just about every one of the states had given up the death penalty . 
but now it's coming back into favor . 
uh , yes . 
well , they find it is more deterrent . 
well , my sociology class at s m u's taught us that it was not a deterrent . 
uh , but now that's just what they said . 
uh , i don't know maybe if i went back and took a sociology class now they'd say it is a deterrent . 
well , uh , if you ,
maybe they've changed their minds . 
the , uh , 
because that was back in the seventies . 
oh , yes . they are . 
that was before uh , uh , they adopted the death law again .
but , uh , good law . uh , crimes , murders related with , uh , drugs or killing a policemen . 
i think , 
i agree . 
but i think it ought to be expanded to include children . 
 they're working on , uh , something in austin now , 
 and i'm not sure what it is , 
i just remember seeing a , uh , kind of a synopsis of it . 
well , why stop at children ? 
why not go to adults , too ? 
well , uh , i'm personally very in favor of it . 
uh , why should we let them set in prison and work on their college degrees after they've mowed down a class yard full of kids you know , given their best effort at doing that . 
i don't care to support them . 
well , i don't either 
uh , uh , but there is something to be said about  , 
i'm against it . 
uh , you know yourself how many times have you heard where , uh , uh , a citizen was wrongfully arrested ,
just recently this , uh , black man served nine years was it ,
 and then , 
and she was set free , too , just in two examples in texas recently . 
 but she actually killed the furrier . or someone , 
she was charged with murder 
and then , then they decided it was a case of mistaken identity or something . 
 i didn't retain all those facts very well . 
but i know what you're , 
what if we make a mistake . 
that's it . 
and that's not one of those things that you can turn the wheel back and reverse everything . 
well , right now our laws are so liberal that , uh , even with the death penalty in effect , i don't think that , uh , they're going to use it , uh , too frequently , uh , unfortunately . 
i , like you , say yes 
let's have it ,
why should they be sitting in , uh , prison getting their college degree . 
now that's tougher . 
it's easier to say it on the telephone 
and everyone agree that , yeah , the death penalty's the way to go , 
it's a deterrent to crime , 
they shouldn't catch themselves in that circumstance anyway . 
but to be the actual one of the ones that decide , that would be tougher for me . 
very true . 
uh , i agree with you there . 
i think i'd probably do it 
but we could never say what we would do if we're not in the circumstance . 
that's a real easy thing to say that , oh , sure i would , 
but i don't know .
well , i myself wouldn't want to be on the jury like that . 
uh , uh , to kill somebody is what it amounts to . 
well , yes , 
but , you know , that's what they did . 
very true . 
but they did it because they have a warped mind for some reason . 
or rather than have a warped mind it was just the only way to get whatever they wanted . 
and more than they respect the human life . 
well , anyhow i guess we both agree that , 
hang them . 
i agree it should be in effect . 
also i agree there should be a lot of care in the enforcement , uh , 
so i guess i would say i want it to be in effect 
but i want  , maybe 
well , now i have a problem with this , too . 
i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance . 
oh , that's true . 
well now uh , or , uh , yeah , death verdict is an automatic , uh , appeal . 
that's correct . 
it is , 
it is . 
and , uh , uh , yes , 
i'm inclined to agree with you . 
i think so , 
there should be a limit as to the number of appeals . 
now , there's some , 
and maybe , now , i don't remember if this is texas or not , that has something about all drug dealers can be sentenced to the death sentence . 
convicted drug dealers . 
it , uh , 
what's the ru , 
there are certain circumstances , 
and i don't remember what they are . 
 they're on the distribution end . 
uh , yes . 
they're not selling them , 
they're distributing them . 
it's for the large dealers is what ,
and they are in effect killing people . 
oh , oh , yes , 
i believe it's any capital crime related to drugs . 
oh , okay . 
i think that's the way it's worded . 
is that how it's worded ? 
i knew it was there 
but , i , 
i do believe that's in . 
uh , i wouldn't swear to it myself . 
i believe it is , 
but i thought it was in effect . 
i believe you're right , though . 
i think it is . 
and i have to agree with that . 
i think it certainly should be one of the options . 
uh , i've been fortunate with my children and grandchildren , so far that i know . 
i qualify that heavily , 
 because you never know , 
but to the best of my knowledge we haven't had a major problem yet . 
oh , it does . 
uh , i have four sons myself  , 
and the youngest is twentyeight , 
 so they are all pretty well grown up 
and they all went through it , you know , going through high school and everything 
and knock wood that , uh , they have not , 
well i won't say they didn't try it , uh , 
i wouldn't know , 
but , uh , they , 
i doubt very much that they're using it now . 
in fact i'm sure they don't . 
i think , let's see , the oldest is thirtytwo 
and the youngest is probably twentyseven , twentyeight . 
so , it's the same age bracket . 
and there's four , two girls and two boys . 
and i think one of each experimented very slightly with pot , 
 and i think that was the extent of it to the best of my knowledge . 
that's usually the way it is . 
it's just , uh , try it out with their peers .
and none of them even smoke . 
they don't , uh , 
they never , 
strangely enough , uh , their mother and i both smoked when they were growing up . 
now , my exwife , she quit , uh , well , when she was pregnant with the last one 
and she never started up again . 
and i just quit , oh , about fourteen months and two weeks ago . 
that's tough . 
it is . 
and it seems to be getting tougher as time goes by . 
my husband hasn't quit , yet . 
and he knows he has to 
and he knows he should 
and he knows 
and he knows , 
 but he hasn't . 
i do respect the fact , though , that he refuses to smoke in the same room with me . 
of passive smoking 
and he's concerned about it but ,
if i was in a public restaurant , seated at table with , uh , non smokers i would try to pick my , seat where the smoke would blow away from them . 
or i'd hold the cigarette under the table . 
i've seen all of this , 
the shoe's on the other foot .
uh , i'm aware of other people smoking now . 
well , charles will not smoke in anyone else's house except our own . 
he will get up 
and he'll go outside , you know , 
and he's 
so , when we're invited to people's house , he will not smoke in their house . which i think is good because there's a lot of people that are very , 
particularly if they have children . 
 you know , he tries his best , 
but the actual quitting he hasn't done . 
he changed brands to a brand he doesn't like . 
he put up all of his ash trays . 
he will not smoke in a comfortable position , you know , 
uh , uhhuh . 
it's a ,
they used to leave my cigarettes in the glove compartment . 
oh , how neat . 
and every time i wanted one i have to go outside and just take one . one at a time . 
and , uh , gets to be , uh , a deterrent . 
he has his in the kitchen , 
it seems to me that one of the biggest differences is the computer revolution . 
and , i can very clearly remember ten years ago i was just beginning to explore computerizing my office and trying to find out what kinds of computers might be useful 
and we did end up with , uh , i b m , p c s , which i now would not have chosen  , 
but that was before the macintosh . 
and twenty years ago i was , uh , in graduate school pecking out a dissertation on a manual typewriter .
oh , i know it . 
so i would say that's one of the largest changes at least in my life . 
 uh , increased in use . or probably eight years , 
when i was a freshman in college 
and it seemed like it would , 
they were just getting out with you know , the disks and all that , getting away with the cards ,
 and , uh , 
thirty years ago i had a college job , uh , working as a programmer 
and we had to write code in binary 
and , uh , have it punched in on those little cardboard cards which ,
i know . 
you never see one of those punch cards anymore . 
uh , i think t v has a lot to do with the changes , too . don't you ? in , like , people's attitudes . 
uh , i'm not sure in the last ten years it's been very different from before . 
uh , certainly in the last thirty i would say there have been significant changes . even the change from black and white to color television . 
thirty years ago i guess there were color t v s , 
but i sure didn't have access to one . 
uh , but , twenty years ago , practically everybody had a color t v , 
and now i think they're almost as many , well , 
there are more t v s than households , 
and now everybody , uh , has v c r s and two or three v c r s 
certainly ten years ago , uh , v c r s were just coming on the market 
so that's made a significant difference in the way i watch television for instance , 
because , uh , now i almost never watch a t v program when it's on . 
i know . 
i tape it and then watch it when it's convenient 
and that way i don't have to worry about being interrupted . 
i can just put it on pause .
and you can flip through the commercials 
so you don't have to watch the commercials . 
that's always convenient . 
you can watch a program in fortyfive minutes instead of an hour .
you skip the commercials . 
well , i can't really remember back that far , 
but ten years ago , uh , i don't know . i'd say , like in the nineteen seventies you remember how kids would walk around with a m , what do you call those , little a m radios 
 and now people have jam box with c d players in them , you know . 
that's certainly ,
that's another one , 
car phones is a good point , and , uh , cellular phones of all types and beepers . 
and i had to carry a beeper around 
and they were kind of bulky 
and all they did was just , uh , make a beep noise 
and then you had to go find a telephone and call in to find out what they wanted you for and who you were supposed to call . 
these days they have these tiny little things that are only about the size of two or three pencils 
and they fit in your shirt pocket 
and they have a little display screen that shows you a message and either tells you a person or a phone number to respond to 
those are cool . 
those are pretty neat . 
and they have the kind that just vibrates so you can shut them off ,
and you can still get your messages .
but , let's see , social changes , uh , uh , 
where do you think it's going to go in twenty years ? 
i haven't the slightest idea . 
i was just thinking , though , about a huge social change in the last ten years is aids . 
it was just beginning to be recognized and noticed ten years ago . 
i know that because i was writing a paper about it . 
i was writing a journal article . 
uh , and they still didn't even know what caused it or anything . 
and , uh , there was a suspicion ,
but nobody had identified it 
and they were really just going on epidemiological , uh , 
and then , 
and then i , 
i'm curious what was your , uh , graduate study in ? 
well , i was in english as a matter of fact , and 
oh , wow . 
 uh , but i went to work as an editor and writer , 
so , uh , uh , ten years ago i was working in the medical center , uh , publishing a journal and writing about medical topics .
and , let's see , twenty years ago , i guess we uh 
and , uh , uh , freed people up from worries about , uh , illegitimate pregnancy 
and , i guess in the seventies is the time when that was supposed to have exploded . 
thirty years ago there was no pill . 
you think that's caused a lot of pressure on , like younger kids today ,
i really do . 
i have , uh , 
and i know that the expectation for them was , uh , to have sex and , much earlier ,
in my day , we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be ,
but , they certainly didn't expect everybody to 
and it was really only , uh , acceptable if you were engaged and planning to get married in the relatively near future . 
and i certainly know from talking to my stepdaughter that girls in high school were under a whole lot more pressure nowadays . 
oh , yeah . 
it's kind of scary when i think of what will happen in twenty years , you know , when i have kids and they're grown and  , uh , just kind of some of the changes that will happen even more 
and i guess the answer ,
seems like it can't get much worse . 
i certainly wouldn't have been able to twenty years ago tell you what , uh , my kids were likely to be like . 
course , one of them was just a brand new baby twenty years ago , 
and some of the other ones weren't born . 
so , sounds like america's going to become even more communication society with faxes and cellular phones and 
electronic mail . 
i just got on that this past , about a year ago 
and that's made a difference in the way i do my job because it's so much easier to get hold of people and get quick answers to things .
 it's pretty wild . 
even , you know , 
that reminds me , federal express was around ten years ago , 
but it was used as kind of an extreme emergency 
 and nowadays people use fed ex , all the time . 
sure do . huh . 
people do seem to travel more . 
it's much more common for people , even teenagers to be going to europe and south america and ,
uh , i was almost thirty before i got off this continent . 
and , uh , both my kids had been abroad when they were still in high school .
i know that's uh , what my family was talking when i picked up and moved to texas from indiana 
and , uh , especially come home every couple months . 
you know , and , 
what do you think are some current trends in , uh , the way families spend time together , based on what you've seen . 
um , i think that it's getting to where they're not spending time together . 
um , i think , uh , like in my situation , today , on a weekend when couples are supposed to spend time together , my husband's been off doing his thing all day today , 
and i've been off doing my thing all day 
and i haven't seen him since eight o'clock this morning . 
so , uh . 
are you newly married , 
um , two years . 
same situation here , i've been married about ten months , 
so . yeah , 
i know what you mean . 
hard to find time to spend together when you both work full time and , uh , you both have hobbies that are different . 
you know , if you have hobbies that are the same , then , you know , you can enjoy your hobby together , 
but my husband and i have different hobbies . 
is he a hunter and a fisher and all that . 
that's wild . 
um , so he was off today , uh , looking at records . 
household type things .
and , um , did some shopping and stuff . 
um , from the people i've talked to , i don't know if i should bring this into it , 
but , um , a lot of the dads said that they would probably choose careers um , where they could manage their own schedule 
because they look back 
and , you know , they're all like , um , kind of regretful , i think . 
i think that would be the ideal situation , 
i think that would be the ideal situation . 
i think that a lot of people , 
like in my case i do shift work . 
i don't have that choice . 
same here . 
um , i have to be at work at a certain hour 
and it's not flexible . 
um , it would be nice to be able to have flexible hours 
i might find a job that has flexible hours . 
i hope so anyway . 
um , but i don't know . 
at t i , is that where you work ? 
it's really kind of sad , 
some of the people that i work with their kids go to school during the day 
and then they wouldn't see them at night ,
and so it was kind of like , they see their kids for fifteen minutes and the same with their spouses . 
this relative may work even a weirder shift like weekends , or something , you know . 
so it was really sad , well , you know , have to have dual income . 
a lot of people choose to , which is fine . 
but , uh , you know , then the kids kind of suffer . 
it would be nice to be able to just have , like , back in the old days ,
uhhuh , huh .
the mom stayed home , you know , and raised the kids . 
my mom didn't go back to work until i was in junior high school . 
um , so she was there pretty much all my , you know , formative years . 
and that was nice 
and i liked that 
and i would hope that i would be able to give that to my kids . 
but i think with the way the future is , um , economy wise , 
i don't think it's going to be realistic . 
i know . 
unfortunately , that's probably true . 
um , do you think the parents spend quality time with their kids 
do you think it's more like watching t v and stuff like that , not really , uh  . . . 
i think very few spend quality time . 
i think most of the time the kids are usually off watching cartoons or playing video games or stuff like that . 
i think that , um , uh , they don't really value quality time . 
it's always that way until it's too late . 
until they're older 
and then they look back . 
it's true , um . 
   , i'm not sure . 
i know my parents are growing up , 
i guess they never spent much time watching t v . 
in fact , i've never seen my mom turn on the t v , 
we didn't really have one   .
oh really . 
and  they  spent a lot of time like outside with us and stuff , 
but , you know , my dad had his own business 
and it was easier for them to do that , 
but , i don't know , 
 i guess i didn't realize what a luxury it was at the time . 
i think kids now a days are raised on t v . 
i mean that's almost like a surog , 
that's a good way to put it . 
and not a very good one at that . 
that's a pretty good way to put it .
well if you had kids , what kind of things do you hope to do ? .
um , i hope to , of course , be able to teach them right from wrong . 
i hope to be able to spend , um , their growing up years , being in the home , you know , not having to work .
 who , um , um , 
i work parttime also , 
and i 
a lot of people that i work for are , mothers that stay home . 
um , and they do a lot of volunteer work 
and they're real active in the community 
and , um , they do a lot of things with their kids that they wouldn't ordinarily be able to do if they were working . 
and i'd like to be able to do that . 
i'd like to be able to stay home and be able to spend time with my kids . 
do volunteer work and ,
i agree . 
i hope that happens , in my case . 
but , i think that's for the few and far between . 
i think that , uh , probably ninety percent of the , 
yeah . huh .
and that trend changing much , 
if anything , i think ,
i know . 
and what's sad about that is day cares end up instilling values in your kids .
see i never went to a day care center , 
i never had that kind of experience . 
huh . well i don't even think we had  , 
i don't even remember them being around when we were little . 
that's a big trend , you know , in the last ten years . 
day cares of the kids' lives . 
it's like a home away from home for a lot of them . 
sure , is , um ,  , 
well , .  guess we could ring this off since we've exhausted all of our ideas , 
we seem to agree . 
 yeah i think this is a good closing point . 
well it was really nice talking to you . 
you too , 
i wish you the best . 
you too . 
 uh , bye , 
do you vote regular ? .
every one . 
but , uh , that's just since , in the past say about six years . 
before that i really didn't pay any attention at all . 
well see , that's me . 
i've never paid any attention to voting . 
oh , you haven't ? 
i didn't use to , 
but now i really , 
because i get so angry about what goes on 
and then i feel like i can't really complain too much , unless  , 
unless you have something to do with it . 
but the problem is , that i am very liberal politically 
and so i hardly ever have anybody that wins that i vote for .
oh , liberal , 
what do you mean by liberal , um . 
liberal politically , 
i'm , you know , like pretty left wing democrat , 
well see , i don't know anything about politics . 
oh , you don't ? 
uh , what's the main difference between republicans and democrats ? 
well , there's a lot of them , um , 
it depends on what issue you're talking about . 
but democrats on a lot of issues are more liberal than republicans , 
and well it's kind of hard to say now , especially after desert storm , 
but , um , i think back in the during the vietnam war and stuff ,
and , um , the democrats were the doves , 
they were more for peace . 
and i'm not sure how much that holds true anymore , 
i think , you know , the issues are , 
and you vote for the democrats 
usually . 
and democrats usually are more supportive of public assistance programs , 
and programs to , um , 
the big republican thing is that they vote for less government , 
they want less government involvement ,
and so they're less apt to vote in , you know , more aid to people , 
or uh , they're less apt to vote in programs that involve the government running things . 
huh , okay . 
so have you ever voted at all ? 
you haven't ? 
how old are you ? 
i'm twentysix . 
 oh , gosh . 
i know , i , 
well , i don't know that much about it . 
i don't keep up on it 
and i don't feel like i you know , 
so that's what they need , well , 
if they could make it oh , easier to find out , you know , what's going on . 
do you know what i mean ? 
 i didn't know what would have been wrong with , 
i can't even remember who ran for president against bush . 
i think it was , uh , that woman , 
wasn't it a woman . 
dukakis . 
didn't he have a woman , 
 or was that reagan . 
there was a woman that was running for vice president for a while . 
oh yeah , 
that was , 
ferraro . 
that was a while ago , 
that was a couple elections ago , 
that's okay . 
well , that's what i mean , 
like i didn't know what the difference between dukakis and bush was . 
you know , i didn't know anything about bush or dukakis . 
 so uh , what do you think about what you see on t v about them , like in the news or on the ads , 
do you kind of just , 
i don't remember anything about dukakis , 
you don't ? 
but , well they're all saying that they're going to do , you know , whatever is best for their campaign anyway . 
that's what i mean , 
if they had some kind of public programs where you can just go out and , 
i don't know , 
like you know , in school they didn't teach you about uh , the government , 
you didn't get any government classes ? 
it's really hard too , 
because before they used to have , um , a lot of , 
it seems like the stuff that they put out now , it , i mean , doesn't just seem like it , 
i know for a fact that any kind of stuff that if you , wrote and asked for material , 
well what do you believe in , 
what do you believe in , 
they don't take any stands on anything . 
or they word it so that it's really hard to tell where they're standing on certain issues . 
well i'm not sure they're , 
i know how they do it . 
like with the abortion issues and stuff . 
they have to kind of take a stand on some things , like abortion and things like that , 
 so that's kind of , how i judge . 
there's a few things where they have to say yes or no , like abortion or gun control , 
or let me see , 
i try to look at if some of the newspaper articles , or the , 
i don't trust t v as much , 
but newspaper articles can show how they voted in the past 
it all depends again on who's writing it and who they're for , because they can slant that too . 
and like i said most of the politicians , i'm    , 
also the politicians put out what makes them look good anyway . 
and everybody's got , you know , stuff they don't want known . 
everybody's got a secret .
 well anyway , i'm sorry 
i didn't have much knowledge . 
well that's okay . 
do you think , 
i don't even remember this being on there . 
i mean , what would it take , 
like , god , this is really good actually , for to talk to somebody who hasn't voted , 
i mean , what kind of , 
that you would know more about it . 
now i'm sure they've got it at the library ,
i mean if i get to the library . 
i've got two babies , so , i don't , 
oh do you ? 
that will tie you down a little bit . 
but i don't know . 
 or do you feel like it's not really going to make that much difference if you don't vote 
oh , i know if enough people think like that it , you know , would make a difference ,
um , well a lot of people , they'll vote the way their family votes , you know , 
i mean , 
well , not in my family .
we're really independent . 
all split . 
but a lot of families do that . 
i know a lot of wives feel like they have to vote the way that their husbands vote . 
and that kind of keeps from getting a lot of issues resolved .
i lie . huh . 
but well , 
i don't know , 
if i did understand politics i probably would vote more , 
but like i said if i voted for bush , 
or like when , uh , gary 
not that i think he was good looking , 
and then , i didn't think that was right , because he may have been a good president , or whatever . 
because it , 
he had an affair , 
and it just threw him out of the whole running . 
and a lot of people go by their , uh , personal life when they vote 
which i guess if you got turmoil in your personal life , you're going to let it come into work 
i think everybody does , 
it just depends on how well you can hide it . 
you know , and i , 
that's very true , 
i think that doesn't really have that much to do with , um , unless they've done something really horrible , you know , 
well , criminal or something like that's different , 
but otherwise . 
i mean , what effect does that have on him running for president . 
do you know what i mean ? 
it's all so secretive , 
see we really don't see the , 
that's right . 
i think the people that want to get elected are turning it into a popularity contest by advertising the things that , 
but see they're trying to find an excuse not to deal with you know , the issues that people really want to know about , because on those issues you have to say yes or no . 
and if they don't say yes or no , then maybe somebody will vote for them that wouldn't have if they had come down on the wrong side . 
do you know what i'm saying ? 
so they just try and make it a personal thing , 
i mean , if you remember any of the t v commercials from the last presidential campaign , they all had , uh , pictures of bush walking around with his grandchildren 
and even from reagan , it looks like a mcdonald's commercial , you know . 
 that's about what it looked like . 
 well what did you think of reagan as a president ? 
i just thought he was really inept . 
i don't think he did anything at all . 
they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet 
and the people that were , 
do you think he won from carter because of um , the hostages that were held at that time ? 
 well i think that was part of it , 
i think there's a lot of the recession and stuff , 
people just had a picture of carter as not being real capable , 
but he , actually , 
all right , 
i thought he was great . 
i thought carter was good too , 
and that was , 
did you ? 
i always liked him , 
i thought he was great at the time 
and i just couldn't get over the fact that reagan beat him . 
 you know , that i just couldn't believe that he got voted out . 
 but , i think i wasn't , 
well let's see , 
so i was only fifteen or sixteen , 
but i remember carter 
and i liked him . 
you did ? 
have you heard stuff about him lately , 
do you know what he's doing ? 
well he is really active still politically . 
he's been overseas . 
you remember when he was in office he did a lot of stuff for the middle east , for pe , 
 well , what are your , 
do you use credit cards ? 
i usually , uh , 
the ones we use is like visa 
and we always try to pay it back at the end of the month . 
 i have , uh , uh ,  .
so it doesn't  get   , uh , uh , the credit , uh , 
the interest rate is so high that you're really , 
otherwise , you end up paying so much more for your merchandise that it's hardly , 
that's right . 
do you have a lot of credit cards ? 
i use them mostly for big things , like maybe , sometimes , uh , tuition you know , if i'm short , to go ahead and get it and then try to get it saved back as quick as i can . 
the other thing , i think if you do get overextended a little bit , you need to be sure and pay it off , uh , more than one at a time , because i think you could run forever paying what they require . 
oh , yeah . 
just goes on and on . 
which is what they want . 
but really , i mean , if they don't have the money then , they aren't going to have it in a month , 
that's true . 
they , uh , make the mistake of ,
there are times , 
sometimes when you , 
the money will be available , 
but it's , you know , not immediately handy . 
i think , uh , they're very helpful , plus the fact that it's helpful not to have to carry a lot of money sometimes . 
but , uh , you really do need to be very , um , oh , responsible about it 
or you end up in deep trouble . 
i made that mistake when i first got a job 
and that's kind of like , 
it took me quite a while to pay them off , 
so after that i decided , well , i'm not going to use them at all , and just try to pay cash for everything 
and that worked for a while 
and then we got married 
so we decided you know , if we used them we would pay them off as we go . 
that can be very handy under those kind of circumstances . 
the other thing about them is too , and haven't developed a credit thing . it stops you from doing a lot of things . 
if you , 
that's true , 
of our monetary system  ,
but , uh , it's true , 
you have to be very careful or you end up , uh , going in the deep end 
uh , and an awful lot of people are in trouble . 
we have a boy living with us who works for a credit card , uh , company that , 
and he makes calls to people who have problems , you know , credit problems ,
and , uh ,  ,
so it's , 
so that it's a real advantage to you , instead of a disadvantage . 
i think , um , the way the tax system was , they encouraged people to use credit cards , you know , with a big write off at the end of the year . 
but now , it's punch money , because 
you cannot , 
you cannot write off your interest . 
even before it probably wasn't , though , because you didn't get anywhere near as much as what it , 
so , well , i'm not , 
other than that , i don't have too much on credit cards 
it's good to talk to you . 
you , too . 
thanks for calling . 
bye now .
do you exercise regularly . 
what do you do ? 
uh , i ride a bicycle quite a bit and uh , work out with free weights .
i love to ride a bicycle . 
i live right near white rock lake , 
so i try to ride , about ten to twenty miles a day . 
but , i 
oh , that's good . 
last year i went an was exercising on a bike for a while 
and when i'd gotten back i had gotten some sun that day , 
the sweat had built up on me and built up under my skin and caused me to peel . 
it was the sweating , not the burn 
oh that's  weird  .
that was wild .
but , i don't exercise now , 
i just had a baby three months ago , 
i haven't really gotten back into exercising . 
oh , yeah . 
but i exercised real good for a couple of years . 
it was aerobics and lifting weights three nights a week 
and it was running three nights a week . 
so what's your motivation ? 
a friend of mine , always pushing me . 
this was in louisiana . 
and she would push , you know , 
let's go do it , 
and you know , she wouldn't take no for an answer .
oh , i just wanted to look good , 
i was think , 
it wasn't really health related . 
it was just a side benefit . 
because    , i'm not big or anything , 
but i'm not in great shape , 
but when i worked out , i got in pretty good shape . 
i didn't build up muscle , though , 
i just got real good and toned . 
i don't think women look good with muscles . 
yeah . 
it's just some of those women that come up there looking like arnold schwarzenegger's sister just doesn't get it . 
so what was the other question , 
let's see , do you do it as a task 
or do you enjoy working out . 
i guess it's a task 'cause i can't make myself do it lately . 
i think uh , i enjoy it sometimes 
and there's other times when i just get tired of it 
so i should keep up . 
you don't want to lose yourself . 
and there's some days to get started . 
well how old are you ? 
i'm , uh , twentyseven . 
so you're still young . 
still young , getting older . 
we all are , 
but , uh , 
it's not hard to stay , 
well if you keep working out when you're young though , when you get older , you know , your body's not going to look as bad . 
i seen an old woman today , 
she was about eighty 
and she looked so good , 
i mean she was standing just as straight and tall 
and she had a small waist 
and she didn't have , you know , like , 
you know , how some older women will get the big bulge right in the middle . 
she didn't have that at all . 
her lips were a little bit wide , 
but a lot of , 
back in her time , they liked women with big hips anyway 
 so she may be keeping that on purpose , 
i notice uh , if you stay in shape you don't age as bad , 
i think , too . 
i go to school , too , at night 
and last semester i had stopped working out 'cause i hurt myself and started smoking a lot , 
and you just , 
those kind of things age you more . 
well smoking ages you quick , 
it puts those little wrinkles around your lips . 
an you can't , 
and then , you know , it just kind of feeds itself . 
you smoke , 
and then you don't work out because you , 
you get winded . 
and so , 
oh , i smoke a pack a day 
i finally quit because , like all i was doing was going down hill fast . 
i can't quit smoking , 
i've tried . 
i was telling a friend of mine that i'd be almost as bad as being an alcoholic , 
i can't quit smoking . 
i've tried , 
i just can't do it . 
i quit when i was pregnant with my kids , 
but , you know , as soon as i had them , right back to it . 
yeah . 
it was like , you know , 
that was the only reason i quit . 
i didn't want to . 
oh that's , 
and i don't want to quit smoking , 
i enjoy that . 
i'll keep this one thank you .
but , uh , did you ever go to like one of those health clubs or anything ? 
and now i work out at home , because my schedule with school and work , i don't have time to get down to one . 
there used to be one that was a twentyfour hour that i used to go to 
but , uh , i actually prefer to work out alone . 
i like to work out with people , 
i need , 
like you , 
i need competition , is what i need . 
i've got to have somebody to compete with , 
or i don't want to do anything . 
i wouldn't mind and stuff 
but when you get into some of health clubs where you just stand around and wait . 
are you , 
you know , i like to start , get it done and get out of there . 
are you married or anything ? 
well , get your girlfriend to work out with you . 
a lot of women like that . 
i'd love it if my husband would ask me to work out with him . 
he doesn't work out very often . 
course , he don't need to . 
he's small 
and he works as a laborer on the railroad . 
so , you know , he's building his muscles up all day , 
he doesn't have to do anything . 
he can eat like a horse , too . 
and you know , he don't gain it like i do . 
but , uh , 
uh , especially having a kid , i guess , tends to just gain weight because you have to , to , 
you have to . 
well you can gain too much weight . 
i gained a little bit too much , 
but i looked , 
with my first little boy , i did gain a lot of weight , 
i got about fifty pounds overweight with him 
and i didn't loose it until two years ago 
and then i got pregnant and , you know , ruined that , 
just have to start all over . 
well , actually , like i say , it ain't as bad this time , because i was in shape when i got pregnant . 
i wasn't overweight when i got pregnant with him , 
i just wasn't in shape . 
i don't know the difference 
some people are a little bit fanatical about it . 
you know , i , 
about weight ? 
well yeah , 
i like to work out to look good and stay in shape 
and , you know , i know it's good for me , 
but people that live for it and , you know , eat a bunch of different pills , and ,
well that's what my friend did . 
well , she was with the wheat germ and all the vitamins and everything else 
and really , we was , you know , 
even with her taking all those expensive vitamins and stuff ,
now there , 
you can take those , uh , 
what is it ? 
i couldn't think , 
there's really bad for you . 
i was trying to say hemorrhoids ,  , 
i was trying to say hormones . 
hormones . 
uh , steroids . 
but , i stay from that crap . 
it's too dangerous . 
oh , i could just see hair start growing out of my upper lip or something . 
i had a friend whose brother did steroids 
and as soon as he stopped working out he just ballooned out . 
it all turned to fat 
and he just ,
but , uh , 
i didn't know it did that . 
i don't know if it does to everybody , 
he was , 
just that's how it affected him . 
and he , i don't know , just , 
but i've been wanting to get me or a bike . 
i've been wanting to get a ten speed to ride around . 
i'm scared to run , for dogs . 
course i know dogs can get you on a bike too , 
at least you got a chance to out run them that way . 
i don't like to run myself . 
i've thought about it several times 
and i like to move a little faster and cover more ground . 
well they , 
they've come up that running is not as good for you as they thought it was . 
your legs and your joints and stuff . 
it's real hard on your legs 
and it's hard on women . 
and it just makes stuff move down . 
 i like jogging , 
i don't mind that . 
i can get out and do that ,
uh , i can't . 
if it's hot , you can't do that . 
but oh , i love to run in the rain , 
just , you know , be careful not to slide . 
it's dangerous . 
you slide . 
at least maybe some of these mountain bikes you could 
but a regular ten speed with those skinny tires ,
oh , uh , i don't know what i was trying to do . 
i was trying to make a u turn 
and i never could make a u turn in a bike , 
i can do it in my car , 
but i tried to do it on that ten speed and wrecked 
and i told her a dog was chasing me .
but i wrecked it into the curb . 
i didn't hurt it too bad . 
i scratched it on the oh , 
she had some kind of fender thing going over the back tire , i think . 
but oh well . 
anyway , it's been nice talking to you . 
and , uh , 
well good luck with the new kid . 
she's good . 
anyway , have fun exercising . 
all right . 
all right , 
do you have a bunch of factories and stuff out there ? 
what we're more concerned with is the inner pollution in the city . 
the , uh , 
um , we've actually had some warnings in , uh , raleigh 
oh , you mean 
and we have a belt line around raleigh where we're trying to divert traffic . 
and , um , you know , it's just surrounding the city , 
and you can actually see it . 
there's a couple of , uh , tall buildings 
and you can actually , you know , 
they're blurred , 
they're even dark , 
and what it is is the pollution . 
what do you think of uh , the greenhouse effect that's going on ? 
well i guess that's the fluorocarbons 
and , uh , 
that's causing the hole in the ozone . 
that's very serious . 
i mean , we're even feeling the effects of the weather from , uh , uh , the shift in the jet stream . 
oh yeah . 
i mean , uh , the last two , uh , years , our winters have been absolutely nothing . 
i mean , maybe , one snow . 
well , all right , 
north carolina . 
uh , north carolina is all the way on the east coast . 
it's further west than georgia , 
it's , uh , right below virginia . 
well , kentucky's next to virginia , i'm pretty sure . 
well , i'm from kentucky , 
i should know 
i'm sorry . 
but kentucky , we use to have i mean , just real cold , cold winters 
 and we'd have three and four feet of snow . 
course here in texas they don't have snow , 
they don't know what snow is . 
they freak out when there's snow on the ground .
originally i'm from texas 
so , i mean amarillo . 
so , uh , 
well that's close to here . 
real close . 
how long have you been in raleigh ? 
um , i've been out of texas about ten years . 
well , how old are you ? 
oh , twenty , uh , seven . 
i almost forgot my age . 
well , we're the same age . 
oh , really ? 
so that's okay . 
i think it's just something that goes with the territory . 
but to me , texas , see and kentucky , we had to have ice on the ground for them to close school . 
in texas , i'm serious , if it gets cold and it looks like it's going to rain , i swear they close everything down . 
i just laugh . 
i mean , i do , 
they get , i mean , 
and traffic slows down to nothing . 
actually , they've been doing the same thing here . 
 you know , it's kind of funny , 
 um , i guess northerners are different , 
but even , uh , north carolinians , they don't know how to handle cold weather . 
oh , well , no northe , 
i'm from the north , 
that's why i said in kentucky , we , 
i don't know , 
you just get used to the weather , 
and of course the people down in south , they're not used to cold weather and stuff , 
and , uh , 
i don't know , 
i just laugh 
every time they have snow ,
and you know , you can have snow on the ground and not be slick on the road .
that's true . 
but , uh , 
do you all have much pollution there ? 
i mean , not to see it . 
now of course , you know , t i is here , oscar mayer 
 and there is a few factories , 
but i don't see much pollution going on . 
well , you know , what irks me is these cars that are driving down the road , 
and you have that black smoke coming from their tail pipe . 
well , see , they have um , what is it a   test , or something like that they call it . 
and , uh , 
supposedly that's supposed to catch it . 
and even these buses , oh lord , it real bad . these buses in raleigh , 
school buses and the 
oh , yeah . 
i mean , school buses are notorious . 
well , they're burning that diesel fuel is what it is . 
oh , yeah , 
and , uh , it gets bad . 
well , you know what they've started doing is instead of the tail pipes being at the bottom of those buses 
and that way it gets above , um , other cars on the road 
well , that's a good idea . 
 and , uh , it really does make a difference , although it settles , you know , 
even if it's at the top and it's a lot of black smoke coming out , it still settles , 
that's even more miserable . 
i'd have to go out to the country to jog . 
well , uh , the , you know , pregnant women aren't supposed to walk along a highway 
i didn't know that . 
when i was pregnant with my first little boy , i had read it , 
because i was walking back and forth , toc , 
well not back and forth , 
i was walking home from , uh , the college i was going to 
and i was having to walk along the highway . 
it was just one day a week . 
but it was , in , 
i have no sense of smell , 
so i couldn't smell this , 
but it would make me sick , 
and i'd be real tired anyway 
golly , that's bad . 
all the exhaust . uh , 
well , that was four years ago , too , 
it's probably a lot worse now . 
oh , i'm sure . 
well , um , you can really feel it , you know , in your breathing , even normal people , 
and if you're older , um , i mean , you can really deplete your oxygen , 
and it'll , you know , pass out , 
and you know , it's killed several people . 
do you , uh , smoke ? 
it's kind of l , 
it was kind of funny . 
they were doing some , uh , ozone testing , the e p a 
and they were just screening some candidates , 
and i don't think i'd ever , you know , do that , 
but they , uh , asked me if i was a smoker , 
and i didn't fit into the smoker's category , 
and i didn't fit into the nonsmoker's category . um , 
 you know , i was just one of those 
because you do smoke one a day . 
in between people . 
so that kind of threw them off . 
um . uh , 
but they're doing a lot of research here , uh , the e p a 
for the air pollution . 
they're real big into it . 
they've got research triangle park here , 
and uh , lot of stuff . 
but , they , 
i don't hear much about it down here . 
course , texas , we don't have a bunch of pollution . 
but , too , we've got that air coming in off the coast . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and you know it'd blow it up north . 
so , maybe that's part of the reason it's not so bad down here . 
but , no 
oh , gosh , i think i would hate to live in california , the smog there . 
i mean , i can't believe they have warnings here , which it's mainly just when it gets real , real hot . 
but they usually have that everywhere because of the humidity especially . 
well that's kind of good to know , 
because lord , i thought i lived in a halfway decent area . 
i think they do that for most everybody . 
the old people 
well you ought to come to north carolina . 
it's a big change .
it is ? 
there was no trees where i was from , in amarillo , 
and here they've got the mountains , the beach , the trees , you know , 
it's really pretty here . 
oh , well , this is pretty wooded area down here 
is it ? 
in a lot of parts , 
i know texas is supposed to be flat , 
but you know , down by the denison dam 
sherman and denison , 
do you know my grandparents live in durant ? 
they do ? 
they live close then . 
real close . 
i go there , 
in durant , oklahoma ? 
you go where ? uh , 
you go to visit them ? 
oh , uhhuh . 
we used to go fishing in lake texoma . 
well , down by lake texoma there's a bunch of wooded area . 
 but kentucky's beautiful . 
they've got trees , 
and trees are supposed to , you know , purify . 
you know what the best indoor purifying plant is for smoke and stuff ? 
it's a philodendron . 
oh , really ? 
it's supposed to filter the air for you , in your home . 
well , i'm going to have to get some . 
i had one . 
my husband bought it for me when my daughter was born four months ago . 
do you smoke ? 
do you ? 
did you smoke when you were pregnant ? 
i couldn't make myself quit . 
i did cut down a lot .
i mean i can understand that , actually . 
i've got one vice 
and smoking is it . 
i don't drink , 
and i try not to cuss , 
and i do very little , 
and smoking , i got in the habit of it when i was about thirteen . 
well , one thing i miss are , you know , 
i miss their morals , their values and everything . 
it's , uh , 
uh , i wasn't saved until i got down here , 
and people down here are just , 
there's so many christians , 
and it's so different from kentucky 
um , i worked at t i for a while , 
but then my brotherinlaw works there , 
and he got me into it . 
oh , i see . 
how'd you get into it ? 
um , um , and actually doing some research , 
well , it's fun , 
i like talking to new people . 
and well a couple of times i've been interrupted by my little girl , 
i've had to hang up and stuff . 
but i enjoy it . 
i talked to people from , well , what , carolina now 
boston , massachusetts .
but i've talked to people in new york , 
but i've talked to a lot of people in texas , 
i guess , it's because t i s down here . 
i've talked to a lot of people in texas . 
i had one call actually from charlotte , north carolina , and virginia , and , um , 
i can't remember where all . 
from up north , like you said , 
i think one was from boston . 
with boston , i love their accent .
i do , 
i love the boston accent . 
i met a girl from boston one time . 
my husband was in the service , 
so we went from kentucky to louisiana 
and his family's 
we're out of the service now . 
oh , i bet you're glad . 
he went to panama 
oh , gosh . 
and , uh , he  . . . 
well , uh , it seems to me uh , that 
i do not know whether the jury system , uh , 
i should not say i do not know . 
i do not feel very , uh , stronger that the jury system should be changed . 
it seems to have worked , uh , time immemorial . 
and when , uh , difficult decisions , uh , are made , uh , uh , uh , they generally prove out to be right by things that occur later on . 
uh , i know in some cases now in some states , depending on the criminal code , uh , a unanimous verdict is not required . 
and indeed some juries are no longer twelve people , 
they are down to uh , and misdemeanor trials . 
uh , i think that the judges should be left to do most of the sentencing , simply because , uh , uh , there is , 
on the other hand , uh , the prison crowding problems and things like that ,
but , i mean , is not that , 
and other , uh , 
i think that is what is happening . 
i think , uh , the judges are trying to save the people from having to ,
you know , that might be it . 
i mean , they , 
i do not , 
but in florida now , uh , uh , uh , someone was just sentenced to eighteen years , i heard it on today , uh , without any specific recommendation for , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , uh , waving the normal , uh , procedures . 
and the eighteen years will , uh , translate into something like , uh , four point seven , if the prisoner is a model prisoner , 
and indeed the present overcrowding conditions , uh , prevail . 
plus , i guess , there was some credit for time this guy had already spent in jail waiting for trial . 
so , uh , yeah , 
you might be right about that . 
i do not know , 
it just seems to me that cases come for trial anyway . 
and , uh , only about , uh , four or five percent of , uh , 
in the very end 
or with , 
with a conviction ? 
oh , okay . 
that most of it is plea bargained , uh , half way through 
or most of the cases are plea bargained anyway . 
but , uh , uh , how do you feel uh , about the jury system itself ? 
do you think that should be changed ? 
or if they have smaller juries 
uh , i do not know exactly what the size of the juries . 
i know one of my friends was , uh , uh , brought up for jury duty . 
and he only heard very , you know , piddly type cases . 
most of it was , uh , robberies or things like that , you know , 
it was not any serious crimes . 
so apparently even for the smallest crimes , they give the person you know , any felony anyways . 
well , i guess we , 
they give the person the option for a jury . 
i guess we always focus on criminal trials with the jury . 
but i know you have a right to ask for a jury in , 
takes a heck of a long time , i guess , to get there 
i do not know , uh , 
i should imagine virginia , from what i read , uh , uh , is like every other state . 
it is faced with , uh , uh , enormous costs to maintain the jury system and the prison system and the entire trial system . 
because i guess ,
not that they won't appoint them 
but there is no budget for them , i guess . 
so it seems , uh , 
i do not think i would change it . 
the more i verbalize it , i do not think i would want to change the system . 
i do not 
uh , i do not think i would either . 
i know , 
it , uh , does seem like the , 
i cannot think of the word i am looking for . 
anyway , the deterrent .
people have , 
i do not know , 
they just do not care any more . 
the benefit , i guess , of crime outweighs what the deterrent is . 
uh , and yet 
you know , people that , 
i mean the prison population , uh , as far as i , uh , you know , 
my impression of it is that it has doubled in the last ten years and tripled in the last twenty . 
i mean it , 
 i guess our population has grown some too . 
but one of the worst things that could ever happen , uh , from what i read and see and understand . 
i mean i do no think i could handle prison . 
i mean it would be 
well , i would be interested in 
well , there must be a ,
and , uh , 
the jury system itself , uh , comes in to play there . 
i would think that , 
one of the things that sort of bothers me is the ability , 
of course the interviewing of jurors after the trial . 
i mean that when a jury makes a decision , they should not be asked , uh , before television cameras and newspaper reporters how they reached that decision . 
i mean , i do not , 
i imagine there is a certain right of the press to have the ability to ask that . 
but from any sort of an inquisition after .
well , i know , uh , 
on the other hand though , when , uh , after the barry trial ,
oh , yeah . 
i was there during the trial actually , 
and the opposite was true of me . 
we want to see , 
i do not know what they wanted honestly .
i mean , just because you feel like he was being kicked on , which he certainly was , you know . 
no doubt in my mind the federal government picked him out and selected him to be 
oh , i felt that way . 
i felt , 
the guy was obviously 
i always balanced in the situation . 
i remember the jurors , uh , 
i think they only , uh , found him 
one count . 
but i do not know , 
maybe when you are there in the courtroom yourself and you are sitting there and you have got to make a judgment on somebody . 
and the prosecutors do a lousy job , 
or maybe the evidence was not as sensational as the media presented it . 
i mean , i , 
that might be it . 
well , yeah . 
i think we are getting , 
i think i am getting a call coming in . 
oh . kay . 
all right , nice 
well , it has been nice 
thank you . 
what you mean , my voice ? 
oh , no 
i am from kentucky .
oh , well . 
well , the topic today was gardening ,
i know , 
we are about to hit it in few minutes . 
i figured i could make this call and get it over with . 
we are going to mow and trim and 
and that is all we have been doing all weekend . 
you know what ? 
it seems like we are doing it here forever . 
we bought a large house that was completely unlandscaped . 
i mean , 
that was all that was there . 
and we hired a professional landscaper to do it . 
and i have since then probably ripped out half of what he has done because it has always been incorrectly planted 
or the plants do not make the winter time . 
and so i am kind of at this point getting a little bit broke and deciding that what we are going to do is we are just going to struggle through the rest of this year ,
uh , how many kids do you have ? 
just two , 
but they are just eighteen months apart so it seems like a lot more . 
i mean , how old are they ? 
four and five . 
four and five . 
i have got uh , a four year old and a four month old . and an eight year old stepdaughter . 
oh , well , i have a twenty six year old stepson , 
and i do not know if that counts . 
well , you do not have to tend to him . 
well , i did for many years . 
oh , you did . 
it is over with . 
he is gone . 
it is over with . 
uh , back to gardening . 
if i can just nuke it , i would do it . 
but i do not . 
i just , 
it is like , oh , i will get out there and pull my weeds . 
i do not have a real big front yard . 
but i do have half of it is a flower bed ,
because the porch is pretty big , 
i live in town . 
but just pulling all the weeds out of that just drives me nuts . 
i do not like it . 
and i just went out this weekend and bought me some plants and stuff . 
and i just plowed through the whole nine yards . 
got up everything . 
there was some plants that are just spring bloomers 
 and i , 
 when the blooms died , the leaves were just horrible looking . 
so i just broke all them off . 
it was a hyacinth . 
have you ever seen those ? 
oh , yeah . 
oh , they are .
but the leaves , i do not like them . 
you know , once , 
all right , 
now are you sure they are hyacinths ? 
because that is a bulb . 
well you should of just ripped the whole thing out . 
because i like the plant in the spring . 
i love those pink flowers . 
they are just pretty . 
so i just cut the leaves off and transplant and put some other plants down . because i want them to come back up next year . 
have you had , 
is this the first year they have been up ? 
well , let me tell you , they do not come back very well at all . 
maybe they will up further north . 
but down , 
and you are not that much further north . 
i have probably planted  , oh , around here , um , maybe six hundred bulbs . 
of hyacinths ? 
oh , of everything . 
but i have just learned from doing hyacinths that if you really like them what you do is you dig the bulbs up and then you throw them away after they are done blooming . because they do not take the heat here . 
and if they do come back next year , they are going to look real puny . 
oh , they will ? 
about the only bulb that repeats well in my area is the , uh , uh , daffodil and some of the narcissus bulb . 
now i have got some daffodils . 
and , everybody down here calls these flags . uh , the irises i guess , uh , 
they call them flags ? 
that is what they call them down here . 
they get , uh , just one bloom on the plant . 
i am not sure what they are called . 
when does it , 
but i do not much , 
well , i think they are stopped blooming now , in the spring . 
and what color ? 
oh , they come in all different colors . 
the blooms are , on some of them is yellow , purple , white . just all different colors . 
and you only get one of them ? 
well , i mean , per bulb . 
you get one big flower that looks like a lily . 
i do not know what they are called . 
i have always called them , 
well , i do not know what i have called them .
but when i come down here , everybody told me they are flags . 
you know what i bet you they are ? 
and i am a pretty good gardener 
because i have killed a lot of things here 
and i have planted a lot of them . 
and i work on a , uh , landscape committee for our neighborhood . 
and our neighborhood is a planned development with , i think , it is seven hundred and fiftyfive families . 
but we have about sixty acres that we have to plant . 
it is some type of lily . 
and i will get , uh , 
is it , 
what color is yours blooming ? 
i have got some in the backyard that bloomed blue . which i it will fade into a solid purple . 
and what does the foliage look like ? 
does it fit that , 
green spiky leaves . 
now it looks almost like a hyacinth only a lot higher . 
and it 
oh , oh . 
dutch irises . 
on the flower , does it have a beard on it at all ? any kind of fuzzies ? 
you know , i really do not know . 
that has got to be blooming this time of year . 
it has , 
they're died down . i am sorry , they are dead now . 
well , i was 
they bloom in the spring . 
because they would have bloomed pretty early . 
they bloomed in the spring . 
right about after the daffodils ? 
i took and just mowed over them last year . 
and , uh , we have been , 
i do not much care for them . 
after the bloom dies , they are not pretty . 
but i took them out of my front yard , 
and i just threw them on the side , intending to transplant them or throw them away or something .
well , i went out there this spring , 
and they had took root right where they were , on top of each other . 
and they told me that they are the hardest things you know , 
but they are real easy to grow . 
does that help ? .
well then it is not a dutch iris then . 
i am not sure what it is . 
they said that they are irises . 
it is some type of iris though . 
but they call them flags down here . 
well , i am not so sure that texans know what they have got . 
i do not know what it is . 
i am just getting into gardening this year . 
did you just move down here ? 
we moved in this house , may of last year . 
so it was really too late to do much . 
um . who . 
because i do not know how many square feet it is , a big circular driveway . 
the whole , uh , perimeter bordering the house is all in texas wildflower beds . 
 and it looks quite formal . 
i mean it really does , 
it looks 
well , that is , 
but it has been about three or four years of , uh , uh , playing around with flowers to decide which ones actually grow here . 
well , what kind of blue ? 
i am wanting bl , 
you want blue ? 
and blue looks so pretty 
ooh , blue is hard , you know . 
do you want a perennial flower that will bloom all summer ? 
i bought , 
well , i would like to have one that would bloom next year too . 
that will come back up . 
put in a perennial blue salvia . 
now um , the plant itself will grow about eighteen inches tall . 
and it will send out a flower spike . 
you will see them blooming now . 
it is a wildflower here , 
but you can get them in the nursery . 
i am looking for a pen . 
i want to write this down because , 
well , that is where i went this year . 
because i waited too late to really plant stuff . 
but i did not know that these hyacinths , 
like i said , i do not know anything about plants . 
i did not know the hyacinths were going to die . 
well , the , you know , will sell you things here . 
and they are kind of in a labor of love . 
the other thing to do if you , really like the hyacinths , and i do , is that before you plant those bulbs , stick them in the refrigerator for five weeks or so to cool them . 
that is what i did with my plants . 
i had bought these , uh , 
and they will not grow down here . 
salvia . 
and now that will bloom all summer long 
but it insists on full sun . 
buds , planted , 
and it looks pretty good out there . 
i will tell you another plant that is purply .
kind of a purply blue red . 
it is really a pretty plant . 
it is sold down here as purple buddy . 
now , it's not , 
it is an annual . 
but it will take the heat down here . 
purple buddy . 
its proper name is gomphrena . 
how do you spell that ? 
g o m p h r e n a . 
and they make , uh , oh , about a foot high plant . 
and they send out this spike that has this purple ball on the top of it . 
but that purple ball , 
well , wayne , i , uh , feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children , and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available . 
how do you feel about it ? 
well , yeah , 
i feel much the same way . 
i've , uh , two kids right now 
one is two and a half 
and one's nine months , 
and , uh , that age , of course , everything you do they're trying to learn to do , 
and so , uh , it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn , you know , that they need to learn at the age , you know 
we went through this with our children , and now with our grandchildren , 
and i've always tried to do things with them , uh , like , when you're at the little league , helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself , 
i was able to help the coach in just controlling the kids , if nothing else , 
and we've always , uh , oh tried to take our children and now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to . 
i think that's just part of their overall educational process , is to get out and see and do things . 
and so , it's uh , 
we have , uh , lived several places around the u s 
and where we've lived , we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area , 
like when we lived in tennessee , and things like that when they were small . 
so , uh , that's the type , 
it certainly does , because , uh , you know , the things in the books seem so dead to the kids , you know , unless they've actually been there or whatever , 
because i remember our family , well , we went everywhere . 
and , uh , seeing new england and , uh , being on plymouth rock and stuff like that was 
and we could , uh , read the things in the history books and understand what they said , when it was like , we need to raise food quickly 
we've , uh , 
i remember my parents didn't do all those type things , 
and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that . 
and even now with my grandchildren , i feel it's a very important thing to be done . 
because if , uh , kids don't look up to you , can't feel they can spend time with you , they're going to find someone else 
 and uh , you know , nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid emulating or whatever . 
well , i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is , uh , when my son was , 
i think it was in the sixth grade , 
they had to write a little brief autobiography of themselves , and about what they had done and what they wanted to do , 
and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to , uh , have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him . 
a real point of pride with me . 
that is nice . 
excuse me , it sounds like we both have colds . 
 um , well , it's , uh , ten o'clock here in falls church , virginia . 
so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold .
oh , well , we're 
talk to a guy on the phone . 
well , i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of dallas , texas . 
so , we're kind of far apart here . 
i'm an electrical engineer by trade 
likewise , uh , we do some projects every now and then . 
we like to get support from , uh , other companies as well . 
i'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan .
so , trying to work myself out of a job .
but , it's been an interesting , uh , roughly , oh , nine months here , 
and , uh 
we've lived here about seventeen years , 
and it's , uh , 
we enjoy living here . 
it's where we originally started out , 
and we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee . 
so , wound up back about two hundred miles away from where we started out . 
well , uh , that's about all i can think to talk about right now . 
it's been a pleasure talking with you . 
thank you . 
so , uh , you live in dallas ? 
now i understand that , um , the real estate market out there has really gone crazy , up and down , up and down . 
i don't live in a house , 
i live in an apartment .
are you in a house ? 
we have a single family home in northern virginia just outside of washington . 
well , i guess the best i can do is , uh , compare apartments .
 if it can  compare the one that i have now ,
uh , this one , you know , gave us free cable and , uh , ceiling fans 
and , uh , it was practically new when i moved in here 
and the carpet was new 
do you live in the highrise ? 
it's just a two story building . 
uh , but there are a lot of buildings 
but it's just two stories . 
uh , on the second floor they don't have a patio 
but they have a sunroom instead of the patio . 
on the first floor , um , where i am , there's a patio . 
oh , okay . 
 you have one floor all to yourself ? 
oh , okay . 
the rooms are nice and large 
and , let's see , i have two bedrooms . 
and , uh ,    , 
oh , that's nice . 
do you get your own washer , dryer ? 
well , i have a washer and dryer area 
and i did buy the washer and dryer , 
but they didn't provide it . 
the one that i moved from didn't have a place to put them , 
and that's one of the reasons that i did move . 
that is nice . 
get tired of dragging clothes to the laundromat .
so , tell me ab , 
i've always , uh , been pretty lucky . 
the real estate out here's been pretty good . 
 well , the prices came down last year . 
we had sort of like a dallas syndrome .
the past , uh , uh , year and a half prices have gone down which is totally new for northern virginia . 
 it just   , 
it just never happened before . 
so it's really surprising everybody . 
all the developers don't know what to do .
it's a good time to buy ,
uh , we actually have our house on the market because we have two kids 
 and we have a three bedroom house . 
and it's pretty much filled up right now . 
oh , so you want a bigger one . 
get an extra bedroom or a basement . 
right now it's just a single level rambler . 
one thing about the houses uh , in dallas , they don't , uh , utilize basements the way they did in new york . 
my parents in new york had , uh , a , uh , three family house . 
actual   a , 
two family house where um , the downstairs and the second floor they had , 
and then they rented the third floor with the whole apartment , you know . 
and , uh , they had a basement , 
and you know , they finished the basement , 
and they were able to rent that out also . 
but , uh , in dallas i just haven't seen basements in houses . 
and i've looked at a lot of them ,  you know  .
a friend of mine was thinking about coming down there , 
and that's what he said was that , you know , it just wasn't something that people had down there . 
it's a , 
they put pools and garages on ,
i have yet to see a basement in a house . 
and , uh , 
maybe it's all the sand . 
is there a lot of sand in , 
i always think it's like a desert , 
i don't know . 
   dallas always , 
well , no . 
you know , i don't see that kind of sand here . um , 
there are some areas though where they have a problem with , uh , the houses kind of sinking a little bit 
or the foundation is sinking or something . you know , just a little bit , some more than others . 
but you have to know the right spot ,
and ,  uh   , 
well , out here you know , natural grasslands . 
and , uh , they , 
it's just , you go down four inches 
and well , fourteen inches you get to sandstone . 
and so any place where they put a basement in they had to blast .
i see . 
it's just solid sandstone . 
where did you say you're at , colorado ? 
virginia , 
 that's right  .
it's sort of unusual really . 
most of virginia is clay . 
anywhere near , uh , virginia beach ? 
oh , yeah , 
uh , my folks used to live there . 
back before i was born ,
well , different areas in dallas have different kind , 
 uh , in texas i'll say 
because down in east texas there's a lot of red clay . 
and , uh , in the dallas , you know , fort worth city areas you don't see that . 
well , uh , texas is a big state 
so i imagine the type of houses and , uh , things like that are truly different from area to area .
but , uh , that's the same way out here 
because , um , well , we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington 
 and anything instead the highway , the real estate's forty thousand dollars more expensive . 
so , you know , i could never afford a house inside the beltway . 
that's why we came out here . 
this is called the country , you know , with only , you know , maybe twenty miles total from d c , twentyfive 
but , um , it's considered the country since it's , uh , you know , that far out . 
well    , 
but , um , yeah , 
we live out by dulles airport . 
i see . 
and , uh , that's one of the few places still in northern virginia 
they have trailer parks that are down around the corner from here 
and , you know , it's still pretty rural . 
uh , not too much of northern virginia is like that anymore . 
land has gotten so expensive 
they just can't afford to have low income housing like that . 
so , is your house in an area by itself ? 
i mean , 
it's not connected to another one ? 
there's , uh , 
oh , no . 
you have to , uh ,  stay in one  single family home . 
i sort of got spoiled with that when i was growing up . 
uh , my folks , um , had an apartment for a while when we were kids 
but , um , for the most part they always had , you know , 
and pennsylvania always had a single family home 
and so , 
and that's all i ever knew growing up , 
so . i stayed in a townhouse for , uh , two years and then , uh , saved up enough money to get a , 
hi , um , 
this is betty 
and i'm in richardson , texas . 
i'm nola 
and i'm in plano . 
oh , okay , 
well here we go .
i guess we're going to have a lot of parades this weekend in honor of these guys that did some stuff over in the gulf . um . 
yeah , uh , 
oh , okay . 
i just , 
but , i think it's , 
we're just sort of getting acquainted here . 
oh , okay . 
um , you know , i just wanted to see if , you know , you had an opinion about this , 
or , you know . 
that will be fine . 
well , hi , .
good morning . um , 
the middle eastern situation is that they're a totally different type of people than we are , 
and i mean they think differently 
and their idea of what is justice is totally different from ours . 
i think that that's been proven in the fact that , um , they have just , 
well , anyway , i just think that , you know , the united states policy over there , 
i think we should just leave them alone . 
i really do . um , that whole region over there , i think needs to settle its own differences within itself . 
and that's the course that they should go , 
i mean , you know , we can maybe help them a little bit , prompt them , 
but i don't think this intervention at such high levels should be going on . 
the thing with israel and palestine , i believe that should be settled between them . 
and also , um , you know , the other thing is idea of democracy has nothing to do with them . 
i mean , i'm talking about the whole middle ea , 
and maybe this is too general , 
but i just believe that , um , they do not look at democracy the same way we do . 
they don't understand it as we don't understand the way they live . 
and , so , you know , trying to put like a square peg in a round hole is just , you know , 
i don't think that that's the way to go in this 
and , um , you know , that's a couple thoughts on it . 
i guess , you know , i'd like you to maybe express something here . 
i think it's kind of sad though , that , for generations they've been taught to hate each other . 
and i , you know , 
somewhere in there someone's going to have to learn a different way . 
you know , i think that , um , 
true we do have completely different ways of looking at a lot of things , 
but , uh , at the same time , i think there is a lot of good that the united states and other countries can do , as far as example 
and , uh ,  , i think some different things could come from what's happened , than what we expect . 
well , ye , 
well , yeah , 
um , i guess we could be a catalyst for their change . 
i , um , 
the war has certainly sort of set things on end over there 
and i don't think we'd be talking about this , you know , the palestinian situation , um , sort of came to a head , um , unless there had been a war . 
i mean that was one thing ,
i don't judge any war as good or bad , 
it's just a war . 
and i don't see any winners or losers , 
i just see dead bodies . 
i'm sorry . you know , 
but , um , i just think , you know , you're right 
and i think maybe it's at a whole different level of them trying to cooperate and get along . 
it's not going to be that we're going to , uh , you know , sort of , tell them to go to their room 
and that's going to solve the whole problem . 
it's going to be them , 
but , that's the type of thing they understand . 
they don't understand any other way . 
and , you know , 
and so at that , you have to work at their level ,
that's true too , 
i , um . 
they wouldn't have understood anything than what we did in the war . 
oh , well yeah , 
 they understand violence . 
there was nothing else . 
they love violent leaders , to , you know , 
i mean look at , you know , the leader they had . 
they just adored him ,
and , you know , for a while there he had them , be , 
i can't figure out why they adored him . 
well it has a lot to do with their religion . 
i got to say ,
and i know this only because from personal experience that i'm speaking of this , 
because i've , you know , traveled around town with different cab drivers in a situation where i've done that 
and one of the kindest people i've ever met in my whole life , um , is from that area of the country 
and i mean he is abounding in kindness , let's say . 
and his wife is so godly , i mean , every thought , 
they have a totally different life than we have . 
you know , and when you add the , um , commercialization of the western world it sort of screws everything up for them . 
and they have very basic life , um , 
and they just really believe in allah , or god , or whatever . 
and you know , everything is to the glory of allah , 
it's almost like , 
what's sad is that the leaders that have control 
well that's ,
and they abuse that . 
and it's always been military 
and it's always been , 
which i think that that's not the way the majority of the people over there really are . 
so it's really hard , when you see the leaders , compared to the people . 
 but that there are a lot of people that don't follow what those few are doing . 
you know , there's , 
and the , uh , soldiers leaving , um , you know , surrendering and ,
that was , 
and , the , you know , 
it just really comes down to people are people , you know , 
you have to have some compassion some humanness . 
that's right . 
doesn't matter where the boundaries are . um , you know , 
there are political boundaries 
and those are man made boundaries , 
but , you know , for heaven sakes , that's something that's been going on for ages , 
and i think so much of it is what you're taught . 
that's true . 
you know , they teach their children , uh , in such a way that , 
well , hi . 
i guess , uh , i'll just start by saying that we entertain with , uh , a gourmet club here . um , which means that we have like eight people , four couples . 
and most of the husbands , 
this is really peculiar , 
most of the husbands cook . 
i mean , the wives during the day , you know , get , i guess , so burned out on cooking whatever they have to cook every day . 
um , you know they don't really care about gourmet stuff , 
but it was the guys that got together and did all this . 
oh , that's nice . 
and , um , like my husband just , he really , really likes to cook in terms of , um , oh , barbecue , 
and i mean all guys , i think , like to barbecue . 
i think it's caveman , 
but , um , he really does cook 
and it's a good thing because , you know , you can't knock that . 
but all these other guys do too , 
and so we've gotten together 
and we just do these really elaborate gourmet meals . 
and it's really , really kind of a neat thing to do . 
how often do you meet ? 
well , we try , 
i mean , because you know everybody is so active with their kids and all that . 
it's like , you know , if we can do it once every six months , we're doing well .
oh , yes , 
so , i mean we originally started out , you know , when we were younger 
then we tried to do it every other month , 
but lately it's just been once every six months .
well , that's much more reasonable . 
i was involved in you know , where we tried to really do gourmet , uh , meals . 
and , uh , we were a little bit too frequent i think . 
i don't remember if we were once a month 
or anyway it was difficult . 
by the time we went around it was , uh , four couples 
so , uh , by the time we got around , uh , to each of us and it was time again , we were almost tired , you know . 
it's too rich . 
oh , it is absolutely . 
and , so , we found that while we enjoyed the evening we regretted it the next day . 
um , so , uh , we kind of , 
and then one of the couples , uh , moved 
and so we sort of didn't continue it , 
you don't have as much time for , uh , regular entertaining , 
but , um , uh , uh , good for everybody 
and that's , 
oh , yeah . 
well , yeah , 
that's true . 
and we have a gourmet friend that can't stand fish 
so i mean he can get within , 
oh , yeah , 
well , one of my friends doesn't eat any cheese at all . 
oh , my . 
uh , so that's a real problem because so many dishes require cheese . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , well , i take that back . 
uh , she can't eat some cream cheese . 
but that really limits , 
it sure d , 
it makes you , uh , keep looking for recipes every time you have an eye out ,
oh , yeah . 
right . 
so we try to keep all that in mind , 
but otherwise , um , i guess , you know , entertaining , um , 
i guess i have recipes 
i , um , 
but that's basically what we do is the gourmet , 
so , you know , they would be pretty elaborate . 
um , but it's fun . 
i mean it took us four days to cook a stock and three days to make this stuff , 
oh , wow . 
but you're right . 
it's very , very rich 
and i'm glad we don't have it every , 
because quite a treat 
it really is . 
sounds wonderful . 
but so , you like food 
and i just love the community of food . 
i just ,
oh , sure i do too . 
i just love sharing meals and , 
i don't think you have to be , you know , more than hamburgers and hot dogs out ,
well , my , um , daughter is graduating , uh , sunday 
and so we're having ,
and i did a cop out on to it 
i'm buying cold cuts .
well , i have to ,
 what are you providing   ? 
and i have to make hors d'oeuvres 
and i have to make dessert 
there you go . 
uh , so , oh , i'm buying the little tiny rolls and so on . 
but i can't do it , you know , working fulltime 
and , it's just too much . 
i know . 
we're all not built like , uh , what , oh , 
those people that try to do everything . 
we all aren't martha stewart and have our coordinated glasses and tablecloths and , 
shot a video of the whole thing , 
 i don't know  .
but it's really kind of a neat thing . 
i get a kick out of it . 
i really do . 
everything , all parts of the food , 
i mean 
and you know people really pretty much appreciate it . 
oh , they do . 
it's very difficult to purchase , um , items that are as good as what you can make yourself . 
oh , i think so . 
um , in spite of , uh , 
or if you do buy it , it's extremely expensive . 
in fact , uh , i just got back from a shopping trip to purchase the cold cuts 
and an amish market near here . 
and i've never been there before .
and the foods are wonderful . 
and one of and so on . 
and it's like thirteen fifty for a whole strawberry cheesecake . um , which is really not such a bad price . 
i decided i just couldn't quite make myself , um , buy it because i do make cheesecake 
and somehow 
there you go . 
but i was very tempted because it looked wonderful , 
and they had black forest cherry cake and all those things . 
 but those are homemade . 
they are not , um , commercial bakery made . 
and in that they are made in their homes , um , 
so it's kind of interesting , uh , 
it's out there if you want to pay the price 
oh , it is . 
i mean , we have bakeries around here that , you know , you just gain weight going by the door ,
just smelling the air .
but i don't know 
i guess some of the best things i've ever had , um , some of them were just hors d'oeuvres , you know . 
doing little hors d'oeuvre things that , i have a kick making that , i mean , you know .
i get off on strange little details of food , i guess . 
this is the southwest , 
this is ,
you know you can always make it hotter ,
so . that's , um , a really good party time ,
 and they just love it , you know , down here . 
it just 
 we like hot food too , 
all the stuff that goes with that , 
you don't sound like you're from texas originally though . 
thank you for noticing .
i'm from chicago . 
i thought , 
and how i got , 
and how ,
i'll bet . 
 um , do you have a favorite hors d'oeuvre recipe that's easy 
or is it always complicat , 
in fact , it just came to mind , um , 
and this , 
what was one of the latest ones that you've seen , actually ? 
oh , i think we rented pretty woman 
the last two years , i have done more theater movie going than i have actually watched videos at home . 
i've , uh , 
i'll just go at the matinee hour 
and i can see what i please ." 
it's no more costly than renting one . 
the last , 
see i went about two or three weeks ago and saw f x two 
and that is a really good movie , if you like special effects , 
kind of gory and lots of , you know 
i have not done that one , 
i don't know if i have even heard of that one . 
um , do you know that i don't follow performers , 
i don't follow actors . 
some i know , 
some i don't . 
uh , and he was 
he was not the star , but the one that played in it that i liked best was the one who was in , uh , oh , the one about the old people . 
cocoon ? 
he was a blond haired , heavyset alien in cocoon . 
oh , okay . 
i don't know what his name is . 
uh , i think i know who you are talking about though . 
at any rate , i also saw not long ago once around . 
that was with richard dreyfuss . 
and , that one was just a very poignant story , 
it had people , 
 you know , a lot of people said it was a really funny movie , 
but it was ,
and it was like , uh , uh , steel magnolias . 
the characters played very well off one another . 
and there was humor involved , 
but the story was a very dramatic story , 
and i enjoyed it very much . 
what are some others that you have seen lately ? 
oh , i'm trying to think , uh , 
just the other night on h b o we watched the hunt for red october ,
 oh , whoa , 
and that's one that , 
i was going to read while it was on , 
but then when it started , i just couldn't , you know , read . 
that was a really good movie . 
it sure was . 
and , you know , the second time you see it , you understand more subtleties in it . 
there are a number of good movies like that . 
there's quite a few , uh , movies out now that i would like to go see . 
my husband ,
 and i guess , more than anything , that is why we don't go . 
plus , by the time you get a babysitter , and then pay to go to the movies 
you don't work ? 
well , you are going to have to find a mother's day out and have him call in sick one day . 
go during the day , 
that's right . 
there's nothing wrong with that . 
go in the early hours , 
it's a matinee , 
it's not crowded 
and the price is as reasonable as renting a video . 
and that's the way i do it 
and i go quite frequently . 
if you are going to be planning on doing that , 
now i was warlock too , which is supposed to be the story of a , uh , witch hunt that is , you know , magically shot into the present time . 
and , the first five minutes or ten minutes of the movie i was very well persuaded to walk out . very well persuaded , 
there was more gore than i was interested in seeing . 
but , as the movie settles down to a comfortable action , uh , i can't really that it would have gotten more than a star and a half from me either . 
and , of course , i enjoyed those good guy , bad guy type conflicts things . 
so , i enjoyed that movie , after the first few minutes of gore . 
and there were some others , 
but they were done a little more tastefully . 
but , uh , in the first scene , the warlock chopped off a guy's finger because he wanted the ring and then 
and i could not handle that . 
then , uh , i saw awakening , 
that's a wonderful , wonderful job by robin williams and peter de niro . 
uh , i , uh , 
robert de niro ? 
i think you said peter . 
i said robert de niro . 
and , he has done a really good job of characterizing the , uh , disabled person . 
and , of course , robin williams always just has an air about him that you can't help but enjoy what he is doing . 
even when he's sad , you know , you great faith that he will get happy again . 
and then , oh , let's see , there's a couple or three that i would like to go see before they go into videos . 
i guess , i can wait another month 
and they will be videos . 
one is silence of the lambs . 
i've heard a lot about that one . 
they say if uh , you really want some suspense , that's the one to see . 
and , i understand that's a sequel to an earlier movie that showed about two weeks ago on television . uh . 
well , you know , i think i read about that too . 
and then thelma and louise , 
i think it's time we had a lady abuse the guys movie . 
it's about time for one of those . 
i want to go see that . 
and i'm going to try to get in dances with wolves . 
oh , you haven't , 
i've heard that is wonderful . 
i've heard it's wonderful too , 
but it's just that they are both very long 
and the matinee starts before i can get away from work . 
and , after that i get involved in other things and don't want to 
i've heard that's , 
 uh , we , uh , rented the other one , 
i was trying to think of the other one that we had rented lately , uh , was presumed innocent , with , uh , harrison ford , 
i guess he's in there . 
and , i thought that was really good . 
you know , i saw that 
and i cannot remember too much about it . 
it was the one where he was a defense , 
uh , not defense , 
he was a prosecu , cuter . 
and there was a murder of one of the women that was in the d a 's office . 
and then he ended up being accused of it . 
oh , that's right , 
i remember now . 
i remember . 
so , i mean it really kind of had a turn at the end , when you found out who it was .
well , i've had a hard time enjoying harrison ford in anything since the indiana jones movies . 
i think he ought to stay 
i realize that he would like his career to develop , 
but i don't want to see him in other things . 
but , uh , i tell you , sean connery in the hunt for red october , 
in the james bond movies . 
 i don't know 
he was too  .
i was never into those movies , either . 
i didn't care for the type of movie , 
but he was always slick , and greasy , and seemed to be conceited and had more women than he needed 
and i didn't like him . 
but , he has really developed into a marvelous character actor as he has come older . 
i thought he looked real good with a beard , too . 
oh , yeah , 
he does 
and there's a , 
i don't know , uh , 
i think that beard gives him a look that he is always grinning , whether he is or not . 
and he has that merry look about his eyes that looks like he stays in mischief all time . 
and , i enjoy those , 
and i enjoy some of the michael j . fox movies . 
i didn't care too much for the last one either . 
it just was not enough to it . 
what was the last one ? 
i'm trying to think . 
uh , the last , 
like , back to the future then  was the last one  .
it was called , uh , hard way , where he was an actor , trying to portray 
oh , okay , 
and that , 
hi ed . 
uh , books , 
actually i am reading a couple of different books , uh , 
one is , uh , a story , 
well it is not a story , 
it is a collection uh , of memos , supposedly written by howard hughes , uh , 
uh , that was , 
it came out a couple of years ago 
and i have just now gotten around to reading it . 
i have had it a couple years , 
but , uh , jus ,  , 
who wrote that ? 
oh , i do not remember the man's name , 
he used to be a reporter for , uh , i think , the new york times , or the washington post , one of the two , 
and he supposedly these memos he wanted to sell , 
and uh , in los angeles . 
they , on 
i think it was romain drive or romain street or something , there in los angeles , 
they used to have a , 
or , i guess they still do , uh , 
had a , uh , uh , big warehouse kind of thing , which had offices 
and it was sort of nondescript uh , you know , for the size of the company which , inside was basically a store house of a bunch of stuff he collected , 
he was , uh , a great collector of everything , 
he did not throw anything away 
and , uh , supposedly this guy had been breaking there for awhi , 
he was a , like , you know , burglar , had been breaking there awhile uh , 
i see . 
he had some accomplices that were kind of suspect , 
and well , i guess , in the sixties , 
well , that is interesting . 
so , it's pretty interesting work 
that is an intriguing type of book to be reading and trying to keep up on things like that . 
 it's a little hard   
you have to plod through it 
and , you know , it does not have a real story , or any plot , 
you just kind of have to read and understand what is going on . 
and , they have not made a movie of the week of it yet . 
i have not seen it . 
 it is real interesting , 
uh , i also reading , uh , uh , thi , 
it's another old book that i happen to have . 
i am sort of rereading it . 
it's , uh , a book about , uh , the bermuda triangle , 
but it's a real good book that a guy , uh , wrote who was , uh , a research librarian , 
he wrote , uh , sort of debunking many of uh , uh ,   the stories about the , uh , bermuda triangle . you know , 
 he was thinking many , 
in the atlantic , thinking they were flight nineteen . 
and i don't know if you are familiar with that at all 
but it's , uh , 
flight nineteen a collection of a flight of five navy adventures at the end of world war two . right after world war two , 
and they were lost 
and , uh , 
supposedly scooped up by the triangle . 
and in the book , you know , even , 
he wrote this book back in the seventies , 
 he had a very good case for the fact they probably just got lost and they ditched in the water . 
he goes through and brings out points from the navy's findings and so forth . 
and , uh , it's probably , you know , real close to what , you know , everyone is thinking , now that , they just got turned around and could not find their way back . 
on that same topic , have you ever read anything about , you know , the amelia earhart story , whatever happened with her ? 
uh , no , 
i think that would be , 
i am sure there is something out there , uh ,    , 
i would like to , too , 
because it's a lot of things coming up here lately about her , you know , possibilities of where she    , 
  i thought she  was a prisoner of war or something for like ten years . 
well whatever , this is one aspect of it . 
of course , you know , it is so weird , 
cause no one will ever really know , 
but it's entertaining 
and it makes you think about things . 
that is for sure . 
so , that is pretty much for right now , 
that is ,
i kind of like to read different stuff 
and , uh , i like to read a novel every now and then , 
but , uh , i am trying to get away from just reading novels all the time . 
well , i guess i just have not read anyth , 
i mean , usually , if i find a good book , i will sit , you know , for two days until it is finished . if it's that good , 
and i think the last one i read like that was scott thurow's 
and that was presumed innocent . 
and i just really , really liked the way he writes . 
it's just ,
i read that , too . 
i got it , uh , right ,
my , uh , you know , 
he was while he was writing the book , 
and , uh , my sisterinlaw lives in chicago , 
this guy is , you know , 
and , uh , i read it and really liked it 
and then about , 
that is when it really got big . 
and , uh , so i , 
that was good , i think . 
and the other book i am trying to think , you know , like was in the last year 
and i think i did read tom wolfe and vanity , uh , 
bonfire of the vanity   , 
i have not read that , although ,
that was really , really good , 
the movie was nothing compared to the book . 
that is what i have heard . 
i saw the movie , 
and , uh , 
oh , the movie was a joke compared to , 
i mean , because tom wolfe is so perceptive ,
i know . 
and , anyway , we are not talking about that , 
but , uh , gee , i like to read gardening books and things like that . just to tell me what to do with my garden 
i have a lot of , uh , uh , computer books that 
i do computer work 
and so i have a lot of those . 
 so , i spend a lot of time looking through those , not necessarily reading them but ,
but i'm interested in a lot of that , 
but , uh , i have got a lot of books that i intend to read , 
but i have not been able to yet , you know , for one reason or another . 
like , what is a book on your list , 
you know i have a list too 
and i have never gotten to it .
 oh , gosh , i do not really have a list , 
cause uh , i just have all the books out , you know , 
i have book shelves 
and i have them all out 
and usually when i am through with one , i will go in and , uh , uh , uh , look through , uh , 
i have one now and that i got is 
the sisterinlaw in chicago usually sends me for my birthday another good book 
and , uh , 
i have one 
and i can not remember the name of it , uh , 
it is supposed to be a mystery . 
okay , 
where have you all been on vacation recently ? 
my most recent trip was last year , 
and that was detroit . 
is that a nice vacation spot ? 
it was , um , uh , to see an old relative . 
and it was , uh , just to , uh , have some fellowship with her . 
so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot ? 
the only thing that i visited that , you know , is quite a tourist spot is cancun , mexico . 
ooh , that would be nice . 
and that was real nice . uh , 
did you scuba dive there ? 
ooh , that would be nice . 
and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit ,
oh , that would be enjoyable . 
i haven't been on vacation in a while either . 
um , usually when we go , we go to colorado , to estes park area .
oh , that's always refreshing to get away from . 
so it's a lot of fun . 
i worked up there last summer , 
so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the ,
oh , well , that's nice . 
worked at a camp there , 
and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains . 
so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation . 
well , uh , my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity , 
and that's canoeing . 
and , uh , they've been to the guadalupe river , 
and they also , uh , uh , have been to , uh , i guess colorado , 
and they've really enjoyed it . 
that's nice . 
it's a whole new , 
and that's the best place that i've ever canoed . 
it's really , really pretty . 
i was a little kid then , 
and we to have , uh , 
we stayed at some park 
and they had uh , mountain man who came down the river every night , 
and he would give a little talk about mountain things . 
you know , i think he wasn't a real mountain man , 
but we were pretty convinced he was a full ,
and we'd   
and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found 
oh , that's neat . 
and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening , 
but it wasn't ,
it was like , 
well , you learn a lot of , um , skills too , 
and i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older , to learn new skills , 
that's true . 
and i think penetrates in your memory , you know , what to do , because you really have a great interest in it .
so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning . 
and you're more receptive . 
well , that's good . 
well , we , um , let's see , 
the only other place i've ever vacationed , we'd , you know , go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that . 
and then i went to england 
oh , that's exciting . 
i was a ,
and that was a great time , because so , that's such a neat place 
and there's not a language barrier 
 so you don't , 
i mean , exactly know what they mean , 
and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents , 
but it was really fun . 
i really enjoyed that . 
i'm probably going back there to work ,
well , i had a friend that , uh , visited england well , i think it's been probably two years now , 
but that's her next goal , and she can do it , is go back to england , 
because she really has a great desire to do that , 
because the love that she , um , has for it now after visiting it . 
it's really nice . 
 i would spend all my time in london ,
and it was really different being in a big city , 
because i don't get much into you know , really urban areas a lot 
 and it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are 
and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone , which i thought i would just hate , 
but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone . 
you could just  ,
do your own thing . 
i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people . 
and i had a great time doing that . 
it was really interesting . 
that's wonderful . 
there's a lot out there to see , 
i know , 
 i'll say  .
i keep wanting to get up to , 
i haven't been anywhere else outside the united states . 
i haven't been to mexico or canada or , 
well , i lived across the street almost from canada .
so that's a nice place . 
canada is very nice . 
that would be nice . 
i had a friend from there . 
then i'd love to go somewhere in asia , 
but i'd have to have a tour guide with me to 
oh , yes , 
somebody that knows their way around . 
so , yeah , 
 that's why england was nice . 
even , we traveled in europe for about a week , 
and that was even nice because there wasn't , uh , the , 
most the places we went to germany and switzerland and , 
well , you've been quite a few places there .
we   .
 once you think about it , huh . 
it was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day , 
and you slept on the train at night . 
oh , that's great . 
but there wasn't a , 
it was strange , 
it was kind of sad , 
there wasn't ever a language problem there , because everyone in germany knew english 
and everyone in switzerland ,
that's great . 
so we were kind of pitiful . 
we found one restaurant we were in and got seated , 
and then no one knew english in there , 
and we  ,
but it was , 
what did you wind up with ? .
oh , i had fondue . 
that was easy to say .
oh , okay .
tried to get fondue and white wine , 
and that was , 
uh , uhhuh . 
we were able to have that pretty effortlessly . 
there were some people at the next table who spoke english , 
so we  ,
they kind of guided you . 
well , good . 
i'd love to go back there . 
there's just not time .
there's not enough time to go see everything , and then to afford to see everything . 
i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement , so when we do have the free time , we'll have the means to , uh , pursue our dreams . 
that's  , 
i guess that's what retirement is all about . 
that and sleeping late .
i keep hoping for . 
i understand that . 
well , it was nice talking with you too , craig . 
and have a good afternoon . 
you do the same . 
thank you . 
well do you , uh , keep a family budget 
or do you have some , 
my father who is very old has kept one his entire life , 
and i probably rebelled against it . 
i probably should have kept one . 
he keeps every penny that comes in and goes out 
oh , interesting . 
well , uh , we sort of started doing it years and years ago 
and my husband started graduate school , when we were first married , 
and i sort of just got in the habit , i guess . and , you know , never have gotten out of it . 
i cannot really say that it's a formal budget , 
it's more just uh , a fairly , uh , accurate , uh , recording of what i spend ,
and , uh , 
i think it makes much more sense , 
and i have recently , uh , gotten out of debt and everything 
and i will probably start keeping a little better ,
i just , uh , spent whatever came in never knew what came in and what went out .
that sounds real similar . 
so , i think it is probably better to have some sort of at least a record 
but my dad was so precise ,
oh , my , 
and , i mean , of course , he is from the depression , 
and , uh , 
but , uh , i think it would be smart if somebody would keep , uh , some sort of a plan that works for them . 
i think you are right , um , uh , 
well it must have been sort of interesting to us 
 uh , it's because , since i have pretty much kept my record books for the last fifteen years , i guess , i can go back and look 
and it's real fun to just see how things have changed over the years . uh , 
it is . 
for instance , 
i'm a historian , 
and my father had kept them , i think , since nineteen twentyseven 
my goodness . 
i could not believe he did that , 
but then , 
oh dear . 
but , to have looked back into the twenties , thirties and forties , it would have been fantastic ,
oh yes . 
but , uh , 
well , as a matter of fact , uh , my mother was going through some things not long ago , i guess it has been a couple of years ago , in an old trunk that she had . 
and she came upon a budget book that she had back in the thirties . uh , 
it was the late , well 
i guess i will take that back , it must have been in the forties , because they had been married , uh , probably fifteen years at the time . 
and , it was just , uh , fascinating to see how little things cost , 
i mean it was , 
of course , it's all relative , of course , 
i know . 
 but , uh , never the less it was fun to see those figures next to , you know , 
for a pair of shoes was like five dollars 
and  , 
i know , 
well even in nineteen sixtythree , 
i found a record that i had , uh , i travel in europe a lot and what i had paid for hotels . 
and a similar hotel in paris is two hundred dollars a night now . 
and i paid , uh , oh , between four and five dollars ,
oh , isn't that ,
and that's really crazy , 
cause that's about thirty years ago . 
oh , really something . 
oh . but , of course , it's just what the market will bear . 
that's true . 
if people will pay two hundred then why charge ten . 
you know ,    , 
 that's right . 
that's just good old economics working . 
 well , uh , we have tried to , uh , instill uh , of budgeting in our kids , 
but our two children are just , uh , as , um , unlike as night and day . 
and our daughter watches her pennies so closely ,
i mean , she has everything planned so closely ,
well , then you never know how they will , 
they may flip flop when they ,
the other one may be very careful , 
and she may marry somebody 
and , of course , it would be good because , you marry somebody a little loose , then she will have that stability of watching , uh . 
you should have one in the , 
i think that is true , 
i , uh , 
and i think , 
because i think my husband was not quite as , uh , good at saving and so on before we got married 
and i was really diligent about that . 
i was putting money aside before i was married , you know , when i was working out of college 
because when time came for him to go back to graduate school , we were in fairly good shape financially as far as not having any major debts . 
that's about the way it is here , 
if it had not been for my wife , i would have probably been in debtor's prison ,
 so but , what does you husband do now ? 
uh , he is an engineer , 
he is , uh , 
so we ,
oh , yeah . 
you have ,
and , you know , 
when you , 
my wife is still in school getting her doctorate , 
uh , yes . 
and it , uh , 
well , i'm working , 
and i have got , 
so , in fact , this last year we had three , 
both of the children were in college , 
our son has a year left 
and our daughter graduated this year 
and i'm just about ready to finish my master's degree , 
so we have had , uh , once again , you know , a real lean year for us . 
oh , i know . 
we had three , 
 but , uh , 
so that was four . 
so we were both in the same , 
you know exactly what it , 
and it's , uh , 
which you learn , 
i guess you figure that that is an investment that is , uh , really invaluable . 
that is the best one . 
with education you can't , 
that is right , 
so it's one that you can live through . 
and i ,
that's true . 
but , uh , well , i have enjoyed talking with you , jerry . 
i have enjoyed talking with you , kathy . 
and , i wish i could hear more about your historian part of your life , because that sounds really fascinating to me . 
i am interested in that . 
 well , if i had your address , i would send you , 
i am also in the travel business , 
and i can take some real great tours to europe . 
so , uh , 
oh , wow . 
well , my husband , 
um , actually we did not take a tour , 
and , uh , went to ireland and scotland and just rented cars and ,
but , uh , um , i , 
that sounds interesting . 
is your business in dallas then ? 
in the quorum . 
so , i'm jerry hammond 
and i'm out at brookhaven college , 
so you could just holler at me there . 
oh , you are kidding . 
well , i'm going to be teaching at brookhaven in the fall .
all right , 
what is your last name ? 
kuenzer , k u e n z e r , 
and i'm , 
k u e n , 
 and , i will be , 
 well good , 
i will , 
i have a couple of sections . 
 oh , well i know zack miller real well . 
that's the guy who hired me , 
yes   .
well wonderful , 
i will look you up in the fall then . 
well , it's been a good type conversation . 
well , uh , how do you view this whole subject ? 
are you , uh , one who feels like you in roles in women ? 
or what do you think ? 
oh , yeah 
there's been a lot of changes . 
i think there's still a lot to be made , though . 
i think so . 
 uh , are you someone who works outside your home , 
or have you , 
oh , yes , 
well , uh , have there been significant changes , uh , do you think in the employment place , especially , uh , say at t i . 
has anything in particular changed that you have noticed ?
uh , i guess there's more women in , uh , what would be classified as a man's job .
what kind of work do you do ? 
i am a drafter . 
i am in a man's job .
but we have got more women in it now . 
there's a lot of us in it . 
yes , uh , 
in years past , i know , in fact , even the word drafter  has  changed , 
because , it used to be they were draftsman .
we have some engineers that still , on their , uh , 
the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman . 
and i want to scratch it out and .
maybe not , huh . 
well , uh , when i was in college , 
i graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixtyfour . 
and i was a math major , which was a real rarity ,
so , i was in a lot of classes where , uh , i was either the only girl or , you know , one of just a very ,
so , that was a change 
and , uh , even ,  uh   , i did not , uh , use my math , uh , in my work , 
i became a technical writer . 
but , uh , even so , there were very , very few women in technical writing . 
but , that has changed a lot . 
oh , yeah . 
in recent years it has just really changed a lot . 
and i think that , uh , you know , the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management , 
but i think they have got a long way to go .
oh , definitely , 
there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the if you will , 
and i thought that , you know , that's a pretty significantly small number . 
so , there are some strides to be made there . 
but , uh , i do not know , 
i think we have come a long way ,
and , uh , 
do you , 
so , anyway . do you have children ? 
that's always a good question . 
 do you ? 
oh , wonderful . 
so , although there were some other women in her class ,
so , she definitely entering into , uh , a male profession . 
oh , yeah . 
so , that is recognized ,
but , uh , i do not know , 
uh , like in church , uh , where more and more women are becoming ministers .
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , it will be interesting to see if roman catholicism ever , uh , recognizes women in , 
i do not know if you are roman catholic or ,
i am not either , 
but , uh , that is one area .
not for a long time anyway . 
probably not . 
so , uh , uh , as highly regarded as men would be . uh , 
i was just trying to think . 
oh , i know something . 
maybe you could te , 
tell me what you think about this . 
 uh , the role of women in combat roles during the war ? 
oh , oh . 
because , i know that now there , they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles . 
and the only , uh , branch in the armed services that seems willing to do that is the air force . 
but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job . 
it was real interesting , 
television the other day ,
and , uh , one of the men who was a , 
i do not know if he was a general or , you know , what his rank was , very high . 
i mean , you know i can not tell you why i feel this way , 
but i just would rather have , uh , a man doing some of these jobs than a woman . 
but , that does not sit very well with a lot of folks , i am sure .
there's some men out there that are more feminine than most women .
you know ,  the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength ,
uh , because ,  you know ,  mentally , uh , and emotionally , i think women can handle a job and ,
oh , i do too . 
 and , you know , if she wanted to go to combat ,
i personally would not want to go 
but  , 
i would not either . 
i agree 
but i am sure that there are women who would relish that ,
oh , yeah , 
so , well , this is an interesting topic , 
um , you know , i have , 
having a daughter who has gone into engineering , 
she's a lot more forthright about her opinions and ,
so , that's progress , i guess .
 well , i have enjoyed talking with you lisa , 
well , same here . 
 well , i am not at home a lot . 
i am at work right now . 
oh , yeah . 
i put my work number , 
but , at home , uh , the recorder gets my calls . 
oh , yeah . 
usually , i am not there , 
that's good . 
i personally have not made any calls yet , myself , 
 but i enjoy receiving them . 
that's good , 
because , uh , i , 
see raising project . 
we got the connection through a t i , uh , church member . 
and , uh , uh , so we are doing it to raise money for , uh , a large project at church , 
and , uh , so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that's
that's wonderful . 
it's just real nice that way 
so , uh , i thought , well i will just get on the stick and do it . 
that's great . 
well , i will say goodbye to you , 
but i have enjoyed the conversation . 
well , thanks for calling . 
thank you . 
hi pat . 
one of the interesting things that i have considered about the role change for women is that women of my generation , were trained and taught and brought up to be the leave it to beaver housewives . 
but we are not living in that world . 
we are certainly not , 
our families have changed . 
families , 
society has changed . 
oh , yeah , 
everything has changed . 
that's one of the , 
and it makes you really concerned . 
i am glad i raised guys . 
you know , let the world train them what to do .
but characteristically , you know , the women are trained , or have been in the past trained in the home . 
and i really would be at a loss to raise and train a girl . 
i think i would . 
well even raising boys today is different though , because ,
oh , sure . 
you know , used to be they would just go off to work and come home , 
and you know , everything was done . 
and it's a different world . 
oh , sure . 
it's nice that there's a choice . 
i have chosen to stay at home ,
and i have a ten year old and a twelve year old . 
and i was a single parent for awhile and worked . 
and that was great , 
 and i was able to provide for my children 
and you know , 
but i thank god everyday now that i have that choice .
and uh , i volunteer a whole lot . 
and , uh , that's my job right now . 
and i love it . 
oh , yeah . 
i really love it . 
then i went back to work . 
and that will come . 
i know that day will come , 
and i am looking forward to that too . 
but that's a different phase in my life , 
and i am glad that i am able to do what i want to do right now . 
well , you know , there's a lot of things that have happened , actually , 
it's like oil on top of water , 
it changes 
but it's never different 
 uh , women at one time did very heavy physical labor 
then as times changed , uh , as it is today , we do not do a lot of physical labor ,
there's not a lot of physical labor ,
you are not beating rugs , 
you are not , right , 
and in that respect , we have to make ourselves become involved in physical exertion , 
or we really do develop some health problems . 
so , in that respect i am not so sure that the hard work of years past was not better for us than we are willing to admit . 
and , uh , 
but don't you think it's that way with men too ? 
i mean , you know , men are sitting behind desks a whole lot more ,
oh , absolutely true 
but specifically the woman's role ,
and , you know , medical reports tell us that women are developing diseases now that used to be predominately male diseases . 
heart disease was characteristic of men , 
now there's almost equally predominant in women . 
 and i , 
and stress disorders and things like that . 
uhhuh . 
and , i think that that's a symptom of our society , 
it's a symptom that there's a general illness that needs to be healed . 
i do not know what the healing process would be or what was causing the problem , 
i am not god . 
you need to get them ,
you need to get them into this , 
they need to be busy 
and they need to be active . 
and i fought all of those things , 
i want to do it , 
otherwise , i will guard their ability to have quiet time . 
you know , it's funny , 
i refused to cram their lives full . 
it's funny , 
i was rea , 
 and that's the way it is with a woman too . 
and it's been real busy . 
and actually , today is really as far as i am concerned , the first day of summer .
and , uh , you are right , 
uh , well that's how society has changed , uh , 
the family has changed , 
 you know , we find ourselves doing things that ,
you know , i do not remember ,
it's different , 
it's just , 
i do not know , 
only time will tell whether it's better or worse ,
but , uh , 
of course . 
well , i just am very much a believer in quiet personal time . 
if you do not have the time to talk to yourself , who are you going to talk to . 
and i guarded my children's rights for that 
and i think that that's one of the things that women are sacrificing that they should not do . 
they are sacrificing their time with themselves . 
there's nothing wrong with sitting and being bored ,
you are finding out who you are . 
but is not that difficult to do when you are working full time and have to come home and prepare a meal and ,
well , i think , 
and , you know , where do you find the time . 
um . well , in the first place it's not your homework , 
it's your children's homework . 
and i was always very careful to be there only when they came to me and asked me for help , 
i helped them with exactly what they asked for 
and that's all . 
that's a part of the problem that women have always had 
and that is accepting responsibility for things that really are other people's responsibilities . 
that's very true . 
that's right . 
that way husbands are crippled , 
they are intellectual cripples , 
and so are children . 
they do not know how to think for themselves and be responsible ,
i do not know why god made women brilliant .
didn't he though .
but i do not know 
they tend to look at the mother as the one who solves all problems . 
that's very true . 
and that's never changed . 
that's very true . 
 as a matter of fact i was talking to a friend yesterday , who said she has a new policy in her home 
i am having a problem with ,
and i say , no , 
i will not . 
you know , you work it out for yourself . 
every single person in this family expects me to get , 
and they suck me into these arguments and ,
that's right . 
and and soothe everybody . 
i just , 
you know i think that's one of the things that we have today that is very useful , 
and i think every woman ought to deal with it or , ought to at least be exposed to it , 
and that is mediation training . 
um , uhhuh . 
uh , we are not talking about strikes or things 
we are talking about mediators who get involved in family crises ,
because , the mediator is an unbiased bystander who , 
 we're to discuss a little bit about the process of putting someone in a nursing home and making the decision on a family basis 
and , probably the first question would be whether you've ever had to go through that process . 
they live down in college station where ,
and they put her in a home last year . 
she appeared to have a couple of light strokes and started to , uh , not be able to be in her apartment on her own . 
 so they found a place nearby that they put her in last year . 
so it was pretty much a physical decision ? 
uh , yeah , 
it's just she had had her own apartment and drove a car and everything up until that point . 
then she was starting to which is kind of frightening when she's in the car . 
my husband's family are reaching that point 
but it's so difficult . 
was she in favor of it 
 or was she kind of opposed to it ? 
 well , yeah , 
i mean , it wasn't a very , um , strong stroke . 
it was just kind of all of a sudden she wasn't herself anymore . 
and she got kind of fearful of being on her own . 
she never really ate very well . 
it was one thing . 
she hardly 
and she didn't eat . 
she ate very poor 
so i think she was , you know , bad , uh , nutrition on top of it . 
and , uh , she got to the point she didn't want to alone anymore . 
so often i think though , elderly people don't realize that their diet is that bad . 
i work with a lot of elderly people , 
i'm a trust officer 
 and so often they think they're adequately caring for themselves when they're really not eating or very balanced meals . 
well , she was almost ridiculous . 
like she'd eat ice cream and cookies . 
well you know that's part of the aging process ,
didn't one , 
it really is . 
oh really ? 
well she didn't want to cook for herself anymore . 
 oh , that's too much trouble . 
that's too much trouble . 
didn't want to cook . 
and the portions , 
people don't want to try to figure out little bitty individual meals . 
i do that right now , 
 and i'm not near nursing home age . 
although they've got , uh , meals on wheels ,
so as a family you all just visited nursing homes 
i know a little bit more from a coworker . 
her motherinlaw had been in for quite some time and had different degrees of a place that she was in . 
um , she was ambulatory 
and so there was a lesser care . 
uh , then she got , uh , uh , hip broken 
and then , uh , she wasn't as ambulatory 
so they 
but , i remember from her checking around , she ended up staying at the arkansas house i think out in arlington , something like that . 
and , uh , .
oh yeah . 
that's a given . 
they're always saying that somebody's going to , 
and some of them , i think unconsciously do it , you know , 
 and sometimes the help there does it , i think . 
uh . o , they , uh , don't have too many facilities it seems for their personal items .
but , um , at least they all seem to have , uh , you know , people that monitor their , uh , medication intake and dining facilities , you know , go to the dining room 
i know when my friend's motherinlaw first went in , i mean , very antisocial . 
i don't understand 
as i think i mentioned , i was in the trust business 
and i've seen so many elderly people . 
usually there has to be some wealth involved , which is great , if you don't make the decisions so late that you're worried about money 
they're able to move in while they're still independent 
 and they do group things . 
and then if health or mental capacity deteriorates , they're able to take the next steps without so much change 
and oh , i wish everybody could go that direction rather than just all of a sudden moving out of the home they've always been in . 
it's really kind of difficult . 
i have a , um , 
my aunt's mother is , uh , gotten ill recently 
and , uh , she lives in pennsylvania , 
they live in alabama . 
i don't to men , 
it seems like the women just out live their husbands , but , very reluctantly , 
they don't get out of the house , 
they don't socialize 
but it's my home 
and i don't want to leave it . 
well and it's the first step and aging . 
you know once you make that step you know that it's just going to be downhill from then on 
and i've seen people really fight it that desperately needed 
 they became , 
in fact , that's probably what's going to happen with my husband's mother . 
she's going to endanger herself before she'll willingly and probably will never willingly make the decision . 
and that scares me the thought of forcing somebody to do something . 
 but it's so lonely , 
you know they can't get out and see anyone 
it's a house , 
it's walls 
and it's furniture 
not as independence . 
don't you want to be close to me ? .
i just don't understand why they , so much want to just stay in 
 and there's no family there , 
they don't get to see their grandkids , 
they don't get to see their children , 
they just there in that house . 
and the quality of life really isn't there . 
 oh it's tough , 
it really is . 
that's from the child's standpoint . 
what does that house got attraction ? 
 well , they fear being dependent 
i know they're really proud of independence . 
they fear being a burden 
my husband's mother will have major surgery 
and we'll find out about it in a casual conversation . 
she'll let something slip 
 and that's it , 
she , just , well 
i didn't want to bother you . 
she can't accept that we want to be the care givers . 
 well , when she got home , who took care of her ? 
well , she stayed in a temporary nursing home .
you know , it's just , 
but it's frightening to us because we live pretty far from her . 
she's down in temple 
 and we can't see her often enough to really know what's going on . 
 so , it's difficult , 
it really is 
and we're all heading that way 
and we've pretty much planned that we'll be here in the dallas area 
so we thought maybe we could get them to move a little closer here . 
we're talking about capital punishment . 
how do you feel about that  lenore   ? 
i am very much for capital punishment . 
well , wonderful . 
i am too , one hundred percent . 
my dad retired from the federal prison of bureaus . 
and i've been raised around prison 
all your life . 
and i believe if you don't have a punishment befitting the crime , there's 
there's no deterrent . 
that's right . 
there's just no deterrent . 
that's right . 
and so many of those kind of people , they have a better life in prison than they have on the street anyway 
so , you know , unless they really make it rough on them going to prison for a little while is not much of a deterrent i don't think . 
especially not a federal prison . 
well , i don't know what oklahoma's laws are 
but texas's i don't know are , 
i don't know 
it's no one's f , 
i mean it's not the judge's fault i don't think . 
it's just the way the law is down here . 
man our , uh , prisons are so crowded that , uh , they can commit some pretty serious crimes and be set free within a year to two . 
well , see uh , the state's prisons were under a mandate to , uh , 
it was over crowded 
well , that's what ours did , same thing . 
but , uh , we have , 
the death penalty is not given often . 
but there have been w , 
it's not here either really . 
and you know , i , 
maybe i won't say sparingly , 
but i do believe it should be befitting the crime . 
i do too 
they've got so many chances for appeal , 
but i think it needs to be expedited . 
you know if they've been convicted and given an appeal and they're still convicted of a lethal injection , let's do it and not waste so many years to do it . 
of course , you know , they're entitled to a speedy trial . 
that's right . 
but then they're also entitled to drag it through the courts 
that's right . 
somehow it just doesn't , 
it works and then again it takes too long for it to work . 
and it seems even though , you know , that they  got   , 
i just want out . 
you know , i'm tired of fighting it . 
then the system just keeps on . 
it equ , 
and at that point you know i really think there needs to be maybe a shorter appeal process . 
i do too . 
i think that needs to , 
and i don't see why it couldn't be shortened considerably . 
but , you know  , 
well , part of that is the overcrowding of the court system . 
that's true . 
it is overcrowded because there's so much uh , problem with the people on drugs 
because that ha , 
they're robbing and killing 
and , uh , that's why it's filled the prisons up so much i think . 
uh , it doesn't help them any at all 
it doesn't . 
 and , of course , your court system when you get into the appeals , 
i don't believe criminal is in a court by itself . 
and the whole judicial system is backed up with a lot of junk that shouldn't be in there . 
that's true . 
with all these lawsuits and people suing people over ridiculous things 
we've gotten into a very litigious , uh , type of life . 
boy , haven't that we though . 
we really have . 
but anyway i'm glad to hear that you agree with me on the capital punishment . 
well , i just , 
i'm very  muchly  for it . 
always have been , 
always will be . 
i just feel like their crime and punishment 
and if you don't have the punishment , you double your crime . 
and you know , that is just personal feeling . 
it's not going on facts . 
i think 
it could be supportive . 
well , yes . 
um , tell me some about your camping experiences , carolyn . 
well , um , i have gone to girl's camp a few times , as you know , a chaperon or a leader , whatever 
 and , uh , i enjoy camping . 
we have a tent , 
and we've gone , even with our family a few times out camping and have a camp stove , um , 
i guess my biggest memory is when we froze to death .
we just didn't take enough blankets and 
uh , we went camping at , uh , lake bonham , which is pretty close here . um , 
we went fairly early in the season for this area , which is probably april 
and it got really cold at night , 
and of course we were close enough that we could go back and get some more blankets and things 
uh , uh , what activities do you do when you're camping ? 
oh , we take little nature hikes 
with the kids , and just that kind of stuff . 
usually try to have uh , occasionally a camp fire at night , you know , and 
well , that sounds like fun . 
uh , i grew up in south dakota , up in the black hills 
 and so we used to go camping , 
my dad would take us , 
there was four of us kids , 
he'd take us , 
and we'd all go camping , my dad and my mom and the kids , 
and it was always fun , uh , 
because what i always remember is , my dad would let us pick our camp spot 
and it always had to be somewhere near a river so we could go fishing , 
and hopefully we'd catch our supper , 
but we never did 
 but it was always fun . 
we'd always , 
mom was always prepared 
and she'd bring along , you know , something , because tradition had it we would never catch anything , 
so we always had ,
but then we'd roast marshmallows , 
and it was always an enjoyable experience . 
uh , about nineteen eightytwo i moved from rapid city in the black hills , 
i crossed the state to aberdeen , 
and , uh , there's no hills , 
it's flat , 
and then i was in high school , 
and , uh , and go fishing , 
but by then , of course , i was able to uh , catch some things , 
but , it was always fun . 
it was a different experience camping in the hills versus camping just by a river 
 you know , in the hills you know , and look for animals , 
and we always , you know , 
in the hills , you can see quite a few different animals , 
go ahead . 
we used to live in utah 
 and , uh , of course , there's lots of mountains around there to camp in , and streams and stuff . 
that's a great place to go camping , 
and the hiking is just really great . 
you know , hike up those mountains 
now uh , are there any mountains or big rocks a person could hike around this area . 
there's woods and things out in east texas 
there's a tyler state park that's , uh , really a nice camping area , 
but it's just a lot of trees , 
it's not , 
i don't know of any place in texas that has , uh , really big , you know , what i call mountains .
the rocky mountains are so much , uh , 
the one in tyler , has it been pretty commercialized , i suppose ? 
they have , um , screened in areas , you know , 
they're not really cabins , i wouldn't say , 
i guess they could call them that , but they're more just a screened in , uh , camping area 
they're not bad . 
the pests out , i suppose . 
well , that sounds , 
i don't know if i can rate camping , 
but , you know , it sure beats driving a thousand miles , to find a mountain , i guess . 
that's right . 
i take it you haven't done a whole lot of camping in this area . 
oh , i see . 
well , you're just trying to get over the culture shock still .
if i 
well , really the ideal times to camp in this area are early spring , and , in the fall . 
it just gets so hot in the summer you can hardly , 
i mean , there's a lot , 
what type of things do you feel would invade your privacy every day ? 
um , huh . well , i don't like it when , uh , people listen to my phone conversations , like if they're outside my door while i'm talking in my room  ,
that's right . 
that is really an invasion of privacy . 
i find it very annoying when i've worked all day to come in and my phone to ring constantly , the solicitors , and the carpet cleaning companies and , 
does that happen in your part of the country ? 
and i am trying to get a few things done 
and i can't do anything but answer the telephone . 
some evenings are worse than others , 
but i wish i could put a stop to it , 
but i don't know what to do to stop it . 
even , uh , we used to have a sign on our door that said no soliciting , 
and they would still come to our door 
they would think it didn't mean them , i guess . 
i guess not , 
everybody but me .
do you live at home with your parents ? 
uhhuh . 
so your privacy is invaded probably by other members of the family . 
now what can you do to stop that ? 
oh , i don't know . 
well , i am used to it now , 
but sometimes it sort of gets to me 
but there is not much i can really do . 
no . 
just have to live with it , i guess . 
try to remember to respect their privacy , 
and maybe they will respect yours 
well , i don't know .
i always , 
do you have brothers ? 
uh , no , 
but they don't live at home . 
oh , okay , 
i was ra , 
i had two younger brothers , 
and they nearly drove me crazy listening to telephone conversations 
oh , i used to do that though because i was the youngest , 
i would pick up the phone and listen to theirs .
but i , 
i would get in the bathroom and lock the door so maybe they couldn't hear me , 
and then they would go get on the other extension 
 and i could hear them , 
but i couldn't get them to hang up , you know . 
but i stopped doing that a long time ago , 
and they still do it to me . 
hang up . 
oh , like , s , 
this lady does that to me at work 
and she'll just sit there and listen like i'm doing something wrong , 
and she just started 
and , she is nice 
but , you know , it gets annoying when they stand right over you watching everything you do . 
but , i , 
let's see , i can't think of anything else 
about the only thing that really bothers me i don't have that many people coming to my door . 
well , occasionally we'll have a person here or there , but not as many as the phone calls ,
and i guess that's really the thing that really bugs me the most . 
i can't think , tha , 
our kids in our neighborhood used to bother me , 
but they've all gotten grown up now 
 and we live in a neighborhood where there is not any little kids to bother me ,
but . what else would be an annoyance ? 
well , i guess traffic could be an annoyance . 
oh , yeah . 
especially when you're in a hurry .
do you have a lot of traffic in your area ? 
usually in the week i'm   .
some days it's real , real bad here , 
and you would like to , feel like it's an invasion of privacy because you can't even ride down the road without people all the way around you ,
i've traveled quiet a bit , 
and i've been through dallas , texas . 
it's pretty busy .
it really is , 
and pretty noisy . 
it really is . 
i live right on a main thoroughfare , 
 so when i first moved here i probably did consider that an invasion of privacy 
because at first you'd hear a lot of noise , especially at night 
oh , yeah . 
and every time a fire truck or anything went down the road , i would wake up , 
but i guess i have gotten used to it because i don't even hear it anymore . 
oh , yeah , 
i suppose you do . 
and , uh , i just close it out , i guess , because i don't remember waking up in several years at night when i'd hear a fire truck go by , you know . 
i think they would probably have to pull into my drive before it bothered me .
i am a real solid sleeper though 
so that probably wouldn't bother me . 
i'd sleep right through it .
it takes a lot . 
 let's see . what else is an invasion ? 
i had an old boyfriend who looked through my notes one time .
i was mad because those were mine    , 
well , did you have has name all over them ? 
it was a letter from a girlfriend of mine . 
i was upset because those were mine , 
and , you know , i thought he , 
that was yours . 
i thought he would respect me more than that ,
so that was upsetting . 
i was mad about that and my privacy there . 
uh , well , i guess social change takes in a big category , 
but , uh , i guess the one aspect of it that i took in , uh , consideration is more economical . 
has greatly changed . 
i agree . 
i know , they did a , 
it was on a talk show , 
they took , uh , the parents and then uh , the son , 
and they compared income at different points in time you know , was a little bit younger and more in his heyday 
and they compared to the son's , that he was making now . 
and even though the son was probably more successful , you know , higher up in the management ladder 
and it's depending on where you live , though , too . 
i know uh , just with me , ten years ago , i was comparing the , 
i think i was living better ten years ago than i am now , even though i'm making more money now , 
but my dollar went a lot farther . 
that's true . 
ten years ago i was eleven .
oh . i remember though , like buying candy and stuff that was a lot less expensive than it is now .
and i used to hear stories from my grandpa , 
and , you know , he could see a movie for like a nickel and things like that . 
well , i know gas prices have definitely jumped , uh , from , uh , 
i know i used to pay twentyfive cents a gallon 
and now it's over a buck . 
i don't know what it's , uh , by you . 
around here minnesota , wisconsin area uh , it's dropping , 
but i think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average . 
i'm from wisconsin , 
yeah ,   .
well uh , that's unu , 
most of the people i talk to are texas , 
oh , yeah , 
i spoke to a person from texas , too . 
this is only my second phone call 
so i'm 
i suppose this will be one towards my last one pretty soon , 
so they'll stop me 
 but , uh , uh , i'm pretty much out to the things to say . 
oh , like social changes . 
um , um , and i don't think this would have anything to do with it , 
but like clothing and styles , lot of those changed . 
like i say , it's a broad category , 
it's just i'm not economical 
towards each other . 
would have been considered , uh , feminine , uh , many years ago , 
but now i kind of like , you know , a lot of the bright colors . 
i mean , like i used to be more , uh , conservative and just your basic colors , 
but now i do like some of these , uh , brighter , fluorescent colors . 
but styles come and go all the time , though . 
it's just ridiculous , fads in and out . 
and even , um , clothing from the sixties came back . 
i see a lot of , um , girls wearing sixties clothes . 
of course , is the mini skirt , of course .
but , uh , 
i don't think that there's anything as original , 
it's all based on , uh , one of the past styles , 
they just , um , make their , uh , circle and come back again . 
so if you hang onto your clothes long enough , uh 
that's true , 
maybe some day i probably won't be alive to see it , 
but prices might go down lot more . 
i don't know though , 
doesn't look good . 
well , thinking back , i think the only style i hope doesn't come back is bell bottoms . 
i remember that , 
i do .
i didn't really care for them either .
but now i , 
i was going to say , my , uh , college is northern state university in aberdeen , south dakota , 
and our head football coach , dennis muir  , used to be an assistant coach at b y u . 
oh , really . 
so i thought that was kind of an interesting coincidence . 
so you went to what college ? 
uh , northern state university in aberdeen , south dakota . 
and what did you graduate in ? 
i ju , 
international business . 
oh , really . 
and you ? 
i'm going to b y u , 
and i'm going into nursing 
well , that sounds interesting . 
how long of a program is that ? 
seems like , anyways . 
it's about five years , 
but it's probably going to take me longer , because i didn't decide to major in that until , uh , about a year and a half after i was already in school , 
you know , i read a study once , 
and it said that , uh , like thirtyfour percent of , uh , college students actually graduate in four years from a four year program . 
oh , really . 
that sounds . 
 it took me five years . 
 so , you get started 
and you change your mind , 
or you want to pick up a second major , 
it's just only was three more classes 
and just doesn't happen that you get out in four years . 
so what is your advice to 
my advice is 
if you're going to go to a college where student faculty ratio is three and four hundred to one , i don't think you're going to have as meaningful of a college experience as if you're down to the thirty to forty to one . 
is that , what was yours more like ? 
was there a , 
it was about twentysix to one . 
oh , that's great . 
which is , you know , 
it's interesting , 
but it's 
what i thought was nice is there was always time to talk to professor , you know , 
and they knew you . 
you weren't just in their class , you know , 
and so you could go talk to them in their office almost at any time , 
or if you ran into them in the student union or whatever , you know , you could sit down , talk to them about a problem . 
they're always willing to help you out . 
i put that against , uh , my high school where we had , uh , a biology class of three hundred and fifty students 
wow , in high school ? 
it was a biology lecture class 
 and , you know , it just wasn't the same . 
you're sitting there , 
and you're taking notes 
and , you know , you got a computerized test scores , multiple choice , because there's no way they could correct a three hundred fifty point short answer test 
and , it just wasn't the same . 
 you'd pass the teacher in high school 
and , even in high school you could say high to your teachers , unless you're in that biology class , 
or should i know you ? 
the classes here are pretty big , 
so , it's hard to get individual help .
it's kind of , you're on your own .
do you get , uh , a lot of tutoring , 
very little , i mean , 
well , like my , 
for example , i'm in a chemistry class right now 
 and there's tons of students in it , 
and there's one t a for the whole class . 
and he only has certain office hours , 
and so there's only certain times you can talk to him , 
and you could get there 
and i mean he could have like a nine to eleven in the morning office hours and have fortytwo people waiting to talk to him , 
and you still didn't get to talk to him anyway . 
well , what would be your advice to a parent of a child thinking of attending college ? 
oh , man . i think your advice is good . 
um let's see . my advice would be to pick a major before you get into college 
that's excellent advice . 
 because i didn't , 
and i took tons of classes that i didn't need to , 
and , um , i don't know , 
i just feel like it's going to take me a lot longer than , 
and not that's always bad , 
but it's , 
i don't know , 
it's frustrating , i guess . 
well , it does get it . 
you know , i mean , i was taking summer classes 
and   let me get out of here . 
but , uh , no , 
that's good advice . 
even if you don't have your major decided on , have an idea what you think you might want , you know , 
so you don't want management , 
but you think you want business , 
i haven't , uh , talked to anybody outside the metroplex , 
so i didn't even think of saying arlington , texas . 
this is a real first .
are you at work ? 
i've been trying to get people at five thirty and six thirty in the evening 
i'll try the middle of the afternoon . 
well , i'm happy we got through . 
i am , too . 
well , do you have any , uh , opinion on the subject ? 
well , what's happening in the soviet union , uh , 
the move to , uh 
is that reported in the texas papers ? 
uh , we hear a little of the news . h , 
i have heard about that the last couple of days . 
how big is the ukraine , the area , 
do you know ? 
uh , as an area , it's not , 
or a population or anything , 
i'm really uninformed . 
i'm afraid i don't have the statistics in front of me . 
 , it's not a tiny area . uh , 
if i was looking at a u s map , i would say it of a , uh , 
it's not as big as california proportionately . 
it's more significant , in the sense of , it's a great agricultural region . 
oh , i see , 
oh , i didn't really know that , 
and , uh , what about astonia , 
are they , 
they're completely out now . 
i thought they were . 
the three baltic , uh , republics got out as quickly as they could . 
of the agriculture ? 
of the soviet union . 
uh , so there were probably really fight to keep it in if they could . 
except they can't fight .
they don't , 
it's done democratically , uh , 
didn't i read that ? 
so , now , uh , not that may matter , 
i don't know , anymore . 
i , uh , fear for the russians from what i read , you know , 
i wonder how they're going to get through the winter .
sounds to me like they'll start rioting soon , or not that that would do any good , 
but i guess people do that when they're desperate . 
that's true , uh , hasn't happened here for a while , 
but it , uh , 
well , that's true , 
since the depression , 
i guess when the veterans went to washington 
and well , you know , the war riots , of course . 
let's just hope we don't get to that point .
things are not so good in texas job wise . 
 i hear you have some problems . 
well , we do . 
we have lots and lots of , uh , layoffs here . lot of companies folding , lot of layoffs 
and it's pretty scary . 
the government in washington for this ? 
well , i don't understand economics that well . 
i don't know , 
i know that we have a terrible situation with foreign trade and that other countries put a lot of restrictions that we don't 
 and so i assume that that has some effect . 
and uh , i mean , they said during the way , reaganbush years , the rich got richer , 
the poor got poorer , 
the statistics prove that 
so , uh , i guess , 
so then , you think it's reagan and bush have done this 
or is it just coincidence it was during this period ? 
well , i really don't know . 
i think uh , maybe they contributed to it . 
maybe they should pay more attention or , you know , to the more equalization of the trade . 
of course , if somebody in china can make something for ten cents and we have to make it for ten dollars because we have unions , well , i don't know what's going to happen then . 
oh , the chinese use slave labor , too . 
that's one of the ways they get away with it . 
and child labor . 
well , i don't know . 
what do you think has caused our horrible situation ? 
uh , i don't think there's any one 
one thing . 
i mean that's very complicated . 
well , they say , too , that having a democratic congress and republican president is not good . 
i mean , i've read that is a theory . 
so which one are we going to throw out ? 
 well , i hate to say it , 
but , i'm tending to go straight back into my original democratic party . 
oh , i know , 
it used to , 
well , you don't want too many democrats anymore 
and for a while i kind of deserted the party , 
but now it's looking better to me . 
i like your governor . 
oh , do you ? 
oh , i'm glad to hear that . 
she's an impressive woman . 
well , i think so , too . 
i just , admire her a lot . 
and , uh , i really hope she does well . 
but she's , uh , you know , probably more popular out of the state than she is here , although she did manage to win . 
but look who she was running against , you know .
well , yeah , 
anybody could beat claytie in texas . 
he shot himself in the foot so many times .
oh , i know some of the people . 
go ahead . 
well , uh , we're going to compare notes . uh , 
uh , i 
don't do it .
well , i tell you , i firmly believe in exercising . 
i think it's a , 
i do it every day on a regular basis . 
of regiment do you have ? 
well , i just got back from biking twelve and a half miles , 
but this time of year , you can't get much biking in . uh , 
but every morning i use this president's , uh , council of physical fitness 
and uh , uh , it's worth doing , 
and you can do it anywhere . 
i travel quite a bit in my 
and you can do it , you know , wherever you're at 
and if you do it , 
i do it every morning 
and , uh , now what i do , 
i mean , i've done this for , you know , like fifteen years , 
so you don't start at this kind of regiment , you know . 
so , what i'm telling you isn't something you go out and do 
and you'll hurt yourself . h , 
every , uh , 
it takes me about fifteen minutes to do this now because i do it all the time , 
but uh , i do twentyfive , uh , uh , where you have your arms above your head and 
and i do , uh , ten , uh , right and left , uh , trunk twisters . 
and i do , uh , about sixty , uh , bicycle , uh , leg thrust type things . 
and i do , uh , twenty , uh , leg lifters on each side . you know 
and then i do fifty pushups and do a hundred sit ups 
and , uh , then i do about , uh , 
my goodness , 
you do all of this in fifteen minutes ? 
oh , yeah , 
and then , uh , thirty , uh , 
now if you did football , like the old grass drills where you're on your stomach and you 
 you know , prone type things , where you're kind of rocking on your stomach type thing , 
and that takes maybe about thirteen minutes , uh 
now what keeps you doing that . 
i mean , much more modest efforts , 
but i give up , 
i just find them boring . 
hard to 
well , uh , 
years ago i used to , uh , referee football 
 and , uh , to stay in condition , i did that , uh , just as a normal 
and , uh , uh , i tell you just by doing it , uh , 
well , example , this summer i was about fifteen pounds heavier than i wanted to be 
so i increased , 
i do three hundred sit ups a day now , but not in the morning , 
i do a hundred then 
and then i do about a hundred before supper and about a hundred before i go to bed . 
i lost fifteen pounds just by doing that because you tighten your stomach muscles 
 and , you know , you can eat anything you want , drink anything you want , 
but you don't , you know , 
within reason , you know , you can lose weight or maintain your weight 
 and , uh , i just , you know , 
you're ready to go at a , 
i think it's really important . 
well , whenever i do it , i feel good . 
a regular habit that i just can't 
well , that's why 
well , i like biking 
and during the summer , i'll do , you know , at least seventyfive miles a week 
there's excuses , weather 
 or you don't have time or something like that . 
but if you do some basic exercises and you say every morning , just like brushing your teeth you're going to spend fifteen minutes or a half hour .
 and once you start getting into that , you just feel good 
 and you look a whole lot better . 
does your wife participate in any of this 
and there's no way i can get her to . 
 like it's something you either just really want to do it 
or you can't talk anyone into it . 
if you don't like to exercise , you know , it isn't going to happen . 
i sure wish she would . 
she's , you know , unfortunately overweight , 
 but she's a wonderful woman 
well little bit of peer pressure would help considerably . 
but you seemed to have any external 
no problem at all . 
and , uh , if you get one of these mats .
one of my kids got me one of those for christmas one year 
and , uh , 
what's this mat , i mean , 
it's just an exercise mat that rolls up 
 so you can put it up , you know , just in the corner . 
is it like the sort of thing you take on a camping trip 
 well , yeah , 
 i mean , it's that kind of like 
 but it doesn't , 
yeah . 
yeah , 
and it's just about six feet long , rolls up 
 and i don't take it on trips with me . 
you could , 
but , uh , i don't mind , uh , you know , 
if i do like sit ups , i'll throw a towel down or something .
so you don't have the abrasive , 
what do you think about , uh , the self insurance business ? 
well , i watched something on t v a couple of months ago by , uh , ex , uh , surgeon general koop . 
and he talked about canada's system 
and it appears to work fine for the normal colds and things like that , 
but the expensive stuff , heart , uh , operations and things , they have a managed scarcity . 
and they said that in canada , there were as many heart , uh , trauma centers as there is in san francisco . 
so in one city uh , heart operations as in the entire area of canada , 
and that's kind of spooky . 
well , uh , i understand what you're saying , 
and there's probably some truth to that . 
i think that , uh , generally i don't welcome added government responsibilities . 
however , when anybody can't police their own profession , it eventually leads to that , 
and i think the costs and uh , the way the medical profession has , every year 
i , being in my own business , uh , 
in the last six years , every year there's been at least minimum twentyfive percent increase in health insurance costs , 
and i think eventually the number of people that can afford health insurance , as it is now getting squeezed and squeezed tighter . 
uh , i think they're asking for it . 
just pushing until there's no option but the government take it over 
and , uh , 
do you think that it's just , uh , medical guys ? 
what about , you know , you know how expensive new equipment and technology is . 
that's where i think most of the cost is coming . 
well , i think a lot of it is , uh , 
but , uh , my wife this last summer , uh , when we were on vacation tore up her knee , 
and , uh , uh , it was ligaments , uh , in her knee , 
she came back that , uh , 
we were out at cape hatteras when this happened 
and , uh , she got home , 
and the leading orthopedic man , who has handled football people for years and is as good as they come , 
i mean , he knows knee problems okay , 
i mean if anyone does , this guy knows it . 
well , she goes in , 
but , uh , you better go to the hospital and have one of these m r i things . 
a thousand dollars for this , uh , oh , magnetic , uh , resonance imaging type thing . 
i mean , uh , you know , i suggest you go have this thing . 
insurance won't pick this up unless you're in the hospital . 
 now , a , 
 oh , great . 
i mean , doctors routinely send people in for anything . 
now , for years they didn't have this 
and they solved these problems , 
and , you know , 
  yeah  .
but i think a thousand dollars , 
these guys , 
i don't know what it is , 
but there's , 
  uhhuh  .
and even if they cost a hundred , two hundred , five hundred thousand dollars , at , uh , roughly a thousand dollars every half hour , uh , that's ridiculous . 
i don't care what anyone says . 
you know , the costs are not , 
it's a picture . 
it shouldn't cost more than thirtyfive bucks for something like that , you know , reasonableness . 
but they aren't reasonable . 
fifty , a hundred dollars . 
they don't have to pay them back in three months time . 
i'll have to agree , 
  you know  .
but there's another problem , 
and that's how litigious our society is . 
if the doctor makes a mistake , he can be sure that he's going to be hauled into court . 
well , i think another problem , 
but that's part of our legalese problem . 
and that , the government eventually will address too just , you know , because it's out of control . 
i agree with you . 
you know , uh , i was on a jury 
or i didn't make the jury , 
but there was a ,
like it was three days after it was born , 
and he was the one that delivered it . 
and they got four attorneys , 
one guy out of houston , he introduced himself as snake soandso , 
i got problems with .
i mean , you know , five million bucks isn't going to bring this kid back , you know , 
i mean , as sorrowful as it is . uh , you know , if the doctor is wrong , you know , he should be pulled from his license , 
but five million dollars and away he goes because insurance pays for it , you know , 
it doesn't make logical sense to me , 
but , uh , 
it doesn't . 
uh , that's , 
well , aids is a nasty , terrible disease , 
and you die from it . 
so i think that , uh , they need to look into it 
and it's kind of like cancer . 
i don't , you know , 
how many years have we tried to find a cure for cancer . 
i think it'll probably be as difficult . 
uh , how about yourself . 
um , well , i'm certainly in favor of aids research , 
and i think probably the government could spend a bit more money on it than it does . 
i think that 
because , besides the fact that it's a deadly disease , that it's a contagious disease , so that it's , um , 
although it is not killing that many people now , it still has the opportunity to get out of control and become a huge problem . 
they say a million people are infected 
and , uh , yeah , 
i think , 
 uh , in the country , america . 
oh , really ? 
um , that's , 
 and they have millions . 
whose figure is that ? 
i don't know . 
i've just heard it on the radio . 
sometimes you hear things on the radio that , you know , could be true or couldn't be . 
uh , do you feel like this is , 
i guess they're spending a billion or so a year on this aids research . 
do you think they should spend more ? 
and i don't necessarily think that they should , uh , fund aids research and , in the process , neglect cancer research or whatever . 
i think that it would be a good thing for the government to increase funding for medical research in general . 
what do you think , doug , of mister johnson ? 
magic ? 
um , i don't know , 
about gay sex or intravenous drugs or anything like that , as they probably would for a lot of other people . 
do you think he's the hero that he's being called by a bunch of the media ? 
but i don't think it's anything exceptional that he's doing . 
it's what many people have done already , who were just less famous . 
you know , i took advantage of the opportunity when , you know , he came out . 
i talked to my kids about it , you know 
it's something that i hadn't done before . 
well , that's good . 
i'm glad that mister johnson's changed his tune on , uh , safe sex to abstinence , 
uh , let's see . 
what are some of the other questions . 
uh , you don't , uh , 
let's see . 
i don't have any friends that have the disease . 
i guess you might not . 
um , yeah , 
my cousin , does , for instance . 
is it pretty 
and , um , 
he's actually , um , 
he had aids related complex for a while , 
and he is now in fullblown aids , really not doing very well , and has a brain tumor or that sort of thing . 
it sounds awful . 
it's a very nasty thing . 
is it just that the immune system ceases to function properly 
um , yeah , 
and the white blood cell count goes down , 
that's aids related complex , 
but then when things get completely out of control and it basically hits bottom , that's aids 
 and in that case , you know , people are prone to getting any kind of , you know , weird cancer that only animals got before 
oh , really . 
that sort of thing , 
there we are . 
all right . um , um , well , uh , 
tell me about the car that you've got . 
 well , i have a honda , um , hatchback , nineteen eightyfour . 
and i had a hatchback , a nineteen seventyeight version before this one . 
and , uh , i'll be honest with you . 
i have never found any automobile that has been more conscientiously constructed and , uh , put together 
and it does its job . 
all i have to do on my honda is change the oil and the filter every thirtyfive hundred miles , 
and two new front tires on at fifty thousand miles , 
but that car just purrs like the day it was built . 
i get fortytwo miles per gallon on the highway and uh , twentyeight to thirty driving around in town . 
it's a five speed straight stick machine . 
and , i can carry more in uh , that trunk area in my little honda than i can in the big cars , 
and i have a large , um , pontiac , 
and i have a sixtynine cougar , which it's old , 
but it's in beautiful shape . 
but i can carry as much in my honda or more than i can in those other bigger cars . 
well , that's very interesting . 
i've had exactly the same experience with the one that i've got . 
it's a , 
and surprisingly it's also an eightyfour 
oh , oh . 
 and , uh , 
l x ? 
i'm still here . 
um , i'm sorry what ? 
it was an l x ? 
it's not a hatchback , 
but um , it's , uh , 
yours is a four door . 
and very , very comfortable car . 
big roomy trunk 
 uh , uh , and very happy with it , 
and i must admit it's , you know , 
if , uh , 
my only consideration were , you know , buying another car just to tool around town in and make , you know , brief trips and things like that , 
i would very seriously consider buying one . uh , 
i think they're extraordinarily reliable cars . 
they are . 
um , a steady , um , trip down the road about once a month , because i'm divorced 
and i have a daughter that lives down in north carolina 
um , uhhuh . 
 and , uh , i drive ,
and it's just an absolutely wild highway . 
ninetyfive is wild in any car . 
there's no doubt about that 
 because i run over to crystal city , or used to , 
i'm retiring the end of this month 
 but i'm very much aware of the crazy driving that goes on over there . 
and , well , you've got it , 
as the one that i've got my eye on , which is a volvo . 
in fact , quite frankly i've owned a volvo in the past , 
they're expensive cars to keep up when they need service , 
but , uh , i've found that i've had a lot of luck with them . 
uh , course i'm a mechanically inclined kind of person , 
and i always wind up getting under the hood and finding out all the things that , you know , need to be taken care of , and so forth . 
and i guess that's one thing is there's just very little that you have to do under the hood , 
and , uh , 
it just sits there and purrs , 
and all you got to do is the main major thing of changing that oil and that filter . 
i get six hundred miles on a tank of gas . 
oh , i know . 
it's really amazing . 
it's , uh ,  , 
beautiful , beautiful machine . 
so , um , yeah , 
anyway , i've been looking at the prices of these cars and so forth , 
and i think that it's very surprising some of these very expensive volvos can be gotten for a lot less money than you would think if you're 
is that right , 
 and , um , 
well , a brand new volvo costs , what , thirty thousand dollars ? 
you can still the low end wagons , um , for less than twenty thousand dollars 
 and , uh , we get , you know , 
in the washington area , of course , being as affluent as it is , there are lots and lots of volvo dealerships down here 
um , uhhuh . 
 so there're lots and lots of them available in the paper at any week , 
and i sort of , you know , scan the paper and look at them , and so forth 
i think i've bought one or two new cars in my life , 
and i've tended um , to , uh , buy cars that are , you know , two or three , and sometimes even four and five or six years old . 
this honda that i have i bought used , 
and , in fact , it had an extraordinarily low amount of mileage on it . 
i've just rolled seventy thousand miles , 
and it's i mean , an eightyfour . 
well , my eightyfour just has seventyseven on it 
 and i've made many trips to washington and down to virginia beach , virginia , where my mother lives , and things like that , 
and i drive it , 
oh , yes , 
very appropriate , i guess . 
uh , you ready for this ? 
okay , john , 
just a moment . 
well , guess what , 
we get to talk about the weather .
the weather uh , this time of year has actually been kind of unusual . 
i haven't expected it to be colder until , you know 
like we've gotten the last couple of days . 
i don't know . 
i fly for a living , 
and i've , uh , 
the weather's been terribly unusual every where i've been . 
oh , you do 
 so you probably go everywhere 
i imagine it's kind of an experience also trying to land and take off in the weather . 
i'll tell you that .
 well , actually set back since nineteen thirtytwo . 
no kidding . 
so , yeah .
if it keeps on raining like this , 
and i understand it's supposed to rain until saturday night . 
saturday or sunday they were saying , 
oh , yes . 
i know the systems have been real strong out . 
i went through , uh , phoenix twice on , uh , wednesday morning 
 and , uh ,   approaches to low minimum   both times 
 and phoenix never gets that kind of weather 
 and so are you an airline pilot ? 
oh , great . 
for southwest , 
for southwest , 
i have a brother that's a pilot , also , with american . 
oh , is that right ? 
so i imagine uh , oh , with all this kind of weather it , uh , makes it kind of dangerous for you . 
uh , this really isn't bad stuff to fly around in . 
this is much better than dealing with the thunderstorms in the springtime . 
oh , i guess so , 
yeah , 
the air systems are reasonably calm . 
we don't have , uh , the turbulence 
but it's not like it is in the spring time . 
oh , yes . 
well , we moved actually down here from another location , 
and it's spectacular the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time , the torrents of rain . 
spectacular is the right word for them . 
pardon me ? 
i've never seen a thunder show like i've seen down here before in texas . 
it's amazing . 
lights up the whole sky and even on a , 
actually i've seen it where there's not a cloud in the sky , 
it's a cloudless night , 
and the rain isn't falling , 
but you can excuse me , see the lightening going horizontally across the sky 
oh , yeah , 
it's fabulous . 
cloud to cloud it can be really sensational here . 
that's true . 
where are you from originally ? 
i'm from , uh , northern utah , 
and that's a very arid climate , from , uh , salt lake city area 
 and there's always a lot of snow . 
in fact , where i grew up we were about an hour's drive from seven to , uh , twelve different major ski resorts , 
and so 
and because it was an arid climate , the snow was always a crisp , powder , light snow 
oh , yeah . 
oh , yeah . 
so , we had a great time . 
were you near the park cities area . 
um , yeah , 
beautiful area . 
so i imagine , have you skied before ? 
i've driven through it several times . 
uh , we skied california a bunch when we lived out there , 
and we do some skiing there 
oh , yeah , 
well , do you think the weather is typical for this time of the year ? 
i , you know , 
minnesota's gotten just hammered with snow , um , 
the , um , uh , 
we've gotten a fair amount of rain for this time of year already 
 and , uh , i've been surprised that we haven't seen more of the temperatures that we've got today , you know , that moved in last night . 
it's been cold . 
there was a time , though , in the , uh , middle part of november that got really cool , really , really 
it did . 
 and then it warmed right back up , 
and i thought , great 
 and that's a fun th , 
my wife was just listening here 
it froze in fact . 
it was real cold . 
but that was very unseasonable for us down here . 
uh , but , uh , i've really enjoyed the weather down here , too , 
because , uh , two years ago we were the day after christmas able to go out in shorts and play tennis in the nice sunny weather , 
and it's not as severe , i should say 
oh , yeah , 
that's real true . 
same with us from minnesota . 
it's , uh , 
in fact , on , uh , new year's day one year . 
down here ? 
not in minnesota .
i have a brotherinlaw that lives in minnesota 
and they say , boy , six months out of the year it's bitter cold , and 
oh , it is , 
well , and they've had , uh , you know , 
usually in minnesota they get their snow in january 
and they're up over sixtyfive or sixty , 
i guess tonight's subject is , uh , woodworking . 
do you , uh , 
well , kind of , mainly the woodworking i've done lately is , uh , made like , uh , for example a little nativity scene .
and so i enjoy doing a little bit of woodworking 
and i do it out of hobby more than , uh , you know , something i have to do . 
how about yourself ? 
uh , well , i like to think of it as a hobby , but i guess also , partly out of necessity . just repairing things around the house . 
uh , a few years ago , uh , uh , they needed some book shelves 
and i kind of drew up some simple plans to make some book shelves 
and , uh , it actually worked pretty well 
and over the years i've refined those plans . 
i got myself a router 
and i'm very good at making book shelves . 
it's also a way of relieving stress . 
my wife kind of laughs ,
that sounds like a good idea . 
i , you know , 
and that is right , 
it is out of necessity 
because lot of the things uh , well , we can't be able to afford , 
but also i sometimes think that , uh , i enjoy doing that 
and i like to get out and , uh , to work with my hands 
and , uh , sounds like you got some real nice tools , too . 
do you think you would be able to do some more if you had more tools and different tools ? 
uh , well , yeah , 
uh , gotten a good belt sander 
 and , the router , uh , helps a lot because you can make better joints with a router . 
the latest project that i've been working on and this has been kind of sitting here for a few months is to put a t v in . 
oh , a entertainment type center ? 
and it , to suit whatever equipment you have 
so i 
and , uh , that's worked pretty well . 
uh , uh , with the router you can make nice , uh , 
i guess dado joints is what it's called . 
or yes , 
and also with a router , you can , uh , make ornamental facings , too better than a just straight wood edge .
that's right . 
so that's good . 
but what i need next is a good table saw . 
and uh , just a straight table saw or to get one of these , uh , rotary arm saws . 
radial arm saw is , i guess , what they're called . 
uh , it is better , 
well , it takes up less room . 
i mean , you set the wood down 
and you move the saw . 
whereas if you're ripping wood , you're probably better off with a table saw . 
well and with a radial arm saw , if you do have a big piece of wood that you need to rip , like you say , or cut , you wouldn't be able to do that . 
uh , but , uh , yeah , 
a table saw does take excuse me a lot of space and is a pretty big investment . 
uh , that's partly my problem now . 
i don't have room for this . 
 uh , i , 
 uh , where we lived before up north , uh 
they don't have basements . 
well , i'm from up north also 
 and , uh , no 
there's no basements down here 
and it's kind of , uh , hard to get , uh , shop space unless you have a dedicated shop or a dedicated room 
lot of the equipment , too , that you know , i've used in school 
and , uh , i would , 
i don't know , 
for , uh , chairs , for , you know , decks and so forth 
i just enjoy woodworking 
and i think it's a good out . 
it's an opportunity to get out and relieve some of the pressure that you feel day to day 
and it's a great stress reliever . 
have you ever used a lathe ? 
and i've made , uh , uh , different things , uh , uh , tables for chairs 
and i've made , uh , bowls , 
 uh , and , uh , 
did you hear our topic ? 
it's in regards to discussing homes . 
homes , 
yes , sir , 
are you settled in a place ? 
i've been in it for uh , actually thirteen years , since nineteen seventyeight 
and it's in richardson , texas , which is north texas 
 right  .
and we've lived in two houses in richardson . 
we moved here in seventyfour and , uh , changed locations in seventyeight . 
how about yourself ? 
well , we , uh , left here in seventysix . 
uh , we were here for a few years , 
then we , uh , have come back just this summer . 
right now we're looking for housing , uh , somewhere down in the duncanville and cedar hill area . 
are you familiar with that ? 
it is . 
the kids are in school here in duncanville . 
we're in a temporary place right now 
uh , so they've enjoyed the school , 
so we're kind of trying to stay here 
are you finding it tough trying to find what you want 
well , the problem we got is that we've got five children 
oh , boy . 
 four or five bedroom house 
and , uh , you know , everybody says , you know , how many houses are on the market and 
so uh , we look at the paper , 
we talk to our realtor 
and you can cut , you know , the listings , uh , in about a third when you go from three to four bedrooms 
are you looking 
or you settled , 
i mean , 
and , uh 
i'm probably older than you , 
i'm fiftytwo , 
but anyway , my youngest is getting married this year 
oh , great . 
so i can board up their rooms ,
that empty nest syndrome is going to set in , i guess . 
oh , gosh , 
so , we're looking forward to retiring in about three years and 
are you from florida originally ? 
but uh , my wife's parents are from the new york , new jersey area 
 uh , has seem to relocated down that area . 
oh , yeah . 
seems like a nice place to go .
we've got five 
and the oldest is , uh , ninth grade 
and the youngest is second grade 
and i think they're going to be , uh , with us forever . 
i don't know if that's true , 
but it's sure , you know , we're not anywhere near looking to , uh , uh , cut down in size . 
oh , i 
you need very minimum four and probably five . 
oh , yeah . 
in fact , six would be real good . 
my wife and i can share a bedroom .
oh , i don't think it's possible unless you , you know , multimillionaire , something like that . 
oh , i know . 
seems like you get in that category , you're in the three hundred thousand dollar homes or whatever 
and it's 
oh , yeah . 
it is , 
uh , we're having , 
actually , if we find something for , uh , i'd say less than a hundred and twenty thousand , we'll be doing all right , you know . 
that's , uh , 
but i think the thing's out there , 
it's just a matter of , uh 
lot of people or do something . 
i had a young lady used to work for me at my office from the high school 
and uh , there were seven kids in her family . 
and they converted the dining room and ,
but they always seemed to get along fine , you know . 
oh , yeah , 
i think once we get into a place , it will be just fine , 
oh , sure . 
oh , i know 
and there's nothing harder than that . 
i always just sort of assign my wife that chore , 
then i would let her narrow it down to three or four , 
then i'd go look because women seem to like to look a lot more than men do . 
oh , yeah . 
at least she's got more opinions , you know , 
 uh , seems like there's more constraints 
why , certainly . 
i'm in the , uh , sporting goods business . 
i'm a manufacturer's rep . 
i represent fourteen different hunting and shooting type companies . 
oh , yeah , 
who are you with ? 
uh , we're with an organization called , uh , wycliff bible translators . 
it's a missions organization and , uh , doing , uh , translation , linguistics , that sort of thing . 
well , great . 
uh , it's got an office down here near duncanville 
and we just moved down to be on staff down here 
how was the , uh , 
you say you lived in the denver area before ? 
how did that compare with this area as far as housing prices ? 
uh , we were , uh , really surprised to find that they're higher here . uh , 
no kidding . 
when we moved from louisiana to denver , it was astounding , you know , to find that prices were , oh , i guess almost two or three times as high as we'd expected . 
and then , uh , to come down here , we thought things would be lower , 
and they're not . 
i guess , uh , really , prices for housing are just , 
all right . 
uh , i can begin this , um , 
basically i work for honeywell in minneapolis 
 and the benefit program we have here is really quite good . 
i'm pretty pleased with it . 
they cover , uh , just about everything , vision , dental , medical 
 uh , you name it , 
and for me this is the first job i've had where they've covered that much , 
so i'm pretty satisfied myself . 
um , what's your situation ? 
i work for the university of new hampshire , 
overall i'm satisfied with it . 
we don't have the vision care , 
we do have the health care or the dental . 
are you a professor there ? 
and uh , at the university of new hampshire . 
oh , i see , 
uh , so uh , the benefits , 
uh , probably the main thing i like about the benefits is uh , the , uh , very generous vacation time and sick time . 
oh , no doubt .
we get fifteen days a year sick time , 
and , uh , right from the day one when you start work , you get twentyfour days a year , uh , time off . 
well , that's good . 
yeah , 
that's one of the things i guess i would change about honeywell , is , uh , 
i used to work with the army research institute , 
and being uh , a government organization you got quite a few holidays off . 
but here you don't get that . 
you maybe get two or three a year . 
so it's really , 
some sick leave or whatever , um , you kind of have to finagle your way around to get that time . 
so , that's kind of a drawback i think . 
but , uh . i don't know . 
what do you consider most important , you think , in terms of the different benefits ? 
well , i think , uh , the health care , of course , is an important , and has to be the single most important benefit 
 and , uh , the rates that we keep paying seem to keep increasing , uh 
i'm a little disturbed about that , 
but i think that's a national trend , 
and uh , i don't know what the solution is to it . 
it's bigger than just the benefits part . 
i don't know if you saw on twenty twenty the other night , 
uh , they basically reviewed oregon's plan 
it's kind of an interesting plan . 
it's kind of cold though . 
they've essentially made up a list of , uh , oh , all the different , uh , medical maladies that you can have 
oh , yeah . 
about six hundred and eightyseven and below will not be covered by , uh , subsidized health care , 
and the ones above would . 
so it's kind of like drawing this line 
 and if you have it great , 
if you don't , you're kind of out of luck 
 but , um , it was kind of an interesting show . 
i think you're right , 
i think health care is probably the most pressing 
but i'll tell you , i don't mind having dental , you know , 
sometimes dental costs can be , um , just about as expensive , if not more , 
and i know historically a lot of companies i think carried dental as a rider along with the medical 
 but i'm not sure that's widely followed any more . 
i'm not sure , 
how does , uh , university of new hampshire handle it ? 
well , we have two different plans that we can subscribe to under dental , uh , depending , 
is very little . 
i think it costs me something like five dollars a month for the dental plan . 
but it pays , uh , a substantial amount . 
i mean , the examinations or every six months are free 
 and , uh , it covers the bulk of the dental expenses . 
and also staff and administration , 
is that generally across the board , do you think 
uh , yes , 
the benefits plan is different for what we call operating staff , which are considered to be , uh , clerical personnel , accountants , things like that 
 but the main , 
i think the health and all that and the dental is the same for everybody , and the retirement plan . 
oh , okay . 
uh , for the operating staff it's it's , you know , based on how long they've worked there . 
that determines how much , uh , vacation time they get . 
i'm kind of interested because actually , that's the route i'd like to take when i finally get my degree 
i'm a doctoral student in florida right now 
 but , uh , 
that's interesting . 
that's one of the things i'd like to think about is in what kind of benefits uh , they would cover and things like that . 
college programs belong to this t i a a , uh , c r e f retirement fund . 
oh , is that right ? 
and in the case of the university of new hampshire , uh , 
all right . 
what's your view . 
 well , i have a hard time thinking that they can control guns .
that's true . 
i mean , 
you know , even if they give it a shot , it's still going to be black market all over the place , you know , 
that's right . 
i don't know . 
coming from texas you're probably , 
i don't know 
i shouldn't make stereo types , 
but gun control is probably frowned on quite a bit down there i would think . 
it is , 
but i'm not really from texas , 
i just live down here now . 
i'm originally from colorado , 
but yeah 
 oh well . .
 uh there's a lot of hunters here . 
well i know how you feel . 
 uh , i grew up in nebraska 
and we always use to go out and hunt all the time , you know 
that's just , 
i don't know . 
i think it's ridiculous . 
i mean , 
it doesn't sit with me very well . 
i don't know , anymore 
i keep a thirtyeight in my truck , you know . 
i just about all , 
well i live in minneapolis 
and i , 
well actually i live in florida , 
but i am staying in minneapolis for a year 
 and it's just , you never know who is out there . 
you know it's just for self protection purposes 
and then of course there's the hunting issue , 
what do you do , jeff ? 
uh , i'm in , uh , program control for a company up here . 
oh , yeah . 
all right . 
we do schedules , for 
what do you do ? 
i'm , uh , researcher of honeywell up here . 
oh , okay . 
so , uh , 
you guys  , uh , do you get much of a chance to hunt or anything 
i don't own a shotgun , 
but i'd like to go bird hunting . 
 you know 
uh , when i was in colorado we went deer and elk hunting 
all right . 
my brother was , uh , a guide for bear and elk hunts out in idaho for a while and , uh , really enjoyed it quite a bit , 
but i don't know . 
i guess that what the scale now is , it's zero uh , for a complete , 
one for a total ban 
that's right . 
i guess i am about eight or nine .
i agree with you there .
no doubt about it 
but , uh , 
i mean , if they can anyway get it , keep criminals from having guns which they can't 
 you know , i'm not 
if there's 
here while back waiting period 
and then they actually , uh , 
i know it's this way in florida . 
they have a waiting period where you buy one 
and that's a week 
 and then they check you out and make sure you don't have a record you know and things like that . 
i think that's a pretty good idea . 
uh , and that's , 
i don't know , 
that's not a bad idea , 
but then again you can always get around that . 
you could go through the black market like you say . 
you know , you always be able to get around 
but , uh , 
it's one of things 
but , uh , i don't know . 
i guess some forms of guns should probably be controlled just like i'm not real sure why anybody would need a full automatic weapon . 
i don't either .
i'm just not , 
i think those have been pretty much , you know , banned altogether anyway . 
fully auto , 
but , even well , i mean , a semiautomatic , i guess that's , 
it kind of takes the sport out of hunting .
you know , it's like what can you do with that , that you can't do in a self protection situation with like a seven or a twenty shot twelve . 
you know , you might do the same thing . 
and so it's like , i don't know . it does . 
it takes the sport out of it . 
for me i would much rather have a bow anytime .
oh , really . 
i like bows . 
you know , i have done some bow hunting 
and uh , i get into it 
and i think it's more of a challenge , you know . 
but , uh , i don't know . 
i guess it keeps the shell makers in business . 
but , uh , i don't know . 
anyway , that's about where i stand .
me too . 
you , uh , 
i am about the same way . 
and uh , have you eaten yet or whatever . 
is it seven o'clock there ? 
uh , yeah , 
you guys central ? 
how is the weather up there ? 
oh , it's not too good . 
it's kind of rainy actually . 
is it ? 
around this time of year you expect it up here to get down to about , uh , i don't know , ten or twenty degrees 
 and it's been up around forty . 
so people are whining about the rain and stuff , but not too bad about the temperature . 
ice is starting to melt and stuff like that 
i am just up here for the year 
and it's kind of shocking . 
wendy , i guess we get to talk about budgets tonight or lack of budgets uh , if that may be the case 
do you have or a monthly budget , or a long term budget that you stick to ? 
right now i'm in college 
and i'm on work study 
 and so my budget comes from my dad's help . 
he helps me out a lot 
and i get paid monthly , 
so that's kind of hard to have a budget . 
my mother , uh , doesn't get paid much money , 
so her budget is , uh , just , uh , planning for i r a's . 
i see , 
well , good , 
i'm kind of in a different situation , 
but i went through that , too , when i was in school , 
but , uh , and , uh , trying to make it through that , 
but , uh , 
i'm on a salary 
so i don't get any overtime or anything like that 
and we have to make sure that , uh , every dollar we have is spent accordingly 
and , uh , what we try and do to stick to our monthly budget is 
we have the insurance premiums , uh , utilities and so forth 
and we do sit down at the beginning of every month or the end of every month and write down how much we know we're going to spend and set that money aside , 
and we also try and set aside money for savings , set aside money for the kids' education 
 and we also set aside an emergency fund 
that sounds good . 
and we find out that , you know , no matter what kind of budget you stick on , there's always going to be an unexpected car repair or something 
and , uh , then we have , you know , 
whatever's left over is yeah , discretionary income , 
and it's worked out very well . 
uh , it's helped us , so that we haven't been , you know , too long on the month and too short on the money and 
well , that's good . 
and , nice thing about it , is excellent in that we both work together , 
we both have a budget , 
and we stick to it 
well , good . 
 and there's no surprises in that .
with two kids , that could be hard . 
well , actually i have four kids . 
i said a couple of kids , 
i guess i should have specified , 
i have four 
oh , my goodness . 
four boys . 
you bet . 
oh , my goodne , 
you bet . 
it's just me and my sister . 
all right .
and my parents divorced three years ago 
 and my sister had gotten through college , 
but i was still in high school , 
and my mother paid for a lot of my sister's college while my parents were together 
 and then , uh , before the divorce she had saved for my college . 
but , uh , when we had the divorce , she just didn't get much money out of it and had to spend it all on getting another house . 
so now my dad's paying for all of my college of .
well , good , 
and financial aid 
i'm a music major , 
 so i have auditions coming up . 
well , what year are you in in college ? 
i'm a sophomore . 
so you have a few more years . 
two and a half years left . 
well , good for you . 
i imagine it , uh , is a little difficult to stick with a budget during that , during school and so it forth . 
i know how much my dad is going to give me every two weeks 
 and i don't spend over that .
well , great , 
and sometimes that's a little hard with books and music and sheet music and stuff you've got to work on , too . 
oh , sure , 
there's always music 
lab fees and all , 
 oh , yes , 
well , you're not a starving artist , yet , are you ? 
oh , no , 
i don't plan on being a starving artist .
well , good . 
that's why i'm in college .
i'm glad to hear that , wendy . 
that's usually because they're not real educated . 
they can't afford to have a really good job . 
who's not very well educated ? 
the starving ones . 
oh , yes , 
there's enough out there that if you're educated enough , then you can make money . 
that's true , 
i found that out . 
so that's why i'm planning and preparing for the , uh , education of my children , also 
what did you major in ? 
i majored in business administration . 
well , good , 
you know plenty about planning a budget . 
but , uh , once again , 
it's not been a good day .
 i went , 
i don't know . 
i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with carolyn 
so i hope she's turned it in . 
are you eating ? 
uh , i ju , 
go ahead , 
i'll stop eating . 
i just barely got 
no it's , 
say what ? 
go ahead , 
fire away . 
 . uh , i love the irony of , uh , talking about this subject on april the ,
but , uh , i'm afraid i'm probably in the minority . 
i actually don't think that we , uh , pay too much in this country . uh 
i agree with you .
uh , i guess i do have a bone to pick with , uh , uh , the way taxes are distributed .
uh , i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form 
 and the sales tax can't . 
i think that's regressive 
and , uh , uh , it's kind of dumb . 
i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax . 
but , on the other hand , i don't mind that it's only on , you know , things that aren't like groceries and that , 
it's not on that . 
well , i mean , nobody taxes groceries . 
 oh , yeah , 
they do . 
in arizona . 
is that right ? 
but we have a i mean pretty low tax rate here . 
oh , i think the sales tax , they just got to do something about it . 
but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes . 
but i guess their rates are like , uh , fortyone , fortytwo and ours are like thirtysix , thirtyseven , you know , 
if you compute as a percentage of total income , all taxes lumped together , we actually do pretty well . 
that is taxed as low as we are . 
well and i still think that , having lived in europe for awhile , you know , difference in living conditions 
i'm not sure i understand what you mean . 
well , i mean , i think , 
i was in germany , you know , for several years 
 and i'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have , then have to live there . 
 oh , you mean , lowest end of living in spite of higher taxes . 
higher taxes . 
i suppose that's true , 
uh , probably less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever 
still's that way to some extent . 
i think the other problem is , you know , it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you , theoretically , can do something about . 
but i look , for example , 
and you're not quite in the same situation 
but like school taxes for me 
i wish i didn't have to pay any more to my physicians in a year 
since , uh , i send my kids to parochial school , that   .
that's probably a little tougher on you .
it's not quite the bargain that   .
 but , i mean , i pay them gladly . 
that's a decision , 
i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a , uh , two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools with the same tax money . 
but , uh , i mean , that's the way americans want to interpret it , 
i guess that's all right .
and if i were , uh , 
when i was single and again when i'm retired ,
that's always been a high priority .
i think that's just you though . 
i do , 
that's true . 
i think in places , 
and , uh ,  , 
that seems like a cultural lapse . 
i mean , people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools . 
of course , i think with the graying of america , we're going to see that problem in lots of places . 
people would rather , uh , increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them . 
but i think it's sad 
or build roads . 
wonderful touch tone telephone there . 
 uh , what kind of books do you enjoy reading ? 
uh , of hobbies , 
therefore , my reading pleasures are quite wide . 
um , i get a charge out of , uh , texas highway ,
i've read that one too . 
i only had a subscription once , 
but my mother always gave me hers 
and i really enjoyed , you know , all the little things that you find out about texas . 
oh yeah , 
 uh , absolutely , it's great the way that it's broken out and you can , uh , set up little trips and day trips and things . 
it's pretty neat . 
um , oh , i like photography , um , magazines . 
i don't take a subscription or anything like that . 
um , things , oh , 
being an engineer in facilities i do read and plant engineering magazines and , read up on different ways to do things and energy management type of magazines 
and then i'll sit up and read just to refresh , uh , you know , to keep active on it , 
but , uh . 
how about yourself ? 
well , um , i have an interest in art , 
so i , frequently purchase and read , uh , books , mainly on water color because that's my big interest at the moment . 
oh , that's great . 
and , uh , oh , i guess i like a variety of things , uh , lots of fiction , uh , type books . 
uh , right now i'm occasionally reading on a book about , uh , the mardi gras in new orleans and its history . 
that's fairly interesting . 
i bet that would be , rather interesting . 
uh , that's , uh , self improvement , 
 well , that's kind of a hobby 
but it is self improvement from the standpoint of probably relaxing , uh . 
i don't know that i read anything strictly labeled self improvement . 
how about you ? 
um , well i hate to , 
uh , we have these classes we attend , uh , management classes 
and they give you books 
and the last book , uh , matter of fact i read was , at america's service by carl  albrecht  .
it talks about , uh , who the customer is and being customer oriented , uh , which falls in line with the t i culture here at texas instruments . 
uh , so that's all in self improvement to stay focused on who the customer is 
and as you probably well know , all of us are our own customer . 
you're my customer , i'm your customer , sort of thing . 
um , every now and then i'm loaned a tape i can stick of pat hagerty and these kind of , uh , mind stimulating philosophy type .
well , uh , maybe i am into some things occasionally that i don't think of in terms of self improvement . 
i mean they are 
but i don't label it as such . 
like what for example . 
well , i don't know , um , 
i , uh , have attended some seminars that had some tapes that went with them , but , uh , i guess not so much books although they sometimes have manuals and things , 
but , uh , they would be things on like how to be successful and sort of talking to yourself . you know yourself in gear to , uh , sort of pull yourself up by your boot straps and do what you really want to do .
how about items like , um , the one minute manager , which used to be a big , 
so those are self improvements . 
um , our supervisor , uh , subtly bought all of us a book called what every supervisor should know .
and it's a very layman's , uh , uh , approach towards managing different types of people . 
and the very last chapter , and i haven't figured out why that one was last , is how to manage engineers .
so it's interesting , 
here again it's casual reading 
and it's not eaten up with a lot of , uh ,  mechanical  stuff 
and it's really excellent fast reading 
to know if it's , you know , 
i think if somebody would say hey , read these ten books because these are selfimprovements , i would probably be turned off to them . 
if he casually just walked into it and , uh , put down a stephen king book and i picked up one of them i might be a little more interested . 
i don't know , 
i'm not sure i could take too much of stephen king . 
that's a little heavy for me . 
 uh , they're hard to set down because it's so interesting 
and , of course , they're all just a little spookier than the movies , 
but , uh , 
i have a hard time finishing books . 
well i guess i also have been reading , uh , a lot of things on , uh , quality improvement and that type of thing because that's what i'm involved in a lot at work . 
in quality , especially now days , uh , that's almost everything that comes across the airways   .
oh , yeah , 
you could almost label everything quality in some sense or other 
but , uh , 
exactly right . 
yeah , what it is we're saying . 
i think it's just focusing in on the issue and walking your talk 
 and all that kind of rolls in together there , 
but , uh , that's just kind of part of it . 
well , any other comments . 
um , i think i'm under my quota a little bit . 
i need to probably make a phone call or two .
well we just started , 
uh , this is true . 
i've enjoyed it . 
well you too , 
and uh , goodbye . 
have a good day . 
i don't know about you 
but where i am we have like an extremely lax dress policy at work 
and it varies like every day . i mean from jeans one day to business suits the next .
it's pretty bad , 
but it's true , you know , 
they tend to try to be , you know , real lax 
and supposedly the policy is like , you know , you know , we , hire these wonderful creative people 
and we don't want to  smush  their creativity , you know . 
we want to go ahead and let them do what ever they want . 
and , you know , you really will see people in jeans one day and business suits the next . 
well , i'm kind of that way too . 
i work in the legal department 
and where we are now , what we're doing is some very big lawsuits that happen to have a heck of a lot of boxes of documents . 
and i get to toting around boxes of documents several times a day , 
it always seems like i'm doing that 
and i can't see getting dressed up and wearing heels and stuff when you have to carry , you know , boxes of documents around , 
so , if i'm just going to be there working in the litigation center and doing , you know , odds and ends and stuff with the boxes of documents , i dress down . 
but if we're going to have a meeting , where we're having the attorneys come in , or uh , other party's attorneys and stuff , then i normally dress up . 
and i'll wear a dress and hose and stuff . 
you know , we're kind of that way too . 
i try to , 
i'm the same way you are , 
i kind of try to judge from day to day . 
i know , you know , where i am we work a lot with the customers 
and we have a lot of government folks come in all the time 
and if i know they're not , you know , 
i've been doing a lot of reorganization , you know , the last couple of months the same way you are , you know , 
and it's just impossible to crawl down on the floor and dig through boxes in a dress . 
that's right , 
it is 
and so , 
as a matter of fact , i thought i had one funny story 
when , uh , i was at t i the first year or so , we were sent out to our record retention facility to look through two thousand boxes . 
we had them in the warehouse , 
and at that point , the warehouse was over across the road 
and it wasn't air conditioned , 
and , we were there like in the middle of the summer , 
it's unairconditioned , 
it was dusty and dirty , uh , 
there was like a fan at the very end of the row 
and that was it . 
and so , we didn't really know we weren't supposed to , 
we thought t i dress code was just dress appropriate to your job , 
we wore shorts . 
we didn't know that was a big no , no . 
oh no . 
and the supervisor from another area came up to us 
and , you know , this area where record retention is , there's only a few people that work there , 
and he knew who worked there , 
he should have realized that we weren't regulars in the warehouse there . 
and he came up to us 
well he called our supervisor and our supervisor's supervisor , 
and it went up all the way to the head of facilities ,
oh no .
that could have alleviated a big problem . 
we ended up getting called out on it . 
oh , how awful . 
it sounds like mister power hungry . 
you know , just yesterday , though , i saw a girl in the  spine  out here at lewisville that had on a pair of shorts . 
and i don't care , 
you can call them split skirts 
and you can call them  culottes  all you want 
but these were shorts . 
that's all they were . 
i don't care what else you call them , you know , 
if they're below the knee , okay , 
maybe you can call them split skirts . 
if they're above the knee they turn into shorts , you know . 
and these weren't even really full ones . 
i mean they had a problem out here with it last summer , wearing these shorts that were , you know , the real wide full ones , you know , 
and these weren't even those . 
these were like pretty short , black , 
and they were very dressy , 
the were black velvet shorts 
and she had on black hose and black heels 
and she looked very , very nice . 
but , you don't wear shorts to work . 
you know , i mean ,   as far as i'm considered , she was in violation 
and nobody says anything to them . 
it's always been a big problem in lewisville in the summertime . 
you know , if they just , you know , 
the management doesn't ever seem to want to take an , cut off , you know , that no , 
this is wear we're going to draw the line . 
this is shorts , you know . 
and nobody will ever kind of take control and do that , you know , 
it sure would be cool and comfortable to wear , you know , 
well i've seen some people try to just come in like over the weekend because they want to use the texteller machine . 
and then during the week you see these women , in the you know , 
just because you put on a pair of hose with them doesn't make them not shorts anymore , you know . 
i mean i've never seen them do it without hose , 
i mean they always have hose on , 
but still , they're shorts , 
i don't care what you say , 
they're shorts . 
well i think t i's dress code is pretty lax considering everything , anyway , you know , uh . 
i didn't know that e d s has a very strict dress code , 
i had a friend , 
oh do they really ? 
i had a friend who worked there for a year or so 
and they spell it out . 
for men it's particular suits , uh , the pin stripe , and the particular colors of shirts and wing tipped shoes . 
oh , my god . 
oh , it is definitely lined out . 
women are not allowed to wear slacks , 
you wear coordinated suits . 
i couldn't afford to work there . 
and a particular kind of shoe , you know , so high heel , 
oh it is spelled out . 
oh , no . 
when i was looking at her materials when she first started , you know , she had her benefits package and all that kind of stuff . 
and it told about the dress code 
t i s says no shorts and no halters .
i know , that's it . 
and e d s is very particular about this , hair cuts , 
i mean it was like you can't have , you know , such and such facial hair , no beards , you know , and just really detailed . 
i don't know that that would be a good environment to work in . 
i mean , i see , 
i am more , 
i don't know about anybody else , 
and a lot of bosses may say i'm nuts , 
but i am more productive when i'm in pants . 
i am . 
i work faster , 
i get things done faster , than when i'm in a dress and heels , you know , 
and it's weird 
but i can get so much more done if i'm dressed comfortable , you know . 
well the time we were there at the warehouse we felt really bad because we had , uh , another person coming from washington , our outside counsel . 
and she was told that we were going to be in a warehouse 
but she really didn't get the idea that we were in the warehouse part of the warehouse not the office to the warehouse , but the warehouse . 
and she came with skirts , just like she'd be going into the office . 
we're out here in the warehouse , you know , 
you got your skid of , you know , that wooden pallet of boxes . 
and you're going to have in the boxes and then repack your skid . 
you can't do that in a skirt poor soul . 
oh yuck . 
she finally tried to go buy , you know , a pair of pants 
but , you know , i mean it was just completely miserable for her . 
that's terrible , 
well i don't know , 
i just figure , you know , yeah , 
sometimes i worry about , you know , if i go in in pants , 
and i never ever , ever , ever go in in a pair of jeans , you know . 
but i'll go in in pants . 
i mean today i had on a pair of , you know , navy blue dress slacks and , uh , like a peach colored top and , you know , not cruddy , but not a dress either . 
and sometimes i wonder if stuff like that you know , if upper management doesn't notice that and remember that later on , 
but , you know , i don't know if they do or not . 
you know , i see a lot of the managers 
and they're in jeans , 
so , you know . 
some of our people in the legal department , 
we have , um , assistants to the general counsel 
and it's funny 
because , there's one that always wears a suit . 
a matter of fact , he's never seen without his jacket to the suit on , buttoned . 
really , wow . 
and then there's another one who's a little younger and a little more  yuppish  
and he's always kind of like in the khaki pants and , you know , a shirt , 
and sometimes he wears the jacket to it . 
and some of the patent attorneys have been real casual in their clothes 
and then other ones tend to always wear a suit with a very starched cotton shirt . 
so that's just , 
isn't that funny . 
with you know , the little suspenders or something on 
that's great . 
but , i think a lot of times it's mainly who they're going to meet with , 
or they're meeting with people that they know is going to be dressed that way then that's how they are . 
if they're just going to be meeting with t i ers like to talk about a patent kind of thing and they're engineers that they're talking too , they dress kind of like how the engineers are dressed 
and they're usually casual . 
i mean that's the smart way to do it . 
it really is , because your making , you know , 
when they're meeting with the engineers who they know are going to be dressed down , if they come in , in , you know , a six hundred dollar three piece suit , it's going to make the people they're meeting with feel very uncomfortable , you know , 
or it would me , you know . 
it's one of those slippery attorneys coming in here . 
look at this slick guy , 
i wonder what kind of money does he make , 
i can see it now . 
well it was good to talk to you . 
it was really enjoyable . 
it really is . 
i've done some of the other speech programs , 
but we've never got to talk to another person , 
it was always just talking to the computer . 
oh , yuck , 
so this is a little different . 
well it's kind of enjoyable , 
i'm really looking forward to it . 
well thanks a lot . 
the question was , um , in public service . 
i think it would be a great idea . 
i'm not sure about requiring it , you know , of people , because people are going , you know , feeling resentful . 
i don't know , 
but i think it would be a great idea . 
seems like there's so many kids that don't have any since of , you know , what they want to be or do 
or , you know , they could learn something and maybe help other people at the same time 
and all countries sure need help 
 uh , would you be more in favor of , uh , you know , like a local , uh , 
my only experience with it , i was in central america for a while ,
for instance , everybody had what they called there social year ,
oh , really . 
and basically it was a , uh , repayment for , uh , high school education , 
and most of them joined the red cross 
and it was done internally . 
i just , 
there was very little external . 
i think possibly what , uh , they're thinking about here , more external peace corps ,
well , i think that would be real interesting for people to do , 
but , i guess , my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them , you know , to other countries , 
 but , i don't know . 
if you did it internally and it was just people in your own country then maybe countries that are so poor that they wouldn't be able to really , you know , send children to do that . 
i didn't know . 
i don't know how the peace corps works , 
i , guess i was of age when the peace corps came in ,
i was too . 
i thought seriously about joining at that time , 
i thought it was a fantastic idea . 
did you ever get any information on it like , 
i sent off for stuff on it , 
but i don't remember that much . about it . 
i know that they trained you in the language 
and , um , 
that's what i was wondering about was whether they actually , 
you actually got paid too , while in the peace corps , 
it wasn't much , 
but i guess , you could put some money aside while you were there , your expenses and , 
wasn't jimmy carter's mama that was in the peace corps ? 
but it might be interesting to see what would happen if you took kids and then took then to another country instead of having being exposed to all the drugs and violence and sex .
where they couldn't do that . 
you might end up with a revolution . 
i don't know which end though . 
that's been interesting , though , the kids that have been over , you know , coming back right now , you know . 
because from what i understand , from some of the guys i know , you know , crime , uh , is punishable , just almost , uh , instantly and 
public hanging . 
public hanging and this sort of thing , you know , 
so you don't have just a whole lot of ,
i've heard that like in china and stuff , there is virtually no such thing as rape , because if you rape somebody you'd be murdered , you know , on the , you know , street 
well , i guess that's , uh , the price of freedom , i guess , is a little , anyway , 
 the public service thing again 
i guess , in my own , having had the whole three or four minutes to , you know , give it a great deal of thought , you know , 
but when you do that then it becomes almost , uh , a    , 
or it can be , 
you know , there have , 
people will kind of set up their own little club , 
that's true . 
uh , but if , you know , 
people that might benefit most from it might not go in that situation , you know , like people that really are trapped in a ghetto or something like that . 
might not go if it was voluntary , 
but i don't know how they'd enforce it , 
if it was , 
well , if they went awol , what are you going to do . 
shoot them . 
put them in jail .
i don't know . 
send them over to iraq .
have a vacation in iraq for a year .
i know my dad always talked about , uh , 
he was in c c c during , uh , 
and he was , uh , a rock rib iowa type republican 
and the only good thing he could ever say about , uh , the whole roosevelt administration was , uh , civilian conservation corps , 
because he was in it . 
he thought that was great . 
the rest of it was all hog wash , 
but that was great . 
well , it seems like it would develop pride , you know , in people , if , it's in their own country . 
it would certainly help them to appreciate some of the things that we have here and develop some pride in them , if it was handled that way . 
it would take quite a few people . 
i think it might build jobs for people , you know , that were administrating and running and training and coordinating and all that , 
 so maybe that part of it would be helpful too . 
i don't know . 
the only , 
like to have a volunteer come here and rake leaves and mow the grass and  , 
well , you know that brings up the interesting subject too , you know , 
who would determine what these people do . 
you know , uh , you know , if it's run by the individual state . 
you know like c c c was run by the army 
and in effect , 
and the only opposition to it really was that it was , you know , starting some sort of a military elitist type , you know , special corps of cadre of people and that sort of thing . 
and , uh , when the politics get real confusing , 
really there could be , um , some scandals involved , if , you know , it wasn't people that were really fair and le , 
they could send all the people over to , uh , you know , one particular part of town or one particular project , that somebody had paid somebody to , you know , get supported , 
we've gotten to the point where , you know , well , if the racial make up of the group was such and such , you know , they'd have to do that percentage of work and what is perceived to be that part of town and , you know , 
oh , yeah . 
yeah . 
suppose , uh , well , you know , they had a group who were construction oriented 
and they went and they built , uh , can't think of a good example , a swimming pool , or anything , you know , 
and you can only build it in one place , you know , 
that's true . 
unfair or something , 
i think , uh , 
it's one of those things on the surface , you know , it seems like a great idea . 
it's like a joke i heard once about , uh , elephant foot soup , you know , 
it's easy to do once you find a elephant foot . 
it's , uh , the logistics of the thing that , uh , 
well , it seems like there's a lot , 
you don't hear much on the news about young people really , you know , wanting to do anything good or anything like that , 
but you know , i'm sure that there are a lot of young people out there that really do have good hearts and are willing to help and serve and that kind of thing . 
 uh , the little girl that used to be the littlest girl on the cosby show , kisha knight pullman , was starting a , 
i guess now she's practically a teenager , 
she started some type of , um , national organization for youth to volunteer to tutor other kids to read and , you know , do different service projects like that and trying to get youth more directed towards , you know , helpful things , 
and i know everyone like in the high schools in dallas , 
there's a couple high schools that have wanted to start like a , um , minority , you know , 
i think it was in a hispanic area , 
they wanted to start like a club for the teenagers , instead of , they said , all these gangs kids could join to belong . 
but they didn't have anything positive the kids could be doing , helping , you know , 
so they were trying to start that out , 
so if there's you know , kids that are willing to sacrifice their time and energy . gosh , we ought to use them .
it's just the , you know , 
here you are to the logistics of the thing again , you know . 
who's going to run it , you know , 
oh , it's just so many 
like i said at the beginning i've got so many connections with people in central america . 
my daughterinlaw is panamanian , you know , 
and they have situations like that down there .
if you want to go to school outside the country , and many salvadorians did , they'd go to school in cornell , iowa , of all places , 
and when they came back , they'd have to serve this year , 
and it turned out to be kind of a joke , 
the ones i knew , you know , always chose the red cross , because they didn't do anything 
oh , i see . 
 and they had all kinds of , uh , things they could go into , agricultural , and you know , 
but , uh , unless there was a flood or a fire or something like that , red cross , it was so many of them in it , that it was very slim . 
and so , 
well , we , um , belong to the church of jesus christ of latter day saints , which is like   the mormon church . 
and , um , there is men and also women , 
women aren't nearly as frequent , 
and also that have elderly couples once their kids have left , that can volunteer to go on a mission 
and , um , they're all over the world . 
and , its incredible logistics , 
i mean , they have a training center where they teach them , 
it's called the missionary training center in utah , 
and they have ,
and then they , um , you know , go and actually live in that country for the , uh , 
young men do it for two years and the young women for eighteen months . 
then that's , uh , kind of a private organization , 
you know , i'm familiar with , 
my instructor pilot was a mormon , 
instructor pilot because he considered himself indestructible , 
oh , yeah .
he had a direct connection somewhere , uh  , 
he felt that he really had an in 
but any rate that's off the subject , 
but , i , 
they don't get paid for it , 
um , but there is funding that comes , 
they're supposedly saving up on their own 
and the church helps them out some , 
but , you know , that it is incredible , you know . 
i see how they were organized in ,
and , uh , 
 um , i'm presently living in a house , uh , 
first time , uh , 
we had the house built 
and so this is our fifth year in it i guess , 
and , uh , um , it was a real excitement uh , to go out and select the house and have one made and built 
and like you wanted it , we were the fourth to build out of three hundred and forty houses . 
and , um , as we did with probably ninetyfive percent of the people here in dallasfort worth we bought a fox and jacobs home , 
and they're good for about five years or four years 
and after that they start falling apart . 
so , i would , uh , not recommend f and j house for my dog to live in , uh , because they're overpriced , uh , 
but they're a cheap house . 
if you can't afford something good , you know , 
they're good for that , 
and , um , you can call it a home because it's a place to go home and keep the rain off your head , 
but as far as the costs for what your getting , uh , the longevity of the house uh , is not worth it . 
how about in your case ? 
well , in my case my husband is not a carpenter , 
but , in fact , he's in electronics , 
but he knew the only way we'd ever have a new home is if he would build it . 
so it took him about two and a half years , 
but , uh , he built us a house , 
it's , uh , 
we have thirtytwo hundred square feet , 
and it's a brick house , 
and pricewise , it was great because he did it all himself , you know , 
so that way we could kind of control ,
and , uh , we live in kind of a small town , 
and i mean it's nothing fancy , you know , 
it's a house , 
it's nice , 
and it's real pretty 
and we're all comfortable in it . 
well , that's great , 
that's , uh , 
i've heard , 
i have another gentleman , friend of mine , uh , who had a house built 
as a matter of fact another guy is building one now , 
he's been doing it for three years 
and the city's a little upset with him , 
but i understand you save a lot of money off , uh , by doing that , 
and , uh , 
oh , you can because that way your not having to pay the middle men and everybody else . 
nothing wrong with that , 
you know . 
uh , i'll vouch for that . 
but , uh , of course , my husband did everything except 
my brother's a trim carpenter , 
and he came in , you know , and did the inside for us , 
and that helped . 
that was a big savings . 
and , uh , 
and , uh , we had to hire , of course , the plumbing and the brick and everything else , nothing , you know , 
well , that's great . 
 uh , have you been in it long ? 
oh , really , 
well , uh , our kids are kind of still small now , 
and we had thought before maybe a lot older we don't need such a large house that we'll sell it , 
but he will not build a second one himself .
 i see , 
first one is always a bear . 
we're having an architect friend of mine design a house for us 
and that can basically you know , 
so that's kind of ,
and he's charging us about a buck a square foot to design it 
and he's certified , and registered 
so it's not going to fall in or something if it's built . 
but , uh , i have heard that your approach is right , 
you can actually go out and sub it , even if you don't want to get hands on , 
you can even just sub it out to concrete and those kind of things 
 and that's kind of the plan i have 
everyone i talk to , uh , i file in my little book and do other things with it   .
that's great , 
that's great . 
but , uh , like i said otherwise , you know , the expense , 
but , you know , we could not have one as large as we have if , you know , we hadn't did it ourselves . 
i can imagine . 
i mean it's not an eldorado house or anything like that , 
but , you know , it's ours . 
if your happy with it , that's all that counts . 
that's right . 
that's all , 
you only have to , uh , satisfy yourself and no one else . 
apparently the appraisers likes it because our taxes sure is high .
oh , uh , that's , uh , an encouraging sign if you ever want to resell , i guess . 
isn't it ? 
it really is 
because i'm always shocked at about , you know , what they have it appraised at , 
  well that's great . 
well , yeah , 
i guess that about does it . 
and it was nice talking to you . 
nice talking with you , too . 
i think we're supposed to discuss our view of the soviet union as a continuing threat to the united states . 
how do you feel about that . 
i don't really , 
i more , 
i don't know about the government as much as , uh , 
the people , uh , i wouldn't consider to be a threat at all 
and i really don't feel much like the soviet union itself is a threat anymore . 
i'm worried about them . 
they're in a very , uh , tumultuous state right now with the kinds of , uh , adaptations that they're attempting to go through , uh . 
i'm concerned about them not as a military threat , but as a burden . 
they're very large 
 and they can become very quickly a large financial burden , as one more stepchild we have to carry around . 
i think that's a real important aspect 
and that , uh , as the mo , 
let's see , the more or that we can do to help them become selfsufficient is going to eliminate more of the risk of that becoming , uh , you know , a reality . 
i know that , uh , this last winter was very hard on , uh , several areas the ukraine , particularly the coal mining regions of siberia , uh , 
the people there have money , 
that's not their problem , 
but there's no food for them to buy , 
and its , 
you can't eat money . 
 and they have , their whole attitude , uh , 
i'm not sure which crop it was , 
but they had a crop that rotted in the fields because they couldn't get anyone to harvest it . 
they've got a lot of adjustments to make with coming out of what they've been through now , 
and , uh , under the oppression that they've been under for so long that now they have some freedoms 
but they don't know how to act yet . 
they don't understand that to make that work , 
they've got to take some responsibility for themselves . 
it's not just the government's responsibility anymore . 
you can't just blame it on the government when they give you the freedom to take care of yourself then that puts some responsibility on you as well . 
and i think that they're having a hard time with the concept of you can not go back . 
people only go forward 
and i think that that is giving them , 
i'm expecting a call 
and unfortunately , i think it's come through . 
i've enjoyed talking to you . 
thank you , 
all right , 
it was a catcher . 
and they really don't have an excess of catchers 
and it's really you know , to start , be trying to trade for somebody , especially with the salary cap that the rangers have . 
they're not the highest paying ball team around . 
oh no , 
but i would gladly take the salary of most of the guys , i'll tell you . 
oh , goodness , 
i would too , 
even the bench warmer , i would . 
that's right . 
i really haven't been an active ranger fan in several years . 
i used to go , take my son , you know , 
when he was in high school , he enjoyed going to baseball games . 
i'll have to admit did the rangers , 
uh , yeah . 
but , i think they're doing better . 
well , i do to , uh , 
i have boys , you know , like eight and eleven 
and we go quite often ,
i can imagine . 
i used to love to play baseball when i was a kid . 
oh yes , 
we're heavy into that too . 
i think it's more fun to play than it is to watch . 
oh , i do too . 
and i think , uh , what caught so many of our attentions last year was that nolan ryan , you know , 
oh of course , 
as a matter of fact i read in the sports page this morning , 
he just pitched his first , uh , exhibition game a day or so ago , 
and he pitched uh , yeah , five full innings . 
that was almost unheard of for a pitcher you know , to start out that strong . 
i know it , 
he's something else , 
he really is . 
he really is an , you know , 
as far as predictions and stuff , i really think the rangers may come out real strong this year . 
they could do very well , 
they sure could . 
they coul , because 
i don't know 
but last year i just figured they was under a lot of pressure because of all the publicity and everything , 
i really do . 
they've got , uh , i guess all , 
well all their players are signed now . 
some of them are not too happy about it 
but there's no hold outs . 
at least ,
so that should help . 
it sure should . 
it should , uhhuh . 
but in a way , i really do , 
and of course , there's a few more , you know , i think are good ball teams also . 
oh yeah , 
like oakland a's and the giants 
there sure are . 
i like to go watch the giants when they come to houston some times . 
that's right . 
but , uh , 
i've never seen the astros play . 
oh you haven't ? 
oh , i have a few times . 
uh , they're a good ball team . 
that's right . 
they really are . 
they sure are . 
wouldn't it be something to have a world series between the rangers and the astros . 
oh , wouldn't it though .
i tell you that would draw a crowd , wouldn't it . 
it sure would . 
wouldn't that be something . 
oh , yeah . 
it sure would . 
that's something you dream about . 
but there are a lot of ranger fans around . 
oh , there sure is 
and , uh , i mean they really are . 
uh , now  incavalia  i don't know how familiar you are with him 
but , last year i was kind of thinking he sure did get in a slump . 
but they're saying this year , their predictions is that he's really going to come out of it and ,
isn't he though , 
he really is gosh . 
he sure is . 
he either hits home run or strike out . 
that's right . 
there is not ever a in between for him . 
that's right , 
it's kind of like babe ruth . 
they were saying something about this may be his last year with the rangers though . 
apparently i think his contract is up after the end of this year 
and they're not sure they're going to be able to sign him again . 
that , you know , may or may not happen . 
oh you never know . 
that's right , 
it's a long way away . 
that's sure ri , 
if you offer them money , i'm sure they'll , 
that's right . 
that's right , 
unfortunately the rangers don't spread it around quite as big as some of the other teams do . 
no , like that  joe hosago   , you know . 
that's right . 
i mean , oh . 
is there going to be a ticket increase this year , price , do you know . 
i hadn't heard . 
i haven't either , 
i really haven't , uh , 
 uh , those cowboys have increased their prices again this year . 
oh yeah . 
but i didn't know , 
i don't think i've heard anything on the rangers , 
or i don't remember it if i have . 
well i hadn't either , 
we hadn't , you know , 
like i said , we , 
i don't even guess they've even thought about sending the schedules out yet . 
i guess it's too early . 
because we usually get one . 
we usually order our tickets way in advance . 
it's a good idea , 
we try to go so often . 
if you have they get a kick out of it . 
oh , they do . 
well , i've enjoyed talking to you . 
well you too  lori  .
and , hopefully we'll get to talk again . 
you take care . 
what is , 
do you have a favorite recipe ? 
um , yeah , 
um , this is strange because i pressed one and i thought it said begin . 
maybe we're all set . 
we'll talk for five minutes , 
they interrupt at the end . 
um , yeah , 
i just happen to plan one out for saturday 
i'll tell you ,
oh , that's wonderful . 
well , i have this new fondue pot 
and i was going to do basic cheese fondue , 
and i have two different kinds of breads and some ham 
and i was going to try something weird which , you know , 
 when you have  fish au gratin , 
i was going to make some , uh , like fish chunks and dip it in the fondue . 
i don't know if it will come out . 
some people like swiss , um , 
i prefer cheddar . 
and i'll mix , 
for fondue i think it should be a little calmer than real sharp ,
and then i was going to make other things like potato skins . 
oh , that sounds good . 
see you don't necessarily have to dip this stuff . 
and , um , i was going to have broccoli and cauliflower for a vegetable . 
that's always a good thing . 
vegetable trays always go over so well , because i think people get tired of eating junk . 
i mean , i think they like to have healthy stuff too , 
you know it's , 
oh , yeah , 
it's amazing how vegetables trays will go at a party . 
oh , definitely . 
i think better even than other kinds of food .
instead of something greasy or , 
  my , uh , girlfriends do catering 
and always , about every party they do is  they  have a vegetable tray . 
i think they try and suggest it . 
what i've been doing when i get invited someplace and bring something , i make , uh , food kabobs . 
you take little toothpicks and cut up ,
it stays nice and fresh . 
that's true . 
or even have you ever seen where they'll take a watermelon and just cut the top out of it and then hollow that out ,
i like those .
um , they made a couple of those , uh , 
they made one for my , uh , bridal shower 
and  i was  pretty pleased . 
i never made one for myself though . 
but they look easy enough to make 
it's not , 
oh , i think it would be a lot of work 
you have to cut each thing or , you know , use the melon baller and stuff 
 but i think they're really neat 
and , you know , i think they're worth the time , you know , because they , 
you probably pretty sticky after you get done . 
oh , yeah 
then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because , you know , when you scrape it , it makes the water . 
um , something i do  is a  fruit , 
 um , make chocolate sauce and dip strawberries and bananas in them . 
i have two nieces 
go buy me some strawberries . 
is that good ? 
you know , i've seen that so many times , strawberries dipped in chocolate 
but i've never tried it , 
are they really good ? 
but if you get a sour strawberry , 
huh . yeah , 
 um , the strawberries are coming in season now  from   , 
they're coming up from florida , of course . 
i live in vermont , 
but they're really reasonably priced , 
they're coming up from florida , 
oh , well , that's good 
because i know they've been really expensive lately .
of course , they had to be , uh , grown in greenhouses and stuff  and in   , 
 uh , actually i think they get , um , some of them from south america . 
oh , is that right ? 
a lot um , of a , um , winter produce comes from south america . 
oh , i   .
of course , their seasons are switched . 
so , um , do you want to discuss the recipe ? 
um ,  it filled   , 
a lot of people try to stay away from this 
but i make my own homemade pudding just because i don't like box pudding . 
is that right ? 
i've never heard of that . 
 and it   if you , um , well , 
 first of all  i   take about a quarter and a half of milk 
and i put it in a two quart saucepan 
and you put it on a really low heat . 
and you want to use one of your good sauce pans that dissipate the heat because it ends up burning , 
i mean , no matter how careful you are you still might get a film on the bottom of the pot . 
i  don't  let that worry me . 
and i get the  milk  lukewarm 
and then i pour about a half a cup of cornstarch in it 
and i have this thing 
it's called the slender blender , 
uh , it makes , uh , a whip topping out of milk if you get the milk cold enough . 
it's , uh , i don't know , 
they're called  moo goo leaves  or something 
they're sl , 
i think i know what you're talk , 
is it like a hand held ? 
they're real neat . 
i think they're real reasonably priced , 
some of them , they used to be a hundred dollars  , 
and they used to whip skim milk into a dessert 
but i didn't get that one , 
i got the black and decker kind . 
but , uh , it's real handy because it doesn't have a cord 
and you beat this cornstarch right into the milk , you know , 
and it does an excellent job , 
or just hand beat it . 
i guess you could use a hand mixer 
but i don't think it gets it good enough . 
and then before the milk gets too hot , um , i add two beaten eggs and i really mix them in good . and then about a half a cup of sugar 
and i let it pretty much , 
i beat it like every minute for about ten seconds 
and it starts thickening , 
when it thickens the cornstarch might get a little , i don't know , 
it gets like little globs of this rubbery cornstarch , 
and you just keep beating it in . 
and it's the , 
the trick is to have this blender , 
so , if you were , 
you'd have to probably almost go out 
and   someone who's just going to make it first time , it's , 
you'll have much better luck if you had one of these little blenders . 
and then you can add cocoa powder to it to make chocolate 
or after it's thickened i cook it for a good , 
once it starts boiling , i cook it for a good seven minutes , 
and then you can make chocolate 
or you can take it off and let it cool   
you put , um , really good vanilla favoring in it and some butter 
and that makes french vanilla , um , custard . 
oh , wow . 
that is really interesting . 
are you saying to use like , um , for chocolate like , unsweetened , 
a chocolate powder . 
it comes in like a real dark can , 
our mothers used to use it . 
and then , 
i have some .
we all used to , 
i just want to , 
  , it's the unsweetened kind 
it's not like nestles quik . 
i suppose you could use that . 
cooking chocolate . 
but , um , 
that's really interesting , 
i've never heard of anybody making their own pudding before that's really neat . 
well , i used to make the regular pudding , the chocolate and put it in the pie shell 
and if it would sit in the refrigerator for a day , where you cut the pie , it would soak into the pie shell 
and it was like red , 
and i'm like , oh , 
this is kind of  groedy  .
well , how did you get a recipe for pudding on your own ? 
um , actually i found it in one of my mother's , um , homemade cookbooks , 
i mean , 
is that right ? 
oh , neat , 
that is just really neat . 
because i , 
i think you couldn't make it with a hand whisk or a regular beater 
but , um , 
it would probably be a lot more work and probably not turn out as good . 
the trick is to get the cornstarch , 
um ,  yeah 
  , right in the lukewarm milk . 
sometimes  i  put the cornstarch in a separate bowl 
and i would put it in the sink 
and i'll take my lukewarm milk and put it in the cornstarch and beat it good . 
it seems to be better than putting the cornstarch into the liquid 
once it hits the top of the liquid it seems to make little balls and stuff on the top . 
so you put the milk in the cornstarch ? 
and i'll do this , uh , 
sometimes   i'll  put  my  after i  pour that back into my saucepan . 
i'll put the eggs in the same dish and beat them up and then pour the cornstarch and the milk mixture in the egg . 
and then put that back in the saucepan ? 
and then , you know , if you can put your cocoa in with your cornstarch if you wanted to . the cocoa even seems to thicken it even more . 
huh that's , 
because  by  the vanilla doesn't seem to thicken as well as the , 
sometimes the cocoa is 
like , my husband really likes it thick 
when you cook a package ,
but i put it in a nice glass bowl 
and , um , some people don't like that , film on the pudding 
so you can put , uh , saran wrap over the top . 
and then once the pudding starts cooling it makes little balls of water on the saran wrap , 
so , when you pull the saran wrap back , you sort of should be a little careful , pull it back and shake the water off the saran wrap 
and i might put it back on . 
but , um , 
do you put it in the refrigerator then 
or y , 
but , um , i , 
my father always told me if you put hot food in your refrigerator you're going to make it work too hard . 
that's true . 
i knew that . 
 that's   , 
so ,  , that's why i do that . 
so , well , i don't know 
that's my great hard recipe . 
have you ever served as a juror ? 
i never have either . 
you haven't , huh . 
if you were , uh , what do you think about the whole concept of a trial by your peers ? 
well , i think it's a good idea . 
i think our justice system needs a major overhaul , 
and i'm not sure what needs to be done to fix it . 
but i think they've got a lot of problems . 
i think the major thing they need to correct is how long it takes something to get to jury , and to get to trial . 
and i don't know if that's just a pure volumes number or what , 
but , uh . sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined , 
and they're too easily swayed by their emotion . 
i think that's true . 
hence is possible error as you can see in all the ironsides ,
would you prefer all trials by a judge ? 
but as far as the to award , you know . 
two point two million dollar kind of settlement versus a judge knowing , you know , it's true that , you know , this may be sad and all that thing , 
but , uh , the jury i think is best , in most cases , suited for determination of guilt and innocence , but not the award of penalties and fines and punishment . 
i would agree with that . 
i think you're righ , 
i think they sometimes get carried away by the circumstances and make huge settlements thinking well it's only going to cost the insurance company , 
that's true . 
but , uh , i do like the idea of the jury being the people who decide in the matter of , uh , if it's a jail term versus life and death 
if they give them all the information . 
i don't know , 
when it comes to sentencing phase , i guess they tell them if the person has a previous record and stuff . 
sometimes it seems like during the trial part , the jury's you know , misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave , 
uh , it's kind of difficult , 
and i guess the whole system is set up to rather let , uh , some guilty people go free than to put an innocent person in jail 
do you think the verdict should be completely unanimous by the jury ? 
um , i don't know . 
 you know , i heard a very interesting , 
and maybe it's just the t v show or movie i was watching , 
they were going through a trial , 
and i think it was like on one of the verdict by the jury 
 and they went by each one , saying guilty or innocent , guilty or innocent . 
and they took it more as just like a majority . 
so i , 
some of them disagree , 
i mean , some of them said one way and some the other . 
but they took , you know , whatever the majority was . 
so i didn't know if that was just something for drama or that's truly the way it is . 
i always thought it had to be unanimous . 
i think it does have to be unanimous . 
but , uh . rather interesting . 
i know they can poll a jury , make sure everybody agrees with what they said the verdict was , 
but i thought that they all had to agree 
or else it was a hung jury . 
i did also . 
i don't know how i feel about that . 
i think maybe , uh , majority might be sufficient . 
it's hard to say though . 
what about in international trials . 
do you think they should have a jury there ? 
i think that would be kind of interesting . 
i hadn't thought about international trials at all . 
i guess the problem with that is there's no true authority in any kind of international verdicts 
well , whose going to really make them . 
 but i think it would be kind of interesting to incorporate that concept of , you know , people from different countries , uh , in as international law also . 
i think maybe they'd need to be more knowledgeable though than just your average joe off the street 
i don't know come up with a true perfect system , or if one exists . 
and it's already ,   some chart and determine the punishment , 
it's not a discretionary thing . 
i think there should be a core minimum that they get 
 but , uh , i guess there should be some flexibility because every situation may be unique , that the judge can either increase that or keep it just at its minimum , things of that nature . 
i wish that when they sentence someone , if they're going to sentence him to five years , then make him serve five years . 
that serves a kind of if they're , i guess , uh , 
if you sentence someone to life , life is only fortynine years , something like that . 
and i guess you're eligible after twentyseven for parole , even though you're in for life . 
and sometimes those people are young enough , they can still get out and cause a lot of trouble . 
although i guess it's , you want them to rehabilitate and become better rather than sitting in there and being a drain all the time . 
i don't believe that very often happens . 
because uh , inside the jail i don't think there's no real rehabilitation . 
i don't think so either . 
in fact , i think they end up worse , because the conditions are so bad . 
it's another war zone . 
but , who knows . 
some kind of real punishment , like hard labor for a shorter length of time , you know . 
i agree , 
get them out there , 
actually make them do something that's not pleasant and do it and get it over with and get back in the , you know , world and not spend so much time sitting around , letting the bad influences of the other ones rub off on them , 
they should have them go out and doing stuff .
since the state is paying for them , they should get some kind of work out of them . 
something besides license plates and tiddlywinks . 
trading their lives for cigarettes 
well good . 
well , i think that covers it . 
i think so . 
nice talking to you . 
nice talking to you also . 
have a wonderful easter . 
you , too . 
well , how many credit cards do you have ? 
um , i've got about four maybe . 
i try to limit them because i don't use them too much . 
and i use my visa just for about everything , 
and i pay it all off . 
so i try not to , 
i just use it for free money for thirty days basically . 
sounds like we have no conflict . 
we had , 
for a while i was carrying one card 
and my wife was carrying a different one . 
and since the slips all look alike , uh , you commingle them 
and then you get the statement 
and you try to sort them out , uh , 
and uh , it caused more confusion about it . 
and then when a t and t came along and offered a free one , uh , i accepted that , 
and we've been using that one . 
uh , the interesting thing can run up on them . 
i don't know , 
do you know any people that run up big bills ? 
you know , i'm in the age group you get out of college , 
and i think a lot of these people have them maxed out . 
well , um , were you able to get one while you're in college ? 
just curious , because i have a son that's a senior this year , 
and he's heading off , with any kind of luck , 
but there has been , 
i've had a couple of ads to provide a card for a college student . 
uh , what do you think about the idea of providing one for somebody like that ? 
i , you know , 
it's , you know , feasible , 
i mean , i know a lot of college kids you know , who had them , but just depends . 
well , from the card issuer , uh , that 
 the parent gets it for them , that really the parent becomes the one that's responsible , 
but it's , 
so basically if you want to take the risk .
it's whether the parent wants to take the risk . 
it's your risk , 
do you trust , your son , 
to go run up a big bill 
and , the thing is , there some advantages , if he got off 
 i'm leaning towards doing it 
i'd say , you know , have one with , you know 
and the idea that , you know , if he got in trouble , there's some ways of getting out , and that he doesn't have to carry cash . 
the , uh , 
and , uh , i don't even carry checks around . 
i let my wife take the checkbook , 
and she writes the checks , 
and i record them . 
so on credit cards , 
and , uh , i had recently had some dealings with a fellow that 
he was making , oh , considered a modest salary for an engineer , 
and he had run up , uh , more than a years salary in various debts to , 
and he wound up declaring bankruptcy 
but there , 
it's hard to believe that you'd run up twenty , thirty thousand dollars of , uh , 
well , it was a combination of things 
there were several credit cards , 
and then there were several other businesses , 
the extended loan payment for your car . 
the interesting thing about that incur more debt , 
well , it's business , 
and they're making money off that . 
and they make more money if you extend your loan . 
so it's business , 
they're only going to do it to like cars that are one or two years old . 
and so they've already shifted the risk . 
if they assume that car , then they just have to sell it themselves , 
and they'll recover the loan , 
  they're not going to keep on if the car were older . 
the interesting thing about it or in economics , 
to carry all that consumer debt 
so . it's interesting that the american public is encouraged to incur all that debt and then next year none of it will be deductible , 
and this year it's ten percent or so . 
that , uh , they encourage us to do things , 
 now what's ten percent , we can deduct , 
i think ten percent , 
i didn't know that . 
of your consumer credit . 
oh , if you had a thousand dollars , that means there's another hundred dollar deduction i've given you . 
i didn't think you could , 
any thing on or , 
on the , 
there's a place for consumer debt 
and then you take ten percent of it , 
on the , 
oh , i've never itemized yet . 
oh , okay , 
so maybe that's .
it's on um , 
well , it's the same place you put , uh , interest . 
a second mortgage , like some states where you can take out the mortgage and declare that , 
and so , uh , it's fully deductible . 
the laws are a little squirrelly , 
but it basically comes down to 
it's not in your best interest to borrow money from a tax standpoint . 
but , uh , anyway , 
i just try to stay out of debt , 
for as much as i can , 
and i pay it all off , 
sounds like very financially responsible . 
there're a lot of people who really run , 
my boss drives quite a ways to work , 
and he's got just enormous debts , 
and he's , 
well , he's and this kind of thing , 
and that 
 i think that the whole credit card issue , i think they certainly encourage people to run up the debts 
but i agree with you 
 i   my debts . 
well , i did buy a new house last summer . 
hell , i took a five year note out on my car right when i got out of college , 
and , uh , i'll never do that again . 
i still got a couple of years on it to go , 
and i'm , 
it's remarkable how many people as soon as they get out of college buy a new car , 
and uh , apparently that's been going on for a really long time . 
i didn't do it . 
i bought a second hand car when i was , the middle of my senior year . 
well , you think you're starting out well , until you start paying all those bills .
miscellaneous things like food and 
these habits you get into , eating 
what you learn . 
well , anything else good to say about credit cards ? 
i might just , 
 you know , they're convenient , you know , 
that's probably one big thing about them , 
and , uh , 
you don't have to carry the cash , 
the places , you know , 
it's hard to cash a check if you're out of state , 
well , i was used to using my credit card , like at skaggs alpha beta in dallas , and stuff 
 and now i'm out here in phoenix . 
they don't do tha , 
none of these grocery stores take any credit cards , 
so now i have to carry cash when i go to the grocery store , which is new to me , you know , 
i got to have sixty bucks on me or something . 
so , uh 
carry all that cash with you . 
well , you know they 
have you seen the debit cards where they actually debit your account when you , 
and i think that's where , 
that's mostly locally , 
the banks will line up with , uh . 
i've seen a couple , 
although the , 
so many of the grocery stores don't do that because of the time frame which they get paid , in general , 
that , uh , 
i've seen checks i mean , cleared my account the next day . 
my wife will write a check for groceries 
and , you know , almost , 
well i guess it's the day after , uh , 
technically it's two days , 
but they took that check and scurried it to the bank 
and the bank scurried it back to my account , 
and you thought there'd be just a little bit of float , 
but apparently that's why uh , the , uh , grocery stores are reluctant to do that , because their volume , that is quite high , 
and they have , uh , 
the costability of the cash flow is a big issue for them . 
well , it's good talking to you . 
all righty . 
maybe we'll cross paths again . 
good night . 
all righty . 
take it easy . 
so what kind of weather have you had in dallas ? .
well , it's been very windy , 
see , i don't , 
 uh , i thought , 
i lived in euless 
and i thought it was pretty normal , 
anyway , but i guess you're right though it has been real hot , 
because it , um , 
i've had to use the air conditioner in march , 
we've already had to use that , 
 my husband  usually , 
and we've had like , 
i mean , this is probably typical though , uh , we , 
like tornado weather and tornado warnings , 
and , uh ,  , 
so , uh , you know , i forget from year to year . 
i'm getting too old . 
but , uh , 
but i guess , you know , we're just out of march , and , uh 
i know , 
the trees are real pretty right now and everything . 
and , uh , i don't know . 
i know the pollen is real high , 
seems very high . 
it hasn't bothered me , 
but i know that people that have allergies it seems to be pretty high . 
i know . 
it's been bothering me a lot , 
like you said , probably a little bit warm 
so we basically live in the same area 
so it's real hard to , 
i know . 
i just think it's been warm , 
and it's been hot , 
and i liked it , 
and it's beautiful , 
and all the trees are pretty , 
and i wish it would stay like this all the time .
i could stand this all summer . 
so yeah , 
i could too . 
and , uh , gah , i don't think we can say anything else really . 
i don't think we can either , 
let's cut off . 
that sounds like a good deal . 
well , you have a nice day . 
you too . 
 and we'll talk to you later . 
let's talk about the middle east situation . 
the u s involvement in there , then i guess even though . 
now it's all over with , you know . 
well , it is over 
but i don't think we're out of there by any means , 
and uh , i wonder are we going to set up you know peace keeping type forces for long term . 
you know , is that something we should do or shouldn't do ? 
i don't know . 
i understand that the u s is talking about leaving more of its planes and things over there . 
uh , i guess , uh , they're anti u s in that region 
and now they're , you know , 
like syria and egypt , you know had some pressure against the u s , 
but now they wouldn't allow us to have a base in that region 
but now i think they are rethinking that . 
i think that's true because of all the support that came through . 
that's right . 
the other thing that i think is good for like american businesses are to be involved is the reports that i hear back 
and of course on the news i try to listen and also read between the lines you know .
but , they said that because the americans you know took such a proactive stance involvement in the war that 
like so much of the business and the rebuilding in kuwait and things like that will go to american businesses where as before they may be dealt with japanese firms or other people . 
they said even though the japanese were involved monetarily , uh , they still 
like the you know which will be good for our economy . 
but , i , you know . 
they get so much of our money from oil anyway .
don't you know , 
i mean we don't seem to slow down even when there is a crisis .
i think that's a nice gesture , on the kuwaiti government part to do that , 
and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth . 
i imagine . 
your oil companies , they may see ,
go over there and rebuild all those . 
i think it's such a shame that the iraqis had to just go destroy everything . 
i just . 
i do too . 
i mean , what good is that ? 
if i can't have it , you can't have it , you know 
that sounds like something a little kid would do . you know . 
but look at their war , 
that was his whole war 
i'm not satisfied with what iraq has , 
i want what everybody has . 
that's right . 
and you're right , 
it's like you see two little preschool kids fighting over a toy , you know . 
i am a little concerned about you know , 
i know they are putting president bush right now in an awkward position concerning the , 
you know what am i trying to say ? 
but , uh , you know the ceasefire , 
i'm trying to say another , yeah . 
we're not the judge and jury . 
to help out . 
so i think he's in a pretty awkward position now 
and i think we ought to help , you know . 
maybe supply some arms or something . 
supply arms and support them if they need help 
but i don't think we ought to be over there fighting it for them , 
 and , so i think he's done good on that stance . 
i think bush has handled this whole situation quite well . 
he stood up to the bully and ,
 uh , and uh , saddam hussein miscalculated all along ,
i would say . 
that's right . 
and , uh , then he underestimated his ability to wage a war with us . 
and that was a horrible miscalculation . 
i agree , 
you know they'd advertised and said in the news and said he had the fifth largest army . 
well , he may have 
but you , 
not any more .
but , you have to have loyalty , 
you have to have people who believe in your cause . 
you know , i know they tried to turn it into a holy war , because to them that is what's honorable . you know , 
but i think they are smart enough ,
we just want to go in and took it . 
you know . 
saddam hussein is not a religious person , 
but he uses it .
 uh , and i think the people were smart enough to realize that , 
and i think they're afraid of him . is what they are . 
the population is afraid to speak out against him 
and i don't think he's going to be there too much longer . 
well , i hope that's true . 
someone is going to assassinate him , you know . 
i would think so , 
i guess in the back of my mind i think like maybe the israeli massad probably has ideas of going in and , huh . 
you know , i thought they , uh , showed a tremendous restraint in their reactions towards everything , 
but i don't believe for a minute that that means that they don't have ideas and plans of their own .
that's right . 
but i do agree with you , 
i think president bush handled it all politically very smart , you know , giving the support of the other arabs and other nations in the world 
and i think , that's how you have to go into something like that . 
i've heard reports that president bush was staking his future on uh , this war and that setting a precedent saying that this league of nations will always combine against bullies and to stop this kind of stuff in the world . 
any would be bully would think twice if he knew that , you know , 
there's this united nations or world government or whatever they keep talking about that the whole world will deal with you . 
and you just can't do it and get away with it , you know , hoping that you know , 
that's right . 
because it's a world thing 
and the nations will combine against you 
and you know , you can't just do this . 
and don't you think that long term that's been a big boost for the united nations . 
oh , yeah . 
i mean the united nations been there for years , but all of a sudden . 
had no teeth . 
there are some teeth behind it 
and the fact that when they have sanctions and we support things like this , it means something . 
and i think that's good for the strength of the united nations . 
i guess , i feel sorry for just the average , you know , iraqi ,
and rebuild from nothing . 
living conditions must be terrible . 
and it's not getting any better , 
the sanctions are still on . 
that's true . 
you know , except for a few medical supplies they are allowing through now and then powdered milk , i guess , for babies and things 
and until they , 
i guess , yesterday they came out with these rules i guess or whatever .
they supported it . 
that is right , 
but that's only fair . 
they did ask that they build up israel and kuwait . 
and i think they should have to . 
they lost .
it's going to be really tough for them to swallow , 
but we don't want a kuwait there you know , just has no power at all , 
and that you know , 
because iran still isn't too friendly with them . 
well , that's true . 
well i don't think iran is under the same type of madman type leadership , 
but there's always the possibility , i guess . 
since khomeini died over there , things have gotten a little more normalized . 
i think so . 
not quite as radical a stance , more moderates are in power now . 
i think the person who really may be at this time has a hard road to tow is jordan's king hussein because he really kind of , 
put in the middle . 
you know , he wasn't necessarily for iraq 
but at the same time , he didn't feel like everybody ought to be going against iraq . 
and yet so many of the citizens are uh , the lebanese .
and there really was no connection at all . 
i know , 
isn't that amazing the way that they will find their cause 
no matter what situation they see they're going to find their cause whether it truly exists or not . 
but one thing i did learn was how deep the hatred runs toward israel by a lot of countries . 
i know . 
they just hate , 
i mean , anyway you know , they can see to connect into something and hate it more , 
i mean , they just , 
i understand most of the land is now israelis , 
they bought ,
that's true . 
but , see you are also getting back to the ages old problem of arabisraeli conflict ,
and theirs tie so much to their religion . 
and they both have holy sanctions . 
so , very different things than what we face . 
well , uh , the main change in ? 
what generation are you , 
i'm thirty years old ? 
i'm twentynine . 
you're twentynine , 
 so we're both children of the very early sixties . 
and , i mean i've seen some change , 
like i know , um , when i was young most mothers pretty much were housewives ,
um , um . 
and the woman is working and , 
or maybe they work parttime or something . 
so , that seems to be a pretty big change . 
the family structure in general is being really restructured from one income to two incomes which means from one parent to two parttime parents ,
um , i , uh , 
it's funny , 
it's both of us then were really just adolescents when , 
i think , most of the major changes for adult women were going on ,
i don't think , changes are still progressing , 
but it seems to me that the early seventies was a period of the most change , 
and , if i had to somewhat abstract about it , it seems to be the major change has been that woman have acquired more choice . 
oh , that's true . 
uh , i mean , that's sort of the meta change as it were . uh , where that woman really have more of a choice now about what they do . 
uh , course , they find that the choice creates its own hardships in a way because life is not quite as simple even if it is for your , you know , 
you can share something you really want , which is a wonderful thing , 
but , it does seem 
like an awful lot of some of these choices . 
well , i know , the choice to either work or to be a mother is probably pretty difficult because i think women just naturally tend to have those instincts that you know , you protected the children ,
and it's kind of almost expected of you anyway . 
people kind of look down you know , the role of a woman as a housewife , 
she just settled for that . 
even though there's probably women with m b a's , maybe even ph d's , that are staying at home with the children . 
well , i only know , 
i have , 
of my friends who have children , uh , 
i only know of one woman who's decided to go that quote , unquote , traditional route . 
and , i have a lot of respect for her , because she made it as a real choice . 
she really knew that she didn't have to do that , 
but she decided that was what she wanted to do in her life . 
and , she wanted that role . 
she's a marvelous parent 
and you know , i say all power to her because she's an example to me of someone who really does have the choice . 
i feel that a lot of , uh , women don't , 
all right i said they have the choice 
but they don't necessarily feel that they do because they no longer feel like if they were just to be a parent rather than , uh , you know , a sort of super woman success in the business world as well ,
and then it's not a choice anymore . 
uh , and frankly , it's the way that men are . 
uh , men don't have this choice , 
they don't feel this choice . 
so , it's , um , 
there's some t v show on now 
and i think i've seen it once . 
i don't get to watch much t v , 
but , uh , there's a t v show where the man is the one raising the kids ,
and i , 
maybe they based it on that mister mom movie , 
i didn't happen to see that . 
i guess they're trying to gain more public acceptance of things like that . 
because i know there are cases of where that happens 
oh , yeah . 
i knew people who did that years ago , 
but they were very apologetic about it 
it's probably getting more and more accepted today , 
in fact it seems like it's kind of like anything goes now , 
you're not too surprised on much of anything . 
when , you know , the husband's the one at home raising the children ,
that's not real surprising . 
i've seen more and more companies that have , uh , parental leave , not just maternity leave . 
they can have paternity leave , as well as maternity leave . 
in fact i'm pretty sure ti has something like that 
because , uh , one of the area supervisors , uh , in my area , as a matter of fact , took off , um , for a couple of weeks , when his wife had their baby . 
now it might have been just to take care of her and the baby ,
but , i don't know if he took that out of his vacation or if they really do have a paternity , 
he put paternity leave up there , 
but it might have just been him describing the fact that he was taking vacation days to go be a father for a little while , 
i don't know . 
but , i'm not real sure how that goes . 
the other big change i see in woman's lives is , um , to remain biological 
are having children much later in life . 
uh , i mean , my friends who are having children are having them at age thirty . 
and , uh , if i'd been a couple of generations ago , they would have had kids running around by then . 
well , people they , in general , are just getting married a lot later . 
i'm still single 
so i'm sure i'll be to ever getting married and having kids . 
 i think that's getting a little more common too . 
i actually think that i'm somewhat encouraged by that trend , because after all people live longer lives now ,
and , i think , most people make better parents when they are a little bit more mature . 
i really do . 
i think it also gives a woman a chance , if she does have a job and a career , 
it gives the man and the wife both the chance to both be working and maybe save up some money 
and then it gives her a little more option if she wants to stay home with the children while they're young ,
and then once they've gotten to school age maybe she could go back to work . 
so , she's kind of got that option ,
it's not as difficult for her to stay at home with the kids and live off one income , or something . 
that's true . 
so , i guess , i'm pretty encouraged .
i really am . 
but , then i'm a product of my generation , 
i don't know , if i had been born a hundred years ago and were looking at this time , i might not like it , 
but it sure seems nice to me . 
uh , i mean , i have other things to complain about , 
but in terms of , uh , woman's roles ,
i seem to see more women uh , in leadership type roles and management positions ,
i mean , it's still , 
but it's , 
it really is . 
like the mayor of dallas is a woman . 
oh , really! 
and , i'm sure that twenty years ago that never would have happened , 
i think , she's in her second term now . 
so , she's , 
this is her second term , 
i think , she's uh , 
but , uh , we do , and we have several council women that are women , 
in fact , oh , the governor of texas is a woman , too .
we can't forget that one . 
what's her name ? 
ann richards . 
we don't get much texas politics out in california , to be honest . 
she was inaugurated in january , 
and i know when i was younger it was all the presidents , and still all the presidents are men , 
but i'm sure that one of these days , well look at ferraro ran for vicepresident , 
that's right 
although during the presidential debates , there was some really nasty patronizing ,
i don't know if you saw those , 
but , i thought she was treated badly for being a woman ,
and , uh , it was acceptable to say certain types of things to her that she couldn't say back ,
but , really , that's a previous generation . 
i don't , 
it's harder to imagine people of our age doing that ,
i agree . 
i've enjoyed talking with you . 
it was nice talking to you , too . 
take care . 
you , too . 
bye , bye . 
bye , bye . 
well , how do you feel about , uh , drug testing ? 
um , personally , i don't have a problem with it , uh , 
i think , uh , as far as , uh , protecting fellow employees , protecting their reputation of the company and the quality of work that the people do , um , it's justified . 
on the other hand , um , i do agree that it's an invasion of privacy as far as a person's involvement outside of work . 
um , i would never have a problem with anyone testing me , 
but i can understand why people would object . 
so , uh , i guess , uh , i'm kind of mixed on it ,
i am too a little bit , 
i mean , i don't want to be around people who are really on drugs and that sort of thing , 
and , you know , obviously they're probably not going to be doing a good job and so forth , 
but i don't really like having to do it . 
that's right . 
and i don't like the idea of it , makes too much of a big brother type of thing . 
that's absolutely right . 
outside activities affect your work 
and , uh , uh , granted , you know , that , 
on company property and whatnot ,
uh , uh , i don't think anybody would ever argue that .
but , um , you know , if i don't , uh , see any results of it the next day . 
i think so too . 
but , you know , it's one of those things . 
well , it , you know , 
on the other hand uh , the possibility of people , oh , 
you've got some people could be arrested for , uh , drug use , drug dealings and things like that , 
and , uh , it's , 
the company and , uh , you know , what kind of people work there , what , uh , 
 plus , i guess , if they are in problem enough to be jailed or something of that nature for any length of time , then the company has lost what they've put into that employee ,
that's right . 
even if it is , you know , a company policy of , uh , immediate termination or whatever , they still have to replace them . 
and , uh , there's a lot involved there . 
well , do you think that , um , it should be like we have this sort of random spot testing type of thing 
or do you think it would be more palatable if we had some sort of regular schedule 
or would that just allow everybody a chance to get out of it ? 
i think the regular schedule stuff , um , that when you say everybody get out of it , that's a good point , 
i never really thought of it that way . 
well , you know , if they have time enough they can ,
if they really can , 
um , i think is forcing it on someone after they've already agreed to the terms of employment . 
um , as far as the new hires , i missed it . um , where the new hires were concerned 
but , uh , no , 
i don't think anybody questions that , um , testing someone as a precondition to being hired 
but , um , for the conditions that , for our employment to change while you're on the job that's where i think that most people get upset . 
it's changing the rules in the middle of the game basically 
and , uh , 
and you know , it , 
people have really quieted down after everything started 
but i still think there's a lot of resentment . 
i think so too , uh , 
i know the group i was in at the time this all came up they , uh , were quite vocal about it , through electronic mail , 
boy , they just really ,
you bet . 
but , uh , it has quieted down , 
but i don't think they probably feel any differently , 
that's right . 
 and some of them did quit the company . 
i know of some people who did , uh , 
it was indirectly related , you know , 
they could always come up with other reasons 
but the whole attitude , 
because uh , it's just really , 
it seems so un , 
t i , you know , with the whole relaxed atmosphere that we have ,
you know , there's not a lot of pressure to vote the right way or anything else around t i . 
 like there is in some companies or at least , you know , 
from what i've heard , 
but , uh , 
i wouldn't like anything of that nature , you know , 
don't tell me what to do , you know . 
absolutely not , you know , 
it's , you know , 
if you hired me i'll be , you know , 
supposedly your grade was a little majority of my views and my qualifications to begin with 
so , uh , you know , let's stick with that original trust , i guess . 
but , uh , it still remains a tough question 
and , the whole department of defense , uh , reasoning behind the original plan and whatnot . 
there's a lot of different things that , uh , come into play 
but that was , 
i think everybody pretty much knows that that was kind of a smoke screen to implement it throughout the whole company . 
well , i guess too if i thought that this would help really and truly do away with the drug problem , then that would be one thing .
to have any real affect on ,
i really don't think so . 
i really don't because , some people are going to risk it , um , 
it may prevent , e , 
maybe it's worth it . 
um , you know , it may prevent somebody who was teetering on the edge of experimenting or whatnot 
but , uh , i don't know if , you know , the , 
it's a needs of the few and the needs of the many type situation 
i don't know if everybody should have to sacrifice quite as much . 
there's still a big question in my mind 
of mistakes on the testing ,
well , yes . 
i think that could be a big problem , you know , 
i would just be irate if they said it was positive and i knew it wasn't , 
you know , that just really rubbed me the wrong way . 
and that , 
prescribed for you 
but the , the prescription has run out you still had some left 
and you happen to take an extra penicillin , 
well , penicillin's not on the list 
but , you know , 
yeah , 
i think you understand what i'm getting at , 
it can still show up 
and it can still flag as a positive 
and , uh , those are the kinds of things that still can show up . 
i guess the one that really got me too was that , uh , 
let's say your spouse is on a particular drug 
and you know what that is , 
and then you end up with the same problem 
and you take their leftover medicine , 
that's not allowed . 
that's right . 
you know , that's totally out . 
that's right . 
i even had friends when i was going to college who were in , uh ,   pharmacy school 
and they could legally , um , provide medicine to their family members and friends 
certain medicines were legal now 
we would be tested for wouldn't be on those lists , 
but , uh , um , there were certain things that they could provide without a doctors prescription based on their qualifications 
oh , that's interesting . 
but , uh , 
i think so .
enjoyed talking to you . 
you too . 
well , what's your views on it ? 
i think it's , uh , a good idea . 
um , i grew up , uh , 
my teenage years were spent during the sixties , 
graduating , uh , high school in sixtyeight . um , i remember when the peace corps movement first came about , 
and i thought it was a very good idea at the time . 
i was one of those , uh , kennedy children , if you know what i mean . 
and , uh , right now i see a lot of kids who get out of school , have no idea what they want to do . 
and there's a lot of things out there that we could do , uh , for our own country , 
and i think that we've got the people power to do it , 
it's just , uh , 
we need to channel it and focus it on some things that need some fixing up . 
and there's a lot of housing , 
i know in the area that i live in , that's run down and beat up , 
but it could be fixed up and used , 
and it's just , you know , sitting there wasting away . 
we're not too far behind .
i graduated in seventyone , 
so i'm same generation . 
it's going to be a short conversation because i agree with you . 
i don't even think it ought to be , uh , voluntary , 
i think it ought to be mandatory . uh , for kids to either do military service , or public service , one of the two . 
uh , a lot of reasons for that , i'm a hard ass or anything . 
it's just that , like you say , kids are getting out of high school not knowing what in the heck they're going to do , 
and either the military or public service organization can give them a lot of focus . 
and , i think that it might stop us some problems later on . 
i mean , you know and figure out what they want to do , instead of hanging around street corners selling drugs or something . 
uh , i think it would be good for them , uh , 
it helps mature them a little bit , and helps them understand the world , the way it really is . 
i think a lot of people grow up what the world's about . 
oh , yeah . 
a lot of it has to do from too much t v , 
oh , yeah , 
and , uh , you know , and movies , and what you hear in school , and then what reality is . 
uh , i remember , uh , i've worked since i was , 
well , i started delivering papers when i was ten , 
and i had a real job when i was thirteen , 
so i've , you know , worked most of my life . 
but i remember when i got out of high school , all through high school was , 
boy , i can't wait to get out of high school , 
and i wanted to go to college , 
and i had the grades to go to college , 
and i got accepted to college , 
you know , it's 
like , you know , when i actually started working full time , i got married shortly after getting out of high school . 
i , uh , thought i was smart , ran away and got married , 
because , life , and the reality of working for a living , and trying to make ends meet , is just so overwhelming to someone ,
and most of them aren't . 
that's true . 
i mean , i mean , even in high school , 
you know , why isn't somebody stepping in putting a stop to this . 
kids in high school are just too young to be married . 
they have no idea what the world is like . 
they don't how tough it is out there to make a living . 
uh , i mean , i was in the same boat when i left high school . 
my parents wanted me to go straight to college 
and i didn't . 
you know , i was ready , 
i had wanderlust , 
i wanted to get out and see some things . 
so , i joined the air force and ended up staying there for thirteen years . 
um , but , i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time , 
 and after traveling around the world a few times , i realized that , things ain't the way they seem . 
and i did a lot of growing up there , uh , 
i think once kids get out and see how other people really live ,
that's right .
that's right . 
well , you know , it's just like you say , there's so much stuff that needs to be done here in this country , 
and , uh , you know , uh , for instance , just helping old folks . 
 you know they need help , 
they don't have anybody to depend on , 
and it would be nice to have somebody come over and cut their yard or paint their house , or do minor repairs , or something like that . 
you know , i , 
my parents are in their late sixties now , 
 um , so many of the people that live around them are unable to do those things for themselves anymore . 
and , it's really hard on them , 
and uh , the mall rats , you know , walking around the mall , nothing better to do than just walk around the mall all day long , when they could be doing something to help someone . 
and , uh , you know , uh , a nice warm feeling , 
i remember getting out of doing things like that when i was younger , 
i mean , i was a boy scout 
and the whole bit and , 
my mom's in the same position , late sixties , 
were gone , and she couldn't maintain the house , without large expenditures of money . 
you know , it finally got to a point where she just had to sell it and move into an apartment . 
and , uh , i'm not saying that that wouldn't have happened anyway , 
but it would have been nice if there had been somebody to come around and take care of the little things . you know , like the yard work and little repairs , and painting and stuff like that . 
i think you know , a , uh , economic benefit for , you know , everyone concerned ,
oh yeah , 
i mean , i mean , the kids who would be giving the service are going to get a lot more out of it than just money . 
you know , that , 
little things for the old folks around the neighborhood , 
and , uh , i know how it made me feel . 
 you know , you s , uh , 
people just don't help people anymore . 
they're out for themselves 
i think , uh , president bush covered that in his , uh , state of the union address this year when he said that , you know , it's time for , you know , the individuals to start thinking about what they can do to help each other out instead of counting on government to do everything . 
well that's the point we've gotten to , you know . 
every time somebody wants something they always turn to the government . 
and , the government's going to be limited . 
 where are they going to get the money ? 
they're going to get it from us . 
and we can do it a lot more efficiently than the government . 
we don't need to add fourteen layers of bureaucracy to a program . 
um , the thing that carter works on , uh , habitats for humanity , i was involved in that uh , in montgomery , before i came up to north carolina , 
and , uh , it was a pretty neat little program . 
we'd just go out , 
and they would buy a plot of land , and contractors and builders , 
and everybody else would donate their time , 
and , uh , the materials were at cost . 
and we'd put up houses . 
and , that was kind of neat . 
 uh , in a way , i think it's a little bit inefficient , 
 but it's better than nothing . 
and at least i had the opportunity of seeing two families move into decent housing . 
um , course , on the other hand , i can start complaining very loudly about people on public assistance who are quite capable of doing something for themselves , but just won't .
uh , we did uh , a cost comparison in one of my courses , 
and we took all the benefits a married couple with two kids would get under welfare , and what they would be making at minimum wage . 
and they came out four thousand dollars better a year , by taking welfare . 
so there's no incentive for them to do anything . 
far better for them to sit on their butts and draw the money . 
one of the things they tried to push through in maryland , and , uh , weren't very successful was that if you were an ablebodied person on welfare ,
you had to do something . 
that was tried in alabama too , 
and it got shot down . 
 and i don't understand the reasoning for it . 
i really don't . 
it seems perfectly logical that if somebody's going to take public money , then they should return something to the public . 
i mean , if nothing else , go out along an interstate and pick up garbage . 
that's exactly what they were trying to get them to do . 
what do they do in maryland , 
do they use highway people 
or do they use prisoners ? 
um , both . 
that's the way they did it in alabama , too . 
they use both . 
usually you'd see these big chain gangs out there , picking up trash . 
uh , they have another program in maryland that's called adopt a highway . 
we have that here in north carolina . 
well , good afternoon to you , mary . 
 and good , 
well , well , today , uh , when i got up it was twentynine degrees . 
and it managed to get up to about fifty this afternoon 
but it's been cloudy , overcast and threatening rain all day . 
that sounds more like our winter weather down here . 
 and we've also had extremely strong winds , fifteen to twenty miles an hour ,
well , you know , i bet that's that storm we had last night . 
is that right ? 
oh , we had a frog strangler go sweeping through here , uh , yesterday and last night . 
and we're expecting another one tonight . 
oh , really ? 
oh , i mean it was raining so hard you could swim down the street . 
 we had one of those two days ago .
well , it's probably on its way up there . 
it was heading north . 
thanks a lot .
couldn't you send us some nice weather ? 
well , it was nice today . 
oh , was it ? 
uh , in between the thunder showers , 
 well , one thing's for sure we can always discuss the weather , 
how some ever we can't do very much to change it . 
well , you know , what they say about the weather here in texas ? 
five minutes , it'll change . 
oh , yes , 
well that's about the way our weather is here also . 
and i grew up in saint louis , 
and saint louis was much the same . 
well , tell me , uh , in the spring ? 
this is , uh , about , uh , ten degrees cooler than usual . 
but about a week ago we were up to eighty and eightyfive degrees . 
you're kidding ? 
are you sure you didn't leave your refrigerator door open ? 
i was ready to turn on the air conditioning . 
no , it really was extremely warm . 
it only got down to about sixtyfive in the evening . 
we had about three or four days of that , 
and then all of a sudden a cold front came down and , uh , temperatures dropped thirty degrees in a very short length of time . 
and , uh , it has gone down gradually each day . 
this morning it was twentynine , 
yesterday it was about thirtytwo . 
so it , 
 oh , mother macree . 
i should say not . 
well , i , sincerely hope that you don't have that terrible storm we had . 
 oh , i hope , 
i hope , 
well , they are predicting rain and thunderstorms , 
and i wouldn't be a bit surprised by what we would not be getting the same weather you had . 
well , i , 
let's hope it , 
well , if it's the same as what we had , at least it'll be warmer . 
uh , yeah . 
warm rain , 
well , of course , by the time it gets up here it may run into a cold front coming down from canada . 
oh , boy , 
 whew , that would be tear disastrous . if you ,
 uh , of the city of dayton itself . 
and , uh , then we just had about an inch and a half or two inches of rain in less than an hour . 
it was just coming down by the bucketfulls and a great deal of lightning . 
and i had just gotten home . 
we had a lot of tornado warnings also . 
and i had gotten home shortly before that , uh , the rain started . 
so , uh , i felt a little more secure that i was at home rather than having to be out driving in it . 
well , uh , i heard on the news this morning that , um , one of our local schools , uh , lost the roof of their gymnasium . 
is that right ? 
and they suspected may have been a tornado . 
but , uh , uh , thank god for small favors , the , uh , uh , 
what do they call them ? the marching band or something ? 
uh , uh , had just quit rehearsal about a half hour before . 
oh , they , 
that was , very fortunate for them because that could have really been disastrous . 
oh , and how . 
well , of course this is tornado season , uh , 
in to , uh , 
we have many tornadoes spawned in this area . and northern indiana , 
now we're in the southwestern part of , uh , ohio ,
 uh , but , uh , northern indiana , has many tornadoes come roaring across . 
and we get the backlash off of it , if not the part of the tornado itself . 
so , uh , you know , we get a lot of bad weather in this area . 
but of course you're supposed to be the sun belt , 
and i do know that you get some freezing weather down there on occasion . 
oh , yeah . 
we do . 
uh , we've had , uh , well , past four or five years , i guess , at least one day during the year when just everything would just close down because we'd have freezing rain . 
and , uh , of course people down here , they just don't know how to handle themselves 
i was going to say that it does make a difference when you're not accustomed , to , uh , 
but , don't have the equipment to handle it either . 
and the , 
well all you can do spread sand on the ice . 
but , uh , you know , we don't even have vehicles that will do that . 
well , uh , well here what they do and i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do , they spread salt . 
and of course the salt does melt the ice , 
but then what melts immediately freezes and becomes , uh , a perpetual problem . 
oh , it sure does do that . 
 they do that down here too . 
they mix the salt in with the sand . 
well , sand , and , uh , 
but i have learned to do , uh , now that i am alone , is , uh , to carry bags of salt in the trunk of my car . 
um , not only in case i need it for that for traction but for additional weight ,
and then of course kitty litter is also excellent for that . i don't know whether you've ever thought in terms of ,
but kitty litter is excellent for , uh , getting under the wheels of cars 
and what have you and giving you traction . 
i guess it would be . 
it , uh , works out , uh , really quite well . 
course i have a dog also . 
my son brought me a little lhasa apso , uh , for my birthday last thanksgiving . 
he brought him from dallas . 
oh , wasn't that nice of him ? 
that , uh , 
he just thought i had been without a dog , uh , for three years . 
that was long enough . 
 he had , 
i have , uh , a chowperd myself . 
oh , a what ? 
a chowperd . 
now that one i'm not familiar with . 
well , she's part chow and part shepherd . 
uh , okay . 
that makes sense then .
but she's the best , 
i believe , 
well , i've always had big dogs before . never had a little dog before . 
well , june ,
but she is scared to death of thunder storms . 
the minute it would begin to storm , he would just panic . 
and , uh , i had to push him down when he was fourteen , 
and two months later i had to put my yellow lab down ,
and , uh , uh , then there was no point in having all my acreage . 
i had four and a half acres with game preserve on three sides . 
oh , that must be nice . 
oh , well , it was great . 
i loved it . 
but then i didn't need all that anymore , so i finally sold that , 
and i'm in a fair size condo . 
and i have a nice size patio . 
 uh , so this little dog has plenty of room to run . 
well , good . 
and he is a cutie 
uh , but i've never had a dog i had to keep taking to the groomer's to have groomed either .
 and it's , 
is that right ? 
that's what i call home . 
oh , is that right ? 
i lived there for ten years . 
oh , well i was there once way back in nineteensixty , i think for just a week's vacation . 
but , uh , that's about the only time i've been to florida , except passing through on the way to someplace else . 
 but , uh , 
 well , i lived there in the seventies . 
and , uh , i love it . 
i have two sons still living down there . 
well , uh , uh , most of my friends do spend a lot of time down in florida . 
but , uh , that's just not been my thing . 
we used to always head west or head north . 
now that i'm alone uh , i , uh , prefer to travel overseas if i'm going anywhere . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , uh , course there too you never know what the weather's going to be . 
when you ,
 well , that's , 
oh , is that right ? 
oh , i loved it down there . 
course you could natives 
oh , is that right ? 
so i think what we should talk about is , uh , the war . 
the war that just went on . 
see , i don't agree with it . 
first of all i don't believe in war . 
and i think it's all independent because , nothing to do with the united states . 
you didn't gain anything from it . 
and it wasn't our freedom that you were saving . 
it was just , 
that i saw was okay , 
iraq wants to raise oil prices . 
kuwait wants to take iraq out of the whole system ,
and like for example , see , okay , like lithuania right , they declared themselves an independent country with a president , 
well the main government in moscow goes in there 
and they kick everybody's ass . 
and the united states doesn't go in there 
but we're not going to go into your country . 
but these countries here , which , you know , are , you know , like in nineteen eightyfour , 
have you ever read that book ? 
nineteen eightyfour there are like three big continents 
and , uh , there's just this area , like around egypt and stuff ,
now the problem is that nobody's going to invade anybody else's boundaries . 
like their immediate boundaries . like you're invading their border , 
but all the other countries , you can fight about . 
and so the thing is that you're wasting so much money to send , you know , 
it's like how much money did the u s spend when they could have paid so much money for each barrel of oil that was being , 
we'll probably never know how much it actually cost . 
and you know , it was basically all based on oil because nobody 
actually , like for example , uh , let's say if , you know brazil took over you know , surinam .
you know , and , uh , that's something that has been , you know , very , 
because , see the thing is like every time that i see a war , i see myself on the front line , and on the other side i see myself again , and i've got to shoot myself , you know . 
i got to shoot somebody that's got the same family that i do . you know , the same relationships that i do . 
and just because i was born here i've got to shoot them down . 
oh , it's never a pleasant thing , 
that's true . 
it was over quick 
and there weren't that many deaths . 
 now the only problem is the aftermath ,
that's really unfortunate , 
it really is . 
i don't know if we stopped too soon , 
i really don't know what we need to do about that . 
let's kick him out of kuwait , which was our basic goal . 
and , uh , now , indirectly let's try to overthrow him , you know . 
 and they're not going to do that directly . 
 you know , you can seek asylum here , 
 and you can go there , 
but no way are you going to rule ever again . 
i've been hearing some talk too of trying to bring hussein up on , you know , criminal charges . 
i don't know if that will ever happen or not . 
well the thing they have to get him . 
which is very difficult to do . 
and there's no way that you can get them , unless it's by force . 
you know . and then you can put him on trial . 
obviously , he's not going to turn himself in . 
i think he'd rather commit suicide than turn himself in ,
you know , like if you were going to put on trial you get to live the rest of your life , but where . 
you know , and so , um , the thing is that once you've done something wrong , which is natio , 
and there's no way , you know . 
and you know like he sent planes over that were on their way to turkey . 
he had a couple of them bombarded . 
obviously human life means nothing to him . 
but , uh , you know , he's got , uh , millions of dollars , 
 oh yeah . 
that's true . 
past a point it doesn't make any difference . 
that's really , really unfortunate . 
it really is . 
but you know , like the , 
we just put our goals in different , you know , levels is 
like saying , you know , it's like 
we need oil , you know , 
 and we need it desperately . 
 but the other countries , then they went down . 
when they took that big dip it was because they discovered another big oil well somewhere in saudi arabia ,
seems like the prices never go down to where they were originally , though , before the increase started . 
well , its an advantage . 
because people are willing to pay a dollar fifty a gallon , 
so if i leave it at a dollar ten , people are still going to pay . 
you know , i went down forty cents , 
 but i went up ten cents . 
yeah . 
about the lowest i've seen gasoline in the dallas area is , uh , i guess , about ninetytwo point nine now . 
oh , god . 
here it's like a dollar five . 
oh really . 
well there's still a lot of dollar five places here 
but you can find some that's under a dollar , but not a whole lot . 
that's the lowest i've seen . 
but still the , 
i mean , have you ever checked , like , uh , the most moneymakers uh , in nineteen , uh , ninety . 
uh , you can see that , uh , 
 and that was just because of the last quarter . 
i think mobil was doing very well , too . 
well major brands are . 
and , uh , that was , 
i mean and what other companies went up four hundred and some percent . 
and that's practically impossible to do now a days , for a company to , 
that's true . 
that's true . 
and , uh , it's just that , you know , people take advantage of that . 
you know , but still if you realize that , uh , one barrel has like , how much was it , like , um forty gallons , 
something like , 
it's got forty gallons 
and they're selling , you know , you know , 
you got to pay forty dollars at least and ,
and it was selling like at twentyfive or something . 
so you're making , uh , you know , fifteen dollars profit , easily . 
and , uh , everything , 
i mean , uh , it's like who's gaining on this . 
because , uh , like , you know gas stations and stuff ? 
 because , see like for example , i don't know if the british government owns shell . 
i'm not sure about that . 
i'm not sure either . 
but the thing is like the u s government got nothing out of it .
and , uh , then the taxes go up 
and then everybody else loses . 
but , um , you know , they're just some things that might not be worth it . 
that's true . 
you know , had to die before the war , you know , 
it's like transporting stuff and things like that ,
sure , you know , like to a couple people that died there , their families don't feel it was necessary to do that . 
dead's dead . 
 you could never bring them back . 
that's true , 
oh well . 
well , i don't guess we resolved anything 
but it's interesting . 
so , okay , 
nice talking to you . 
to you too , 
take care . 
i think our experience of camping is , 
the passive member , 
i get things ready and then i enjoy . 
uh , because , my husband is a good camper 
and so they , 
he manages the troops 
and they do the work 
and i have fun .
well , uh , uh , uh , all grown up now , 
how about when they were younger , 
did you take them camping ? 
that's when we camped the most . 
i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because , uh , 
 and getting out into nature and relaxing ,
and the part that i did was more fun the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize , you know . 
isn't it . 
ha , what kinds of things have you tried ? 
have you done , uh , uh , uh , the big pot cooking ? 
oh , oh , uh , well , it was really my ex who did uh , uh , the cooking back when we first started 
and we found that one great handy things was this , uh , uh , uh , hamburger helper .
oh , yeah . 
you dumped everything in together 
and it was enough for all six of us . 
oh , that's interesting . 
you know , interesting enough , uh , the food part was kind of , uh , important thing in our camping . 
uh , when my oldest son , uh , 
always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything . 
but the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son mark took his , uh , uh , cooking merit badge in , 
and mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff 
and , uh , 
and so , uh , after he took that merit badge , he did all the shopping and getting ready for it . 
well that's great . 
it was a marvelous experience because after that , then all i had to do was , uh , follow the instructions , you know and do . 
and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things 
like i would take corn bread and , uh , cook a pan inside of a pan over a camp , uh , stove . 
and it works real good . 
it's like an oven . 
just uh , put a thing on it . 
i mean . 
what did you like to do most ? 
well really just commune with nature . 
we started out , uh , 
well we were living in florida at the time 
and early in life , we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very , very expensive . 
i agree . 
and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent . 
and that's how we got started . 
we did it for years and years , uh . 
yes and no . 
or it can get chilly . 
but , uh , there's really no time of the year that you can't go . 
 oh , is that true ? 
 uh , becau , 
now , now we're in texas now 
and you're in texas , 
okay , uh , 
we have not camped a great deal here because , uh , a good share of the time in the summer time , it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping . 
well , it just depends on where you go , 
for instance ,
i gue , 
we have done that .
but we camped mostly , 
when the kids were little 
it's just about twelve miles south of , the new york border . 
and we'd go up to the adirondacks and camp 
and it was so , you know , pick your own , uh , blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast .
oh yes , 
uh , also , 
i co , 
go ahead . 
i'm a new yorker myself . 
oh , are you ? 
where did you live ? 
a little town called tuckaho , over by white plains . 
oh , oh yeah , 
i know that . 
i had a cousin who lived in white plains , 
that's a neat area . 
but that is a particularly neat area for camping because , 
well that i wouldn't know 
i left there when i was quite young . 
it is neat though because there are lots of lakes , fairly near by , 
you don't have to go very far . 
uh , and there's , uh , a lot of trees , lot of mountains , and lot of , uh , hiking sort of things 
little clipper sail boat . 
and so we would sail and , uh , did a lot of camping that way . 
well , uh , i outgrew , uh , sleeping bags and , uh , tents , 
 and i now have a motor home . 
oh , do you . 
we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis 
and it's fun , too , i think . 
well i live in mine . 
do you ? 
that's neat , 
so you kind of , uh , uh , an everyday camper .
uh , well , yes 
a full time camper . 
well now , are you living alone now , 
well just me and my dog . 
you and your dog , huh , .
that sounds great . 
well , we don't camp quite as much as we used to , 
but , uh , i still think it's a great way to spend a time with your family ,
 oh yes , 
i'd always , 
nothing like the fresh outdoors . 
i'd always come home just relaxed and , uh , comfortable and ready to go at it again , 
so it was a neat activity . 
good to talk to you . 
tell me your name again . 
jack , 
all right . 
are you , uh , from dallas too , beth . 
we're in plano , 
 but we've been here about , uh , eighteen years . 
well that's where i am , 
are you , 
how about that . 
well we're all , lots of people from t i up this way . 
all right , 
good to talk to you . 
nice talking to you too , beth . 
all right , 
how do you feel about them ? 
well , i keep trying to get away from them , 
i used to use a lot of credit cards 
i guess for a while i would use , you know , a variety of the visa and the mastercard and the stores , 
but i think i impulse buy too much with them 
or i buy things , you know , i see it on sale 
and i really don't need it 
or i really haven't budgeted for it 
so , um , the last couple of years i really have tried not to use them at all . 
what about you ? 
well , we have this philosophy , we use it when we go off somewhere 
but we pay for it as soon as we come back , you know , 
as soon as we get our bills ,
and we only have one . 
we tore all the rest of them up . 
 , okay . 
because i don't like credit cards for one thing , you know , 
i mean , they're okay , i guess , 
if you're on a trip or something ,
but i don't like using them because i've seen too many people that used them and ended up bankrupt or on ,
because they have this weird opinion that if you use that card , you don't have to pay for it . 
that's true 
if it's on the credit card it doesn't seem like it's money out of your pocket . 
and it gives you um , a false sense of security or something it seems like 
but you're going to have to pay for it , 
and it seems like  . . . 
but that's probably paying for things that were still owed from last time , .
are you married ? 
oh , okay . 
well , i know that a lot of young people , you know , i , 
it took me a long time to get it through my child's head , 
i mean , that was her goal , you know , uh , got to have a credit card , 
but now that she has one , 
she's only used it one time 
but she wanted to establish some credit , 
and my husband's sister is the world's worst at , oh , 
well , i'll just use the credit cards 
and she has all of her credit cards up to the limit . 
 but  . . . 
 besides the fact that how much interest you pay and then this  . . . 
and people don't see that either . 
this thing that you thought you got on sale , by the time you get done paying with that with all the finance charges because you pay it off over a long period of time , 
you've spent a heck of a lot of money on that thing . 
the only one that we have that we kept was the discover card , 
and it pays you to use it .
and you make that money as long as you don't ever have to pay them any , uh , interest . 
now it's , 
but they don't realize that if they , 
i mean , it only takes one time for you to use it and not pay the interest , 
i mean , you have to pay the interest , not pay it right off , 
that's going to take up what you would have made . 
so that's the only reason that we kept that , 
we debated for a long time 
plus they don't have that , um , charge on it , you know , 
like  . . . 
service charge you mean ? 
yearly fee , 
they don't have one of those . 
 so , it , 
we decided that was it , you know , 
and , i mean , everybody calls us and wants to give us a credit card . 
we  could  have credit cards running down our ears . 
oh , you get that stuff in the mail all the time . 
and then , i'll have ,  just like   , uh , department stores . 
they'll call me up , you know , 
and i'll say , 
look , i don't want the credit card , 
well , we're just going to send it to you , you know , 
you don't have to ever use it if you don't want to . 
 they'll  send me  any  credit card , 
i tear it up . 
i just can't see it . 
what i really hate in the mail is like for the credit cards that i do have still , 
and they say , hey , you know , two thousand dollars , you know , free to you kind of thing , you know , 
all you got to do is go cash those things 
and you've got a short term loan . 
i hate it , .
i know it , 
and you know what  . . . 
i can't believe they have the nerve to do that . 
what's really bad about those though is just like 
young people if they don't , you know , 
we take the time to , you know , help my daughter , 
she's in college , 
but this is her first credit card thing , 
well , when she got her first one she was so excited 
it was unreal . 
look at this  they  sent me this money , you know . 
of course , she tore it up . 
 but a lot of parents would not take the time , you know , 
and they wouldn't even think of it 
or their kids may not be as close as my daughter 
and i 
and , uh , you know , they may not even discuss it , 
they go out and cash their check thinking that , you know , 
they've got something , 
maybe they've won something . 
 you know , somebody sent them something free . 
 and go out and spend it . 
and , um , it's just unreal . 
i mean , i don't like credit cards , 
i wish that they would come up with some other way to , you know , 
the only way you could use them is if you were , like on vacation . 
they would let you use it maybe once a year . 
you know , i mean , of course , i guess some people go out and spend their whole entire limit on it like that at that time 
but , um , i have seen so many people 
and i have a friend right now she just got off of thirteen . 
she got , uh , 
i can't remember what she called it , 
it's some kind of , 
maybe it's  sure  or something like that , 
it's some weird name of a credit card , 
and she is charging out of her mind already . 
and i'm going , 
you just got off . 
that's how you got on to it to start with , you know , what is the matter with this person , .
and i just don't see it like that . 
of course , i always  see  pay the bills first 
and whatever's leftover , that's what you have , 
but , um , maybe a lot of people don't see it like that , 
but i can't stand owing . 
i mean , i cannot fully tolerate to owe something like , you know , 
i guess it's just because i've been brought up like that . 
but , um , i could not charge to the limit and knowing that i was going to have to pay this thing out for ever and maybe suffer from having to payout . 
but , that's just the way i feel about it . 
i think me generation 
and that , 
we think we need all these things 
and i think my parents always , you know , did without or saved up to , you know , buy things 
and we consider that so many of these things we just have to have , you know , 
like when i first got my apartment and i was setting it up i did try to economize some 
but , you know , i was just like , well , i have to have it all furnished and i have to have all of my kitchen setup 
and you don't , you know , do without too much 
and , you know , that's how i got started kind of with setting up a household all up , you know , it kind of like , in the short amount of time . 
you know , you just have to have these things just , you know , have them at home , have to have them at my own place 
and that's , you know , a big expenditure to start , um , buying all these things that you think or have to have 
and actually they're kind of luxuries 
or you should save up slowly and keep buying them and not just rush out and furnish the whole place ,
 , yeah . 
but we're not into that . 
we're into like , have to have it all now . 
 oh , yeah . 
i guess it is like that though because it seems like more and more people are like that . 
but , um , i guess it's because i'm older , 
i mean , i'm not real old 
but i am older 
and , um , you know , i didn't feel like i had to have everything . 
i guess it was because , 
well , i had everything when i was at home 
but i don't know why i didn't . 
well , we're geared to that . 
we're like , 
and i'll save for two years , 
 , uhhuh . 
 , yeah . 
people  aren't  tuned in to like saving for it and then buying it , 
they just put it on account , 
it's always have to have it now . 
 , no , 
 so , we don't , uh , have big balances on them at , 
all now you know , we , 
i use it occasionally 
but i pay it right off . 
we're  . . . 
well , you learned then , 
and i've never been one to itemize on my income , tax and never had enough to itemize 
and so it's just a big chunk of money 
and you realize that you're not buying anything on sale your paying , so much more for that item , because you've got finance charge and the cost of having that card every year which is what , forty dollars sometimes just to have the card . 
that's , a lot of money that you went to buy this item . 
and then you never feel like you've got anything to put into savings or anything , 
you're always just paying bills , you know , 
you don't feel that you have any extra to save . 
and i hate living paycheck to paycheck . 
i like to have a little there , you know , 
that i can , save 
 so i can feel that , you know , if something comes up i've got the money to pay for it , .
 oh , okay . 
are you ready ? 
the middle east crisis should we be there ? 
oh , dear that's a hard one . 
that's really hard for me because , uh , you know , i have a son that's sixteen 
and i think , you know , eventually , you know , he'll be of drafting age . 
and yet i'm proud to be an american 
and i know that we have a country that , you know , people would give anything to live in , a lot of people anyway because we have so many wonderful things that they don't have . 
and yet , i don't know whether i'd be willing to give his life for this country 
and the tired excuse that we went to war to save us against communism 
but i'm not sure that that's the reason anymore . i mean , not sure that communism is as strong as it once was . 
and i'm not sure like we were in vietnam supposedly so . 
well , you realize why we were in the middle east . why we invaded iraq , why we were 
well , with the , 
i really believe it's because , 
i think it has something to do with oil , don't get me wrong . 
but saddam is a madman . 
oh , yeah . 
i agree with that . 
anyone that would use chemical weapons to fight his own people , 
oh , yeah . 
he's , uh , a bad person , very definitely , 
oh , sure . 
 and if , you know , 
i can see that he was in kuwait 
kuwait was the nonaggressor 
 and the saudis are our allies . 
we have several treaties and several alliances with the saudis that range back for probably forty years . 
many years . 
you know they've been our through thick and thin . 
shouldn't we try and help our friends ? 
but at what cost , you know , 
that's it came out wonderfully supposedly 
i mean everything is 
what did we lose ,
 and we won . 
and that's wonderful 
but what if that wasn't the case . 
what if we would have lost thousands of young men . 
would it have been too much of a price to pay for that ? 
i don't know . 
see , and i think there are a lot of things that we don't know 
of course ,
the american people , 
oh , sure . 
well , and there's a lot ,
 and that's , 
i think that's true 
but i think there's a lot that the public doesn't need to know . 
i think there's some things we shouldn't know just for national security sake . 
and i don't think people could handle it . 
so i think there are things that the masses shouldn't know 
but i also agree that there are a lot of crooks and liars too . 
you know , it's , uh , 
i went on jury duty here not long back . 
and uh , one of the guys that was on the jury they were asking him if you could believe a lawyer or if a ,
and one guy being selected snickered and couldn't keep his head up , you know , 
he said that when he graduated , the day after his bar examine 
his lips are moving . 
oh , my gosh .
and ninety percent of all politicians ,
have a lawyer background , 
you're right . 
so by definition all lawyers and politicians are liars . 
the fact that they take our money and don't do what we think is right makes them thieves . 
that's true . 
so what's it going to cost us in the long run there in saudi ? 
are we going to lose more lives there ? 
see , and i don't know i can't tell the future that's what scares me so much about it . 
i mean i thought the war was going to go on and on . 
i really was surprised when it ended so quickly 
well , we hit them with more in one month than we used in the last three years of vietnam . 
i know . 
and whenever you strike on open terrain with that sheer volume 
we were there , 
the brits were there . 
the french were there . 
this is with u n backing 
 and to some level even russia was behind . 
they were . 
so honestly if there was a well perceived war , world wide this was it . 
oh , sure . 
but what i can't understand is then many of the kuwaiti youth wouldn't fight . 
it's okay for us to go extend our youth's lives like so much water in the desert . 
and it's not their job to fight for their own land . 
 it's very strange . 
uh , and yet , you know , see that's another thing that's difficult for americans , 
their culture is so much different than ours , you know , 
i've heard from many people that we could not even begin to understand how they feel about things because their values and their perceptions are so much different than ours 
and , um , they just don't think the same way we do . 
their culture is completely different and almost opposite . 
and really from all indications the iraqi beliefs , if you will , are more similar to our own . 
that's true . 
and the kuwaitis aren't even helping rebuild their own country . 
the kuwaiti young won't rebuild anything . 
they won't work . 
uh , i didn't realize that . 
it was on the news last night . 
oh , my word . 
the , uh , u s army is doing it all . 
uh , yeah . 
should we still be there even , you know ? 
i don't know the answers to those questions . 
i think they're tough 
and i think , you know , it's , 
i don't know that anybody knows the answers . 
i think they know what they believe 
but i'm not sure they really are one hundred percent sure . 
well , they talked to one kuwaiti woman yesterday . 
and her biggest concern in life was that she couldn't get a housekeeper . 
you're kidding . 
that's unreal . 
and , do you have a housekeeper ? 
well , i wouldn't mind having one . 
oh , i'd love to have one 
but , you know . 
but , you know , i'd like to make sure that i have a job tomorrow first . 
that's right . 
it astound , 
you realize that the kuwaiti government gives every kuwaiti man , woman , and child money . 
uh , no . 
for nothing . 
for sitting on there kiesters . 
uh , they do nothing . 
they hand them money each year 
and they're part of , 
i'll let you go first . 
 well i think , i don't know how your schools work back there 
but we support our schools here with property taxes . 
and the land owners or home owners are the ones that pay the school tax . 
so if you're renting a house or doing anything else , you're not actually contributing to the education of your children . 
and i think that's wrong , 
i think everybody should contribute to the education of their children even if they had to raise the sales tax by one percent then everybody going through the state would be supporting our education system . 
 so , as it turns out , we don't really have a tremendous education system because they don't have the money they need to run it . 
 uh , i spent a couple , uh , years down in , uh , plano , texas . 
and , uh , i was one of the home owners down there that got taxed to death ,
and , uh , you know , i know that texas doesn't have a state tax , 
and so all the things come out of the property taxes , 
and i was , uh , really shocked at the amount of taxes i ended up paying . 
back in maryland , where ,  , 
you would be . 
than i was , uh , paying the , uh , property tax down there . 
uh , what they did in maryland to get around that is uh , they developed a renters tax solely for the purpose of paying for the services ,
and , uh , the tax was administered by , uh , the , uh , rental company that actually was managing the apartments 
so when , 
and the tax payment went to pay for the services that i was getting as a resident of that particular county . 
and , uh , that's the way it worked . 
here in maryland your property taxes , uh , goes to education , 
but also a portion of the state tax that you pay goes back into the county that you live in , to pay for the educational system . 
oh , well that's pretty good . 
and so it works out nice , 
it makes it so that the , uh , whole county now , 
i know the concept of counties in texas is quite a bit different than it is here in maryland , uh , 
like collin county , uh , would only equal about maybe an eighth the size of baltimore county , here in maryland . 
oh , yeah . 
i mean the counties are much larger . 
you know , in the whole state of maryland i believe there's only like , uh , fifteen counties . 
gee whiz . 
and , so , uh , you know each county has their own school system and it works out real nice . 
um , the flip side to this is , are we getting what we're paying for , 
and i don't believe so , um . 
a lot of things have come to head recently 
and i heard a report because , of , uh , uh , the emphasis that the president was putting on education , you know , 
um , they said since they imposed the federal regulations on education , 
in other words , they came up with this federalized system where everyone in the third grade would be taught basically the same thing . 
and , then , at the end of , uh , school year they would be tested 
and then they go into the fourth grade 
and everybody in the fourth grade's basically taught the same thing . 
so when they came up with this nationwide system of public schools , uh , they gave some figures out 
and since it's inception , uh , they've , the prices paid by the federal government per student has been thirtythree percent . 
and so they're actually spending thirtythree percent , 
and that's real dollars , you know , 
and what they've said is that we haven't had a thirtythree percent improvement in education . 
we've actually gone backwards . 
well they say that texas schools are some of the lowest in the nation . 
that our high school graduates can't even match the national average . 
so , you know , our school system down here is no where near perfect 
but they keep complaining they don't have the money to do it . 
well , good sized city . 
uh , they've been putting a lot of , uh , stress on it 
and of course , speaking of stress the teachers are all getting stressed out from trying to , you know , do everything they're supposed to do 
and of course they've , uh , been cutting the teachers salaries ,
oh , yeah . 
but uh , a lot of emphas , now is being put on , you know , when children used to be taught , you know , like , uh , uh , each child is individual , 
you know , they're not all the same 
they need to take things at their own speed . 
some do horrible , you know , until they get to like tenth grade , 
and then all of a sudden everything clicks in , you know . 
and then there are some students that , you know , read well at five years old ,
and so you know , one of the things i heard proposed on , uh , one of the public radio stations up here was that we should go back to teaching children at their own speed . some ki , 
they can't keep force feeding things to each other and , 
because he can't do it . 
i mean , like , you know , that's ridiculous . 
and it's not that he can't do it , 
he just can't do it quite as fast , 
and , uh , you know , i have five children total , 
and i've got two out of the house already 
and i have two that are in , uh , eighth grade this year . 
all right . 
and prior to their , um , 
identified as being slow . 
and so they put them into special programs 
and then we actually held them back in fourth grade . 
and it wasn't until the last two years , um , 
last year my , uh , 
they're a set of twins ,
last year the , uh , boy twin started doing real well . 
all right . 
and everything started to click in for him 
and he knew what he needed to do . 
um , and this year uh , for the daughter . 
um , all right . 
she just has been ,
jumped on out there . 
and she has the right attitude towards school and everything . 
that's good . 
and i think it's just a matter of everybody has to find their own path . 
i remember when i was in school , i did horrible up until about , 
i did too , up until ninth or tenth grade . 
to come around and realize 
 and basically i got interested in math ,
but , you know once you got interested in something and things started to click in place then after that you take off . 
and see when i was a kid growing up and going to high school if i wanted to take a little electronics course , i had a electronics course i could take , 
but we lived out in the country , 
and we didn't have all that fancy stuff to worry about , you know , 
we had our auto shop out there and our ag shop 
but they don't have it anymore . 
there's a lot of things that they don't do in school anymore . 
our oldest boy goes to lubbock high down here 
and they go to school four and half days a week , 
it is , um , 
my children had a , uh , real culture shock , uh , when we lived in plano , 
i guess , i don't know if you've heard about the plano school district , 
and , uh , god , if your child is not an honor student , well then , you're , something wrong with you as a parent . 
and that's kind of the way they are there . 
and , uh , when we moved back to maryland , um , i moved to uh , a , baltimore county which is a northern county in maryland , 
and it's basically a rural county , once you get above about the half way point . 
and we lived , you know , in the northern part of the county . 
uh , we went from a , uh , middle school in texas that served fiftyfive square blocks to a , uh , middle school in maryland that served fiftyfive square miles . 
and it was just a complete culture shock ,
 i can imagine . 
that would be quite a shock . 
and they had , uh , ag , 
they had an ag course , uh , 
i forget what it was called , uh , 
but it goes along the lines of industrial arts , 
but it's , agricultural . 
and where they had to raise a small animal . 
oh , like , four h then . 
had to learn how to drive a tractor . 
all right . 
they actually had to take a driving test on the tractor , 
i mean , they just couldn't believe this 
and it was great . 
they loved it . 
all right . 
i mean they really enjoyed the courses , um , 
and you know , it made school fun for them again because prior to that school was just a big pain , a drain . 
just something you do everyday . 
and it was , you know . 
it was like , kind of like the way we feel about going to work .
just something i have to do everyday . 
but , uh , up here they seem to have made it , uh , a lot of fun for them 
and they seem to really enjoy it . 
that's good , 
our oldest boy went into school politics and made vice  . . . 
you have pets , i understand , a couple of them . 
what are they ? 
well i don't know if they consider themselves animals anymore . 
they actually , you know , sort of take over the place 
and we're kind of their pets . 
they think they own you .
don't they really ? 
they own the place 
and naturally these are cats , 
these are cats . 
i remember one time , uh , i used to get a chuckle out of pogo . 
that dates me quite a bit , 
you probably don't know po , 
oh , pogo , 
when beauregard was talking he was the dog , remember . 
i agree , 
and i think that's true , 
i , don't know , 
i think that , um , 
my husband and i are in such a situation that , uh , um , i'm kind of , um , not able to do a lot , 
i'm kind of in a wheelchair , 
i mean i kind of am , 
oh , uhhuh . 
but , uh , 
i've got these two cats that hang around with me all day , 
th , co , 
and i don't what i'd do without them . 
it is 
you know it's funny how pets get to be so , uh , 
you really do mourn them after , when things happen . 
now we don't actually have a pet right now . 
uh , but we have had some 
it's always hard for me to believe how close i've gotten to them . 
we had a little , uh , uh , oh , dog , 
it was a little , uh , 
i got it so it wouldn't shed ,
oh my . 
oh , really . 
and , uh , i used to come down stairs in the morning to feed him , you know , 
and i'd let him up out of the basement where he was sleeping 
and he would just dance around the floor 
and i just got , 
and we only had him about three or four weeks before he was hit by a car , 
but i cannot believe the whole family just , 
i could not believe it . 
i have to tell you about our most interesting pet , though . 
 uh , we had an iguana living with us for uh , 
oh , uh , by choice ? 
it was about three feet long . 
it was a beautiful animal , 
name was clyde . 
clyde the iguana . 
and , uh , my son dan went uh , to , uh , hawaii for the summer 
and when he came home , uh , he didn't bring the iguana with him 
but for some reason or other he had a thing for them . 
i don't know whether he'd , 
i think there was one in the school , uh , zoology department , you know , 
and anyway , in mexico , 
i don't know where . 
but anyway he brought this home 
and i looked at him 
but you know i visualize that animal racing about , 
and you know , like you think of lizards doing but they don't do that . 
they're very much like , uh , 
well , the thing about them is that they hold so still you don't notice that they're there 
and then they move and about scares you to death sometimes . 
did you have him in a cage ? 
oh no , 
he just loved to sit on the back of my dryer where the heat came up out of the dryer , you know . 
he was really a neat pet 
and though i , you know , 
he'd ri , 
when we'd have family home evening and everybody would sit in the living room and the fire would be burning he'd walk across my feet sometimes .
and it was a long time before i could really pet him 
but i fed him 
and he knew how to get me to feed him . 
he'd come out to the kitchen ,
oh no , 
 but he was really a neat animal . 
he'd lay in dan's lap , you know , 
and just , uh , when he'd pet him , he'd just stretch 
and , you know , you could see him just enjoying it like a cat does . 
oh no . 
it was kind of interesting . 
but he did a lot of interesting things 
and , uh , dan carried him around 
and he liked to ride on the back and scare everybody to death 
and  ,
oh , my goodness . 
kids just came from all over to come and see clyde and visit with him 
and he tolerated them , you know . 
he'd even tolerate him petting though , 
he didn't like them too well at first , 
but he got tame , you know , 
 so uh , people could go in there . 
and dan was a drummer , 
and the only thing he didn't like very well was the drumming . 
was the drumming . 
when dan would drum he'd sit there and scrunch up , you know 
like he was trying to  ,
and cover his ears . 
and then he'd leave the room .
isn't that funny the way we put , you know , um , human characteristics on an animal like that 
 oh yeah , 
well they take on human characteristics like ,
i guess they do . 
the next year our son ken went to hawaii 
and well , while dan was in hawaii , ken decided he wanted a dog 
and he looked around a long while 
and he found a norwegian elkhound 
and he just brought this norwegian elkhound an ,
and he was so funny . 
uh , for a while they built a run for him out to the side of the house , you know . 
he'd been on the patio 
but they put the run out there , 
and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by 
and sometimes he would just make a racket until you came and got him . 
and one night we'd forgotten to put water out for him 
and i were in bed 
and all of a sudden there was all this noise out to the side the house 
and he'd pick up his dish and throw it in the air .
  he used a classic illusion  .
and then he'd pick up his dish again and throw it in the air until we came out and gave him some water . 
i forgot to ask you , did the iguana catch flies for you ? 
did what ? 
did the iguana catch flies for you ? 
uh , we fed him the outside leaves of lettuce , you know , 
i'd get lettuce at the store 
and he'd eat the outside leaves . 
and then in the summertime you could put him out 
and he'd eat outside except you had to keep him away from the garden because he liked to eat the little peas as fast as they came up , you know . 
i bet .
 it was s really a   of things that were fresh sprigs , you know , 
he liked that . 
well can we ask you whatever happened to clyde ? 
well , yeah , 
and , uh , everybody was used to him 
and they just loved him and what not 
and his roommate put him out one day 
and dan didn't know it 
and it got dark 
and he didn't get him in again . 
and they searched and searched and searched for him 
but , uh , uh , it got too cold up there 
and he died in a tree . 
they found him the next day in a tree , 
oh , oh my . 
so you have to be pretty tender with them , 
 uh , and , uh , hot pad he laid on , you know . 
that was another funny thing , 
he had a hot pad 
and it burned up one time 
and boy , that was funny too , watching him kind of burned up 
but anyway . 
an we got him a new one , 
he had a blue one before 
and when we got him a new one it was brown 
and he wouldn't lay on it until we changed the covers . 
oh , really , 
because that was like what he was used to . 
bu , so they really pick up things . 
he was a clean animal , uh , 
he went to the bathroom in the bathroom . 
how did he do that ? 
 well we put some papers on the floor ,
and he went there to go to the bathroom . 
you had to be sure you left the doors open , you know , 
he didn't like to go anywhere else , 
he'd scratch and do all kinds of things to get you to open the door , if you happened to close it on him or something , you know , 
oh , no . 
if you just let it dry , it dries kind of like , uh , 
especially when he was inside and just eating lettuce , it dried up a little bit like ashes 
and you could just vacuum it up . 
oh my goodness . 
in the winter time there was no odor at all to it . 
and in the summertime when he was outside and eating outside the smell was a little bit like a cat , you know . 
oh , yeah . 
but , uh . 
but that's incredible . 
it's a different little things , t , 
he was a really interesting animal . 
oh , that's , 
 uh we just really   
and you know , to this day i still miss him 
and that's been years ago . 
well see , i guess it's because you lived with , you know , him an , 
he was just , 
i think , i guess so . 
but it was interesting . 
well , what do your cats do besides sitting and purring and letting you pet them .
oh , my goodness , these guys , they , 
oh , and you just kind of took them , over , huh . 
well , well actually it's like he's the cat person you know , 
and i was always kind of nondescript in that category because i always liked dogs . 
and they've kind of taken over 
 and , uh , you know . 
maybe it is , 
they're so independent , 
well i'm glad we have two of them , otherwise , i think they get neurotic if there just one of them . 
they get real crazy . 
but there , brother and sister from the same litter . 
they look totally different , 
 well they are siamese cats , 
oh , pretty ones . 
but one is , uh , um , 
they're both registered , you know , 
one's a seal point , 
she's the little girl 
and then , uh , uh , the , 
he is something . 
he's like a dog , 
  he just wants his belly scratched 
and that's it , you know . 
and he's just the warmest thing in the wintertime , 
he just sits on your lap , 
but they're like seven ye ,  . . . 
tell me what books you read . 
well , um , i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately . 
i read , uh , one book a friend recommended to me . 
i can't even remember the guy's name . 
it was a science fiction , dean cole , or something like that . 
and it was so frightening 
and it had so much violence in it 
i just  ,
i try to avoid the , 
i didn't think it was so great . 
she thought it was riveting , you know , 
but , i couldn't deal with that . 
but , um , mostly i read , 
i'm a marriage and family counselor 
and mostly i read things to do with raising kids , 
and now i have two little kids , 
or codependency , or , you know , fifty thousand things like john bradshaw's books on , uh , the family and 
i read usually that kind of stuff . 
and right now i'm reading , um , judith viorst's book called necessary losses , where she talks about different losses that we've had in our lives that we have to get past if we're going to mature and 
in my spare time with a two and a half and a three and a half year old  ,
that does cut into your ,
that's really changed my reading habits , because i used to read so much , especially when i was in school . 
you know , but , gosh uh , it's getting pathetic now .
well my , 
so , you know , i will , uh , encourage you that .
later you're , 
so you can .
what do you read ? 
oh , uh , well , i read for a living . 
you do ? 
oh , well how interesting . 
and s , 
what kind of books ? 
 and therefore ,
and you name it . 
i've read some of it . 
well that sounds like a fascinating job . 
it really is . 
and the , uh , 
it's nice to work with people with you about them . 
if they don't ,
 that's true . 
well , you probably , 
i seem to remember that , uh , little byline on a lot of things i've read . 
um , is that , um , 
do they have a mail kind of campaign that they send to professionals in the ,
uh , normally we don't publish , uh , things under our own  ,
that sounds so familiar . 
but , i also get , of course , lots of references to neat stuff to read about . 
so , i should read the , uh , titles of the five books that are sitting on my desk right now that i'm in the middle of . 
it causes the , uh ,  ,
i thought that was going to be some , 
oh , my goodness . 
and a book called job flip flopped from one gender predominance to the other , 
nursing 
and now it's practically all women . 
and  that , uh   , 
i bet that used to be mostly men who were secretaries of any type for business . 
that's right . 
and the ,
when you wrote it out in long hand you were a , 
then you were important .
you were a confidential assistant to the ,
like the scribes who did the old documents , you know , for churches and ,
and then , 
well , that's interesting . 
and then i have one novel that's called first light , 
that's about , uh , archaeology 
so , it's really quite interesting . 
i haven't ,
so , are you reading these in the form of just like printed manuscripts ,
but , they're just things ,
so i got them out of the library and decided i'd read some more in them . 
my goodness . 
well , that's fascinating . 
so , i read a lot of history and , uh , a few novels , occasional mystery stories , just ,
i never have gotten into any of the romantic novels or any of that kind of stuff . 
my husband reads a lot of the , um , 
well , he did before we had kids  ,
oh , yeah . 
but , he's got quite a collection of those . 
but , uh , my stuff one thou , let's see , 
i've got one called one thousand practical parenting tips ,
oh , hey . 
i've done that to every pair my three year old has . 
you know , really . 
oh , i think the , 
 and , uh , 
oh , yeah . 
i think that's incredibly   .
but there's a surprising number that are still around that don't have those , 
so that's an alternate means of dealing with  , 
but , um , i'm trying to think of what else i've got . 
uh , since i'm , um , a therapist and all , i've done recently a lot of research into some of the twelve step groups . 
so , i've got all the different alcoholics , what they call the blue book , the big book ,
so i'm trying to get more familiarized with that because i refer clients and different groups 
and , uh , 
what do you think is ,
 um , oh , i have a love affair with john bradshaw . 
i just have found everything i've read of his to be fabulous ,
he started out with one called the family , which does the family systems and people's roles in the family . 
and then he did , uh , healing the shame that binds you ,
and then the third one that he came out with is now called homecoming .
uh , and , uh , there's a subtitle to it , 
i never can remember what it is . 
it's something like , um , a journey in your inner ,
i knew ,
he was 
and now he's had the first one and the third one put into a ten session , uh , p b s series . 
i saw one of those episodes on p b s . 
i know .
so people can just tape them i guess ,
but , i .
he's just probably been one of the most , 
there's an author um , used to be in dallas . 
it seems like we have a lot of these that have been in  ,
and she's got some fabulous workbooks out and a whole series of tapes and , uh , 
 so that's been bear ,
 oh , yes . 
but , i really have enjoyed exploring children's literature because there's so much more , uh , new things out that , you know , 
i'd pull out the classics once in a while for my kids , 
but there's such cute things ,
 oh , there's some , 
 oh , i know . 
and i just go to the library because they're expensive , 
 i mean , it , 
and they go through them so fast ,
so i really have been going to the library and getting my ten books out 
and they just love to sit and read . 
and now finally the littlest one is oldest to sit , you know , and watch the pictures instead of grabbing it and trying ,
  uh   , well , 
 so , do that you ,
i read , 
but i was tickled to see that some publisher is , uh , reprinting the james thurber books for children . the ,
 oh , wonderful . 
well , i'm going to have to ,
and they really did ,
i didn't buy them when my kids were little . 
and so , they probably were out of print all of , already when my kids were small . 
but , um , 
i guess it's in honor of his hundredth , 
well , i don , 
i mean , what thoughts do you have on the subject ? 
uh , you know , we even lived there for a while when my husband was in the navy . 
oh , you did ? 
in fact the first year we were married , he had been there two years when we got married 
and so our , 
that's wonderful . 
well you probably have a different sense than i have . 
i went to an inner city high school in chicago . 
um , and that's not where i am originally from . 
it was a divorce situation of my parents . 
and it was a cultural shock to me .
i'm sure . 
the high school in fact , it was called  tulley  high school 
and now it's called roberto clemente .
 roberto died while we were there as a matter of fact . 
 yeah , that's exactly , about twenty years now . 
uh , what was it like living there , 
i mean did you find that people appreciated having the privilege of being , 
it's like anywhere else . 
people are individuals 
and i find it really difficult and , frustrated trying to make stereotypes , you know . 
i agree with that , 
and , uh , the school , uh . 
i didn't mean that in a totally negative sense . 
it's just , 
if it's not part of your culture ,
i had gone to a very , uh , uh ,  , um , conservative , uh , college 
and when i started teaching school it was in an inner city situation ,
they weren't like any of the mexican american or black people i had gone to school with 
so it was , 
that you had ever been . 
i mean , i'll give you and idea that i had , um , 
and the majority appreciated what they were having in this country . 
 uh , but a lot of the ones that didn't word , they made it worse for the other kids in school . 
and , you know , chicago , back then , even had bilingual classes . 
oh , really . 
and i mean , i had geometry , 
the teacher was from cypress greece 
so if you can imagine how i even go ,  , 
 oh , my . 
 i mean , and i guess i look at is as an enlightening sense . 
 um , but basically , i think they should leave things the way they are right now , 
i mean , i don't really have enough in terms of an argument , pro or con in terms of making any type of change . 
i'm not , so much against their making , uh , it a state . 
 but i would want a very clear majority , 
because if the minority can be so , vociferous , whether you're talking this group , or , 
that's exactly . 
 and miserable for everybody else . 
and that's exactly , 
i mean , i can remember instances that , uh , wasn't as , uh , you know , bad , 
lord , i don't know how it would be today . 
well i know what it looks like , 
i've been back up for a reunion . 
that my give you a clue . 
it does , 
um , but it's an experience i wouldn't change , 
i mean my husband , um , grew up in , um , a majority , uh , wasp , southern ohio , you know . 
 so that , um , 
when he saw where i , you know , saw my later teenage years , he was just , i hate to say aghast , because that sounds so trite , 
but he was . 
and yet , how did i turn out the way i did turn out . 
what you find is that , um , if you can talk to like , 
i mean , i learned a lot about the , um , island of puerto rico from talking to these kids . 
you know , and you lived there 
 so you know that parts of it are beautiful and parts of it are squalor . 
same as any other part of the world , 
 like here , yeah , 
i don't think it's really to their best interests ,
they have the best of both worlds . 
they have , uh , representation , 
 but they don't have to pay all the taxes and so forth that we do . 
 this is true . 
uh , being that it's an island economy , um , 
everything is imported 
and yes , the cost of living is super high , 
to pay for the rights and privileges . 
i know what you're saying , 
 so , so you know , i would just as soon , 
for independence , i would back them a hundred percent . 
and that's , 
i probably would say the something if i knew intellectually that it was good 
you know , it's just , um , 
they count , yeah , as a principle , 
that's what i thought . 
um , but i've also been down there . 
we traveled a lot to the b v i , the british virgin islands . 
 oh , yes , 
 so you always pass through san juan in going to places like   or   .
i , um , 
and it's , i think what they do need is an infusion of some of the united states , um , privileges , some of our resources . the educational , the teachers , the , um , 
i don't think we do enough of a resource transfer , if there is such a thing . 
part of that though has been , i think , uh , selected by them ,
 there is a trade . 
they'll lose their ethnicity as they say , 
most of the people favor statehood ,
 or they have family here and this way they can go back and forth 
 and it's not that much of a strain , 
that's the way the pendulum seems to be swinging , right now . 
it sounds like you probably know qui , 
i mean to this day are you still in touch with any native puerto ricans that you have made friends with , 
it's just , 
that's natural , 
i just thought i'd ask that because i wondered what you thought they might think . 
because i really don't have any , um , personal or professional or familial ties down there . 
i don't know , probably the generation , yours and mine 
and the one right after us , um , their parents did not want to acclimate to the united states .
and my background's european heritage 
and their background it would be , you know , or latino heritage . 
not speaking in english , um , having the children drive them everywhere , and these were not old people . 
these were like in their early forties . 
 um , and that always bothered me 
and then there were some children that i noticed as soon as all the kids were out of high school , i mean they went back to puerto rico to live . 
you know , they had made enough money here . 
 and so th , 
 but on the other hand , i guess it's all about choice 
um , was it , 
i mean how were they toward , 
that's interesting term you used continentals , which i'm sure is the proper term . 
how were they toward the united states in terms of just general , relationships , 
i mean , were they glad ? 
there really were three major , um , camps , 
 and there were those who , uh , were very friendly , very open , any , anything we can do for you , uh , uh , 
either way , you know , was great . 
and then there were those at the other end of the spectrum and those that , ho hum , whatever ,
it was interesting , 
the whole time we were there it was very , very political . 
there was always some , on sunday afternoons , uh , going through the little neighborhoods with , uh , 
i can't think of the term 
but , you know . 
i know what you're talking about 
and with banners with their colors of the , 
 so they were very , very , um , passionate ,
but it kind of broke down that you couldn't really see , 
i couldn't see that there was a clear majority that stayed . 
it seemed to shift as , 
i don't predict , 
what you're describing is actually a conflict , very dif , 
hello , uh , 
i've got to go , because that's my cordless battery going . 
oh , oh , i see , 
i'm sorry .
well i have enjoyed it . 
i enjoyed talking to you 
and , uh , thank you for your time . 
 well , i think health care is real important , and dental coverage , 
but i guess medical insurance is probably what i consider the second most important . 
i agree on that . 
and , you know , it seems pa , 
compared to what our salary is 
i know 
 no matter what you do  about that , yeah , unless you're like a senior v p or something which i am not .
me either .
i know . 
it's , um , 
i don't know . 
and then when you interview for a job or something sometimes people , um , expect the benefits to take the place of a certain salary level . 
but then you know , ten percent to fifteen percent more are your benefits 
and if you're like , 
are you married ? 
um , like my husband works , 
and i do 
so i don't take some of , 
i have certain things that i take , 
and he has other things he takes . 
so i mean in that kind of situation it's really almost , redundant , you know , 
 you know that some of the benefits , i would rather have , um , money . 
money instead . 
more money , actually , um , 
i feel the same way , actually . 
um , we don't use any of t i s benefits other than and , um , that's it 
 you don't use the medical insurance ? 
you use your company's ? 
where does he work if you don't mind me , 
 he works for bramalea company , 
and they pay one hundred percent . 
not one dime is deducted from his check . 
oh , you're kidding . 
what's the name of that company  ? 
what do they do ? 
it's a security company 
they own a lot of buildings and lease buildings . 
are they a big company 
they're canada based . 
the , um , government run health care systems , social medicine . 
and you don't pay them . if you live there , 
it's like europe . 
you don't pay a dime . 
 you know ? 
it's all taken care ,
sounds wonderful . 
the only thing we pay for is  , if something happened , an emergency , and we had to have an ambulance , 
it's twentyfive dollars . 
i mean that's nothing . 
if i were ,
well , t i was getting , for the both of us , it was like seventyfive dollars a month .
oh , my goodness . 
i don't work at t i . 
my husband works at t i , 
but , um , 
but it's like , um , 
 you know they're both 
basically , e d s is a little bit better than t i 
and the medical i mean , i think it's terrible , you know ? 
but then they're getting ready to change it again for aetna . 
um , i don't know . 
i just don't think companies , um , they want you to feel responsible and don't abuse the medical system 
and , you know , 
we don't smoke , 
but do you know about the smoking premiums ? 
oh , yeah , 
yeah , 
do you guys smoke ? 
oh , yeah . 
neither one of us do . 
but then ,
and i hope , 
you know , who's going to croak first ? the people that smoke or , you know ? 
seems like ,
 i mean i'm not all for smoking at all , 
but you know , 
or something . 
it's like , 
i don't know . 
i mean i don't know , um . 
what other type of benefits do they have that , i mean , canadian based companies   .
they have to be a little bit different than the american , um . 
they are as far as their like pension plans    , 
they're vested a lot earlier . 
i think at t i , it took five years . 
t i is at least ,
five to seven . 
 and they're vested after their first year .
oh , my goodness . 
and they have the four one k and the 
that's kind of nice . 
t i has that , 
but that's a pretty standard thing anymore . 
 you know , um , um , husband's company probably matches more than t i , though . 
they match the same amount . 
oh , they do    ? 
it is . 
that's still pretty good , though . i mean the fact that your vested that quickly 
i know , um , 
e d s has eight years ? 
i think e d s has seven to eight years . 
 so it's like t i in that respect , you know ? 
 i mean , and i'm working for a company that's making money .
 you know , 
but i don't know . 
i think everywhere they just need to sit down and hire some people , the grunts , as i call them , like myself 
i mean , 
but if i were to rank them , i guess i would say next to income it's really just health benefits . 
and then , um , for most people i know it would be day care 
like t i has ,
and i know that's a big issue 
because i belong to a women's forum group . 
and some of the questions we're getting are on site day care and things like that . 
that they consider a very serious benefit . 
and i can't tell you anybody right now at t i that's , uh , considering that . 
oh , i don't , 
i would ,
they should be though . 
they really should because they're big enough , um , 
and the other thing i think is really good is that e d s is much better than t i at , i think , right now than , that we have day care , um , the health program 
but that it's developed as much as it could be for the size company as t i . 
i mean if you ever walked into e d s s health , corner court health clubs on site 
 a lot better . 
e d s is better than spring creek ? 
oh , it's really nice , 
oh , man . 
 you know , instead of like six , um , treadmills , you've got like twenty . 
 and e d s can't even compare in size .
oh , yeah . 
so i ,
i guess it's just where like e d s reimburses you for adoption . 
 oh , i see . 
 and t i doesn't have anything like that . 
you know , so i guess i wish the companies like t i and a lot of others were more progressive 
that's good . 
 that's a fortunate benefit , you know , that they're so active 
and i mean they have some strange things . 
i mean they have very strange like dress codes 
and , you know . 
um , uhhuh . 
 um , you can't wear slacks at the corporate site and that kind of thing 
but there aren't manufacturing environments because of the type of company it is . 
i guess i also wish that , uh , companies would look more at cost of living increases 
me , too . 
because , you know , with utilities and homes that are , uh , 
price of homes have 
like an average house is now a hundred and thirty thousand . 
and that is unreal ,
i know . 
but then we've got these million dollar homes 
i know . 
and how does your salary deal ,
it's not . 
and i mean , 
it's just not doing it . 
but i mean we have friends that laugh at us 
and we , i clip coupons . 
but , i mean , it's like , 
because you just can't , 
i mean , it seems like every time you try to get ahead and take a vacation or something 
that's true . 
that is exactly where we are . 
 i mean , 
 it's so strange  .
i know . 
i don't know what we're going to do about , 
common problem . 
i didn't say that . 
 i didn't say that on this line . 
i don't know . 
what else about corporate benefits ? 
i can't think . 
it's probably been too hot today for either of us to , 
um , kind of nice to talk to somebody in dallas . 
usually people are all over the country . 
and i think dallas , as far as , um , economic uncertainty , is better than what most of the country is . 
this is true . 
so somehow , we're better off than a lot of them . 
and that doesn't  definitely  make it any better . 
people are lucky to have jobs , 
and people are lucky to have any kind of benefits . 
when you see people that don't have , um , anything but h m o s or , you know , i mean really can't even afford to get in a job that costs , 
like , we had a guy fixing our air conditioner . 
and he said he didn't even make ten dollars an hour , 
and he has three kids . 
um , but benefits , 
i don't know . 
 um , the execution of their job . 
you know . 
empowerment issues . 
right yeah , 
that's a good word for it , um . 
how is t i in that mode ? 
well , very well , um , 
it's slow , though . 
at least they're making the effort to put it out there and make it available and 
and now it's kind of filtering down to the peon level . 
but , uh , i think they're really trying . 
it's going to take years , though . 
i mean it's that mindset ,
  all  part of a good old boy network , 
e d s oh , they're better , 
but they're a little bit too , um , stiff collared in terms of , you know , what you want to do . 
they're pretty much if that's where the widget goes , stick it in the hole , you know . 
they're kind of formula oriented . 
doesn't want to change . 
 and you can't really argue with them because they've always been successful 
well , i guess that's what i know about benefits . 
okay . yeah , 
okay  ? 
me , too . 
good talking to you . 
good talking to you 
 uh , i guess my feelings are that , uh , we almost have a universal health care system , uh , to a great degree , except that now i read where we've left out about thirtyfour million people . 
and , uh , i don't know exactly how we're going to cover many of these people , because i'm sure that some of them uh , don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves , 
so , uh , i have a feeling , since i have just about as good a health care coverage that anybody can get , that this , uh , then becomes an obligation of the government , 
because it's going to become an obligation of either state , local or federal government , anyway . 
because when people can't pay , they end up going to clinics or , you know , to public hospitals , and that kind of thing , 
and , you know , 
well , it seems to me or my insurance carrier , anyway , when i pay something , the bills seem inordinately high . 
oh , definitely . 
 and the reason that they're inordinately high is because that has ,
it would seem to spread it out a little better if the employers who , uh , employ these people , and pay them , uh , you know , subminimum wages or whatever ,
and myself , i guess . 
that sounds like a good idea . 
my only concern is what happens when you turn things over to the government , 
i don't know .
do they wind up with more red tape , and more problems then ? 
 i mean , it's worked successfully in europe . 
i've heard all these stories about , 
i travel extensively and spend , uh , maybe half a year in europe every year , 
and i find that the health care programs there , uh , are administered uh , at least people i talk to , with , uh , a great deal of integrity , 
and , uh , people don't seem to be reluctant to use them to any degree . 
as a matter of fact , if i'm injured or have an emergency when i'm , say in germany or france , uh , that , i'm automatically taken care of , 
i mean i don't even have to pay . 
well , i think part of the tremendous benefit of that is that there's so many people who wait now because they don't have the money , until , you know , they have no preventative measures .
people , um , you know , just go on and on and on . 
i mean , so many people don't even get prenatal care 
help available early on 
they're saying now that one out of every ten child born in public hospitals is addicted to crack . 
 well i , 
 well , you know  ? 
i have a solution , you see . 
my solution , 
even though i'm rapidly approaching i , 
my mother and father both , uh , uh , 
well , my father's not living but my mother is , 
and they are , um , of an advanced years , 
and when i see the money that's poured down the drain on medicare and medicaid , 
i mean , the ,
and the extraordinary amounts , 
i know that , 
because those people vote , 
i mean , they're the ones who get out and vote , 
that's what's robbing a poor mother of the prenatal care . 
the young people aren't getting the proper care that they need , and nutrition , i think , 
 and we're spending on these many times useless and inordinately complex unnecessary tests in hospitals for older people . 
 oh , it's unbelievable how much you go through . 
when i just had a problem with my neck and they ended up doing a seven hundred dollar cat scan , i mean , a chiropractor got it in one time  , 
that's right , 
i mean , it does ,
it was just strange . 
now i noticed just the other day in the paper payments will be based not , uh , just on cost , but on cost effectiveness . 
so i gue , 
oh , well , that should help . 
well , i don't know , uh , 
we'll see how that goes . 
i think that was just a regulation that was up for comment , 
but we'll see what happens . 
 oh i see .
oh , gosh . 
well , listen , uh , i think i've exhausted my , uh , self on , 
at least i've blown off steam of the way i feel about it . 
thank you . 
see you next time . 
i have only like two or three favorite television shows . 
i think one of my favorite then is from the guy stephen , is it brochco , who does like l a law 
oh , yeah . 
uhhuh , 
and , uh , he also did hillstreet blues . 
i like those type of shows . 
we really enjoy that too . 
uh , i don't get to watch a whole lot of t v . 
we have a couple of young children , 
and so 
and so it's usually the nine o'clock shows that if we get them in bed , we usually watch that , 
and l a law is one of my favorites . 
oh , yeah , 
me , too . 
i know , 
 uh , i think they're different than a lot of other shows of which they have like the re runs in the middle of the season 
 and then towards the end when everybody else is showing reruns , they start showing some of their newer stuff . 
 so i thought that was really interesting the way that they did that . 
oh , and so you must watch a lot of , uh , disney or cartoons then ? 
well , we have on sesame street and mister rogers , that kind of stuff , 
and i think those programs are really good for children . 
i know that both of mine have probably learned quite a bit from there . 
it's kind of nice to know that they're just going to be seeing , you know , not a lot of violence and that kind of stuff 
 and they usually , uh , show a lot of things that really teach them different things about the world . 
my older son , he's going to be five , 
and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now . 
oh , that's true , 
well , i noticed that , my kids are , uh , older now , 
but they did , 
we watched all of mister rogers and everything , 
but even some of your , uh , cartoons can be very violent 
 and , you know , they talk about death , 
and , we were watching , uh , oh gosh , bugs bunny just last night 
oh , yeah . 
 and , um , i think it was on , i have to remember which channel , 
but anyway , uh , we were watching that 
and it was talking about opera , 
and they showed like what they thought an opera would be , 
and one of the things was to kill the rabbit 
so he ended up killing the rabbit in the end , uh , 
and i thought , gee whiz , if a little kid was watching this , you know , that would be pretty violent even for a small child . 
well , yeah , 
and you know , especially boys , i mean , they're always talking about shooting and killing and all that kind of stuff 
 and i don't think that they really realize that death is forever , you know . 
and showing them something like that really doesn't 
that's right . 
well , i don't think cartoons portray that 
but like , 
and to get them to feel like that that's just pretend , i think 
a cat has nine lives 
 but they don't , 
they just have one like we do .
 oh , so that's really funny 
but , uh 
go ahead . 
i was just going to say , i know that , at least before our kids were born , we used to always enjoy watching the cosby show , 
thursday nights usually had pretty good , and as far as very good comedy . 
i like to watch designing women if the kids 
that's true , 
that's a good show . 
i used to watch , uh , dallas . 
we're in dallas . 
i used to watch dallas , years ago . 
and somewhere in the middle i got , uh , bored , 
in fact , i didn't even watch the finale . 
uh , you know , that's about how disinterested i had become . 
 well , i did watch it just to see what it was 
 and it wasn't really that great . 
well , actual , 
i think ,
they've done everything dirty in the book 
i know , 
was it actually based on a book ? 
well , no , 
i imagine , 
oh , but you were just talking about , 
everything you could think of , you know 
and i think maybe with dallas , as far as , they lost a lot of characters that had been around at the first . 
that's true , 
i don't know , 
i never watched knots landing , 
but i think they've had a lot of their characters stay around . 
stay . 
you know , and if you notice on dallas , they lost all the women . 
so the men mainly stayed 
but the women were the ones who left , 
and i thought that was very interesting and kind of wondered about that . 
uh , well , anyway that's a whole new issue .
 oh , goodness 
so . anyway . i don't know if our five minutes are over yet .
but uh , we also have the paid , uh , television channels . 
uh , the only thing i don't like about it , especially with teenagers , is all the violence , the sex , the nudity and the curse words 
and so , i know they didn't pick up these curse words from me . 
so , uh , they had to have picked them up from , uh , the t v . 
one nice thing though about the cable company we use , uh , they have that little parental , uh , uh , key , 
where you can lock up ,
so , i have that at home , 
and i keep the keys with me . 
and that's about the only way that i can do it . 
because their natural curiosity , you know , to go towards that way and want 
yeah . 
and i don't know the way the generations are growing up now , 
i mean i just think they watch so much more t v . 
i try to limit what they watch . 
they aren't sitting in the house watching t v all day 
and especially in the summer time we aren't in the house very much in the evenings . 
it's the only cool time to be outside .
that's true , 
well , and here lately it hasn't been that cool anyway with the humidity being so high . 
well , true , 
 well , it was nice talking to you . 
well , it was nice talking to you , too . 
talk with you later . 
um , is this something that concerns you ? 
especially because i just moved to massachusetts and , uh , they're having real problems because they have so many , uh , police layoffs . 
and , uh , personally i don't live in a real bad section of town 
but , uh , just because of the general area i live in , the insurance rates are real high on your car 
and , there's a lot of within a few miles of me .
how about you ? 
well , i live outside of dallas 
and it's kind of in a little suburb . 
so , i feel pretty safe out here 
but i know the murder rate is going up every year 
i , uh . 
and that worries me . 
i recently moved here 
and when i was looking for a job there was a lot of openings right in the worst areas of town 
and , uh , my husband , was , 
what his concerns were 
well not that i think you'll get involved in anything but it just be an innocent bystander , just to be in that location 
and i thought how sad it was 
 and a lot of kids , you know , are caught that way . 
there's a little boy just got shot and killed like last weekend down in what they call the projects , which is 
but he was just out riding his big wheel 
and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun 
and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet . 
that ex , 
that's really sad . 
so you know it must be frus , 
it'd be so scary . 
i know they asked in the topic for ideas on how to control crime 
and it doesn't seem like anything is working .
it really doesn't , 
it's kind of scary . 
 uh , i think the laws have gotten so lenient , you know 
the court systems are too lenient . 
i think that's part of the problem . 
 but , on the other hand they have to be because the jails are full . 
at least in this area , you know , they don't have any room to put anybody 
so a lot of people just get out , you know , back on the streets because they can't keep that many people in the buildings they have . 
they do that here , too . 
but i say , you know , they commit crimes let them be overcrowded , you know 
i know it , 
they have all sorts of rights , that , you know , are questionable . 
maybe they gave up that right when they committed the crimes . 
i think so . 
i think if they knew it was going to be really horrible , wherever they were going , maybe they'd think twice about doing it . 
that's true , 
maybe the punishment should be more severe . 
you know , the other thing that worries about it is , kids that are doing such bad crimes so young , you know , like eleven and twelve and thirteen year olds that just go out and kill 
i know it . 
i don't know if that's just a symptom of society and the breakdown of family and everything 
but that worries me , 
i wonder 
because they get involved in things so young that they don't really ,
and , uh , some people prey on that , you know , 
they'll take , uh , kids who don't really realize the seriousness even at fifteen .
well i don't know , 
i was watching a movie on t v , 
i don't know how true those can be , 
they'd steal cars and everything . 
so , i guess if they had ,
but the courts are so backlogged right now it takes forever just to go to trial . 
i think it would concern me even more if i had children , which i don't , 
because it seems like now , even in the country , you hear about bad things happening . 
it's true , 
 they talk about too , the gangs spreading , you know , 
like everybody thinks of them only in l a and new york 
but they spread out to cover more area 
and they've had some driveby shootings outside of the schools . 
the same in some of the areas around here 
but you know , i never met anybody that i knew had anything to do with it .
me either .
but , uh , that's a scary thing too because at that age kids want so much to belong to a group . 
 and , i think that a lot of people that sort of control whatever . you know , 
seemed like in the fifties when gangs were big 
it was just to be part of the gang 
but now they're so much into selling drugs 
it's pretty scary . 
it's true . 
and my god , the weapons that people have are , 
some people seemed to be armed better than the military or the same as the military . 
i don't know where they get them .
those machine guns and all that . 
that's scary . 
it's a wonder there's anybody who's willing to be a policeman anymore . 
that's the other thing , uh , 
 , it's hard to even , 
i can't even think of what the benefits of the job would really be . 
especially if you're an inner city , you know , you can't really feel like you're putting much of a dent in what's going on . 
and , you're putting your life on on the line everyday . 
they were saying in dallas that they can't hire anymore policemen 
but they keep losing them all the time 
and that , uh , you know , 
eventually we're going to be way short on the number we need because 
i just read an article yesterday , um , where this , what used to be a nice town in this area , they had a lot of budget cutbacks . 
massachusetts is broke right now 
and a lot of the towns are declaring bankruptcy 
and , they had to cut twenty guys from their forces 
and the crime wave rate went up almost instantly because it was so well publicized that everybody in the area knew that town wouldn't be patrolled as well . 
and so , 
 , they figure , what a heyday , huh .
this is a depressing conversation though .
it really is .
well , there's someone at the door 
so i guess i'll have to what my dog is barking about . 
but it was nice talking to you .
i hope things look up .
 well thanks 
same for you . 
where have you been on a wonderful vacation ? 
 well normally when we go on vacation we go home , to colorado . 
oh , that's where we go home , too . 
colorado springs is where we're from . 
that's where we go . 
how funny . 
my husband's family lives just off of academy boulevard at maize land . 
we live up , uh , lake , in the broadmoor area 
that's where my inlaws are . 
oh , we've been there . 
we haven't skied at broadmoor . 
we went there last year at christmas time 
and it was twentyseven below . 
so we had to cancel our ski lessons .
as of you can't even ski there anymore . 
oh , just this year ? 
oh , my , 
they don't have enough money 
it doesn't pay . 
so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation , now 
now colorado springs is real accessible to lake breckenridge 
it's only a couple of hours away . 
it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else . 
but , you can't ski up there any more . 
oh , i'd like to go on vacation . 
my husband and i want to go to florida 
but we have two little ones 
 so we want to wait until they're a little bit older 
well , we went on a family cruise last year , on the premier family cruise line 
and then we went to disney . 
it was all part of the package . 
and on the cruise ship they had mickey and minnie and chip and dale and goofy and donald duck , 
and it was really oriented toward little kids . 
well , how fun . 
so the kids could eat with chip and dale , you know , 
and , you know 
oh yeah , 
oh , i bet . 
so then we were on the cruise for days in the bahamas , 
and then landed at cape canaveral and then drove over to orlando and spent four days at disney . 
well that sounds pretty , 
that was the way to travel . 
and it was all a big package deal 
and kids are really cheaper , too . 
we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise , 
so they said we could either cancel , reschedule , or take whatever was available . 
so we took whatever was available , 
and we left a day early , 
and they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton , 
and the ship that was available , the only , uh , rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites . 
so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin . 
so then our cruise was actually extended a day , 
and our disney was extended a day , 
so we turned a seven day trip into ten 
 and they paid for everything . 
well , that's great . 
so that was a wonderful vacation . 
i bet . 
that sounds like the way i'd want to do it 
well , what kind of things do you like to do when you go to colorado ? 
oh , well , we like to ski , of course , 
so we spend so much time with our families 
because we moved to texas about two years ago . so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do 
 so we don't get a lot of time to just vacation . 
we did , um , last year , though , go to san antonio for memorial day 
uh , but , you know , with both my kids being under two , it's real hard 
that would be , 
i know , 
i think one of the places i always hit in colorado , is that current outlet store . 
that's what , 
i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it . 
oh , with the santa claus on the cover . 
i've already ordered from that one , 
but we will probably be going up at thanksgiving this year , 
oh , where do you , 
what state are you in ? 
oh , you're in texas . 
i'm in the dallas area .
so am i . 
i'm in garland . 
i talked to somebody from wisconsin or something the other day . 
so i guess they get people from all over . 
driving for thanksgiving , that's going to be quite a drive for , 
well it was when we left last year . 
we left on the eighteenth , right before that big snow storm hit colorado 
 and we pulled in just as it hit . 
so , how do you go ? 
do you go up through the raton pass , when you go up there ? 
uh , no , 
ret , oh , 
well , wait a minute , 
that's on like route two eightyseven or something like that . 
and then we go straight up through trinidad 
we , uh , went a different way when we went last christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little u haul trailer , 
because we had to take our dog in the car , there was no room for luggage . 
so , we went all interstate . 
we went up , um , through oklahoma city 
 and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour . 
it was a little more mile wise 
 but because you could go sixtyfive miles an hour on the , 
actually i'm in plano , too .
that's okay . 
i say dallas area when i'm talking to people elsewhere . 
that's okay , 
it's more , uh , concentrated , so they know where you are . 
uh , anyway , i know here in plano some of the things that we do are , um , kroger 
and some of the other stores , too , have said , if you bring your bags back to the store to recycle , then they'll pay you a certain amount of money , 
and that's one thing that started in the community . 
they actually pay you money for that ? 
um , um , brookshires up in uh , allen , uh , you bring uh , the plastic bags back or the paper bags , you put them in the receptacles there , 
but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that . um . 
i know kroger will do it , 
and i think albertson's does it sometimes , 
i'm not sure . 
um , the , uh , community , like through the schools 
so , um , that's always helpful , 
and i know that different can banks around the city 
um , one of the ways , 
i don't know , uh , if this would be helpful . 
and i don't know if it would be helpful or not , 
but i know on monday , the garbage men pick up like just , um , any limbs or any extra trash that you might have , 
and that might be an extra day to put out things that might be recycled if we had a certain colored can to put them in or something in the city to put , like either glass or newspapers or whatever . 
i think they already do that out east . 
um , it's a little bit more difficult , because people have to remember , okay , today's glass 
 but i think that's the way we need to go . 
 uh , it's pretty bad . 
all these years we've 
 uh , the plastic and the paper and everything , we just used to throw out . 
uh , i know getting a newspaper everyday , i know i could just , you know , do that 
and it just goes out with our trash , 
and i guess i'm not as , um , recycling minded as i should be  , 
but that goes out with the trash , 
and it really could be recycled . 
about six months ago i started 
did you ? 
tell me . 
it's not bad , 
you just have to have a place to keep everything , 
but , uh , you'll be amazed if you ever start doing it . 
just put your paper in the same place every day , 
and it'll start stacking up . 
take your glass , um , you know , pickle jars , or whatever , uh , liquid jars , you know , 
just rinse them out a little bit 
and put them all in a place , 
and , uh plastics , 
don't you have to take like labels off of those jars ? 
i don't scrub them or anything , 
i just tear them off 
throw the lids and everything out , 
but , uh , put all the glass in one place , and plastics , like milk jugs , uh , orange juice jugs , things like that . 
both liter sodas 
can you do that . 
um , and then , of course , uh , cans , coke cans , whatever . 
but , uh , i haven't been down to the recycling center yet to find out exactly what they need or what they take , and all that , 
i've just read a lot about it , 
and i'm keeping these big piles of it right now  , 
i going to try to dump it out this weekend in fact . 
but , uh , you'd be amazed how quickly   it all stacks up . 
there's a lot that we throw out . 
i know with our family that we could really be helpful if we could find a way to just , um , get it into different categories like that , 
i have two older ones that probably would go along with if i had it arranged so that it wasn't a big project , you know . 
 yeah , it's not a big deal . 
you get used to it . 
and they told me , they look through them all and throw out the ones that don't belong there and then , you know , go and recycle the rest . 
and what i found out is , if you look at the bottom of those bags , kroger or whatever 
and if it's got the little recycle symbol inside it it's got a number , like bags from drug emporium have a  . . . 
it took forever to find somebody . 
oh , well i'm glad you found me . 
well my name's gail , 
and i guess we have to ,
my name is carolyn . 
well , if you're ready , then uh , 
i'll just let you start , 
well , i'm not , 
this is kind of an interesting subject to come up for me , because credit cards are my downfall . 
i just find it so easy to charge something when i don't have the money to pay for it , 
and i'm really trying to get out of that habit . 
so . i think they're kind of dangerous . 
i think they are , too . 
and , unfortunately , um , we don't use them all the time , 
but we use them like at christmas time , 
and then it seems like it takes all year to pay them off when you use them like that .
but , um , i would love to just take some scissors and cut them in half . 
me too . 
i think sometimes when you look at the interest that you're paying on them , um , that's what gets to be the really scary part , you know , if you think , when it comes around to income tax time , and you look at how much money you paid out just in interest all year , 
you could really get a lot more stuff 
that's true , 
that's true . 
seems just like our society um , pushes so hard for , you can have it , you know , and then no interest , no payments for a year , and stuff like this , 
they're really trying to get you into that situation , because they know they've really got you 
all i know is some of my credit cards , 
like , um , we have a sears one , 
and we always get a maintenance agreement every year 
well that's probably four or five hundred dollars , you know , that goes on at that point 
 and then it seems like takes forever to pay that off . 
it's funny , that we've got a sears card , and we bought a washer and dryer on it , four years ago , and we still owe . 
i mean , i think like half the amount that they cost in the first place . 
it's just , uh , you know , you never get it out , 
and now that's real irritating . 
it sure is . 
we eventually did , 
one time we just took a personal loan and paid off all our credit cards , 
and the interest on the loan was cheaper 
we haven't done it lately . 
we probably need to do it again . 
well , we did , you know , 
one time , we wanted to buy a used truck , 
and so we went down to the bank , 
it was only a thousand dollars that we needed 
and it's going to be a lower payment than it was for all of them , 
you only have to write one check a month , not all those . 
you never miss one or whatever 
 and we did that , 
but we didn't realize at the time , until several months later , that we were real , 
i mean this was three years ago , 
we were pretty young 
and we were just kind of like , 
well , i guess that means these credit cards are closed , 
and we didn't , you know , 
about six months later we realized we could use them , 
and so we charged them all up again . 
oh , no . 
so then we were not only paying those bills regular like we were before , but also adding the lower payment for all of them , .
so we were paying like twice . 
um , so we didn't ever make that mistake again , luckily .
but , uh , we're definitely working on not doing that credit thing . 
we just , 
as a matter of fact , it's real interesting the subjects i get . 
they always seem to be so pertinent . 
but we just discussed this last night at church , talking about debt and things like that . 
it's so alluring , and 
uh , sometimes , 
i know , 
they really encourage you not to go into debt for anything except for maybe your house and 
and , uh , if you could stick to that , you know , we'd get rid of a lot of indigestion and 
that's true . 
oh , i just picked up my daughter 
and she was eating a cupcake and now her crumbs all over . 
oh , dear . 
what a mess you are . 
oh , so i don't know , i just feel kind of . 
my big thing was my husband really wanted to get rid of our visa card , 
and i just thought , you know , if we ever had something go wrong with our refrigerator or something , you know 
and then we weren't smart enough to not use it , 
you know , one thing you might do with , in a situation like that , though , it's just like keep , 
so you're into microwave cooking . 
and it's , uh , especially when people are working just to come home and pop something into the microwave 
and it be ready in just a few minutes .
   , yes , 
something that we can just cook in a hurry after we get off work . 
i've gotten in the habit of cooking something big on the weekends so that i have leftovers all week . 
all week . 
well , we've done that , too . 
there's just my husband and i , 
and uh , pot of spaghetti 
 and , you know , we're eating it for a week and a half , 
and i kind of get sick of it after he   .
i know . 
i try not to make too much . 
it's just my husband and i , too 
 and i try not to make so much that it lasts more than that week 
 but , uh , i usually like to make spaghetti or soup or chili or , you know , something like that 
what's your favorite thing to cook if you're having a dinner party ? 
um , i have a great recipe for sour cream chicken enchiladas 
oh , oh . 
 it's really good , 
i got it from a friend of mine that i used to work with 
 and , uh , every time i've served it , everybody just loves it . 
that sounds delicious . 
so that's one of my favorite things to make . 
what about you ? 
i end up with an old standby that we call russian chicken , because it's so easy 
 and , uh , it go , 
you have to cook very little to go with it , just some rice and some salad 
and that's about it , you know . 
well , what do you put in it ? 
uh , you just take your boneless chicken breasts 
and then you take and make a dressing out of , uh , russian dressing , one bottle of that 
that sounds good . 
 and you mix it up , 
and you just put it on the top of the chicken , 
and then i cover the pan with foil and put it in the oven for about an hour 
 and then i take the foil off and let it brown 
 and it's delicious 
that sounds good . 
 and it's so simple , because i can pop it in when i come in the door , you know , and then , uh , go about my business , 
and by the time i've got everything else ready , the chicken's done . 
is done , 
so that's a real easy thing for me . 
that sounds good , too . 
i've got um , a great recipe for cheese cake . 
oh , really . 
i don't know if you get southern living , 
my mom gets that , 
they have one , 
if you like to cook , they have , 
every recipe i've tried out of that has been a really good one 
 and , um , you know , every month they've got all different kinds of recipes , 
but , i got one in there about a year or so ago on cheese cake , 
and it's just a regular cheese cake , 
and then you can put raspberry , uh , topping on it 
 but inside the cheese cake , uh , recipe you put , um , lemon peel and orange peel 
 and it's just enough to taste it , you know , when you're eating the cheese cake , 
and it is wonderful , 
but it takes a long time , because you have to cook it for fortyfive minutes , and then you turn the oven off , and you leave it in the oven for another fortyfive minutes 
oh , my goodness . 
 so sometimes i'll do that overnight , and then put the topping on the next day , 
but it's very good . 
well , i love cheese cake . 
i have never been , i don't know , the ones 
i have not done that well with . 
i like a baked cheese cake , you know , 
i don't , 
i have had a recipe that someone has given me that it's kind of like you just mix cream cheese and stuff 
 but that's not the same as a new york style 
no  , 
it's not . 
and , uh , the recipes that i've used , 
and then i make it , 
and it's really not very good 
 but yours sounds good . 
i bet that lemon and orange peel gives it a little bit of tartness . 
it does , 
and it is really good . 
um . well , that sounds interesting , 
so there's your good dessert for your dinner party . 
 are you into serving wines with your dinner party ? 
me , either . 
i wish i knew more about it . 
i've been to , you know , some wine tastings up in napa valley 
 um , you know , and i learned a little bit about them then , 
they would be , if you just had time to do it . 
and then there's places , um , 
do you live in dallas 
there's places here that , um , offer , 
i think it's like once a month , 
you can go to a particular restaurant or whatever , 
and you can kind of take a cooking class 
 and then you get to eat everything afterwards , 
and then they also go into the wines , you know 
well , how neat . 
and it sounds like it's a lot of fun . 
we have some friends done that , 
and they've really enjoyed it . 
um , well , i didn't even know they were offering that . 
i guess i , 
this place is called like medina's or 
oh , well , i bet that would be a fun thing to do . 
like it , 
my kids are both in college , um , 
and i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go . 
on the other hand , they really decided themselves . 
um , what kind of experience did you have ? 
well , i , uh , 
one girl went in state and has graduated , 
and then , uh , uh , you know , that was her choice pretty much where she wanted to go 
 and i have , uh , two out of state , both in missouri , 
and , um , i teach , uh , in a college , 
and so they had heard me talk about it , and for years , that i didn't think it really made too much difference where they went for their undergraduate . 
uh , so , that was 
i see , 
well , maybe i'm wrong , 
but i think it makes a big difference in terms of finding a school that is sort of right for the child in terms of his or her happiness and , 
oh , oh , if they're content there , 
i mean as far as the education , as far as looking at the degree at the end , very little difference is paid 
uh , if it's a halfway decent school 
and if they can get , uh , um , two out of , 
let's see , my son got a full total scholarships 
 and so uh , there's plenty of scholarships out there , 
and so people should be advised to look for those , 
and , um , 
a strong role in helping them pick schools 
or 
well , they , uh , 
 we went around , 
my son was a , graduated from a jesuit high school 
 and so he was pretty much looking for a jesuit university , 
and so there 
that was limited to five or six different places 
 um , so he's in saint louis u , 
and i guess i played a role in that . 
i just sort of , uh , let them , um , you know , 
they'd all been , uh 
and , uh , so i didn't have that much to do , 
and i , you know , helped them get there as far as 
we did do that , 
and i would suggest a person always goes and looks at the school before they sign up . 
i think that's a great idea , 
i mean , that , 
some people don't do it , 
and then they get there and hate it , or whatever , 
 but the 
i think in the short run it is expensive . 
in the long run it's very , uh , reasonable 
my daughter has been in missouri for a second year , 
now she's coming home at the end of the semester 
 so , uh , you know , she's already twentyone . 
she started late . 
so that's , you know , strictly up to her , 
and , uh , she'll uh , uh , finish this year down here and then decide what she's going to do next year . 
it'll save me a lot of money because i'm not going to have to pay out of state tuition 
 but again , that's her decision 
 uh , but i have so many students in my classes that have dropped out and come back , 
and they're much better students at twentyfive , twentysix , may , twentyeight . 
so , you know , i never have pushed them . 
i just say that education is important , you should do it , uh , 
but , uh , they have to do the work 
 so , uh . 
well , back to this visiting thing , 
i mean , i found that my kids had no conception what college was really like 
 and being able to go with them to at least some of them 
oh , i think so . 
and also i'm opposed to the size . 
they've just gotten so huge , 
and so my daughter first looked at a place that was forty thousand , 
see that's just too many . 
good grief .
ended up going to where i used to go , 
and that was twentyfive hundred when i went there , 
it's twentyone thousand , now 
it's too big . 
good grief . 
what is twentyone thousand ? 
what school is that ? 
it's southwest missouri state university 
 and , uh , it was twentyfive hundred when i went there forty years ago , 
and , uh , my son's in a school about seven thousand , 
and that's not bad 
i teach in a school about eight thousand , 
and that's even a little large 
 but it's much better than twentyone thousand . 
but they do have to visit , if the parent can point out all the different places to look for 
and then , oh , those rating , uh , 
the magazines and all those things are doing the ratings now and everything , 
i don't think it hurts to look at them 
i don't put that much stock in them , 
probably fine just to compare . 
helps to at least set up 
if you know , uh , they need to , 
who do you like ? .
i like just about any kind except country and western . 
that's the same with me . 
it's , course country 
and western even i've gotten a little bit used to because it's not like it used to be . 
like clint black , he's pretty good , 
and who's the other big guy ? 
well , in oklahoma we say garth brooks .
garth brooks , 
 yeah , that's the other guy i was thinking of was garth brooks . 
in fact i think both of them have performed here . 
and kenny rogers , he's kind of country verge , you know 
of course , garth brooks lives about , uh , you know , 
his home town is about , uh , fifteen minutes away 
oh , wonderful . 
 so he's a home boy .
well , then , of course you like him . 
that's great . 
but , well , i have teen age children , 
and so , you know , i'm , hear the rock music , not the hard rock , but the , you know , michael bolton type stuff . 
he's my personal favorite . 
my son is , uh , twentyeight , 
he's real unusual in that , uh , 
he likes a little bit of every kind . 
he likes jazz 
oh , that's good . 
 i can't say he's real crazy about elevator music , as he calls it . 
actually , we don't listen to any elevator music at my house . 
but i've got teenagers , 
well , my teenagers are all gone . 
i can listen to any music i want to .
that's good , 
 uh , our public radio station has wonderful classical music . 
it's just very wonderful . soothing , and , you know , uh , lot of symphonies 
and , i love that , 
that's probably my alltime favorite . 
you know , uh , i teach 
 and we can have music in the classroom , 
but you know , it can't be the rock or anything like that 
 and i find that the classical music is very good for the kids too , it doesn't disturb them and 
what do you teach , what grade ? 
well , it's nine through twelve 
good for you . 
a certain subject ? 
well , it's , uh , business technology . 
good for you . 
but , uh 
i was just sitting here while she was trying to find , another caller , uh , 
i was reading 
my husband and i are taking a computer class at our junior college .
 oh , boy , 
it's pretty good , 
it's just a real basic class , 
but we're learning a lot , 
and we have a home computer , 
so it's very interesting . 
uh , yeah , 
i'd learn it too . 
uh , i guess we'd better get back to music , though . 
the subject of music .
i , uh , 
do you play any instruments ? 
and right now my nine year old is taking piano , 
and i just got a whole mess of music , 
volunteer to play the piano at the children's christmas program for the whole grade school , which is k through six 
ooh , you took on a , 
good job . 
 i did it last year , 
i just sub at the school , 
i don't want to work full time , 
so i just sub at the school , 
and that's kind of my volunteer thing , 
so it's really neat , 
and my older daughter plays the saxophone , 
my next son plays the drums , 
and my third son just started baritone this year , 
and my little girl will start french horn next year , 
oh , well , my son played the sax and drums , my daughter the piano , organ and french horn . 
french horn is absolutely wonderful instrument . 
it's just my favorite . 
of course that's what i played , 
and so i'm pushing that on my daughter because i want to play in our city band , not the symphony , with just the city band 
oh , okay . 
and i get a little bit more time . 
right now i'm busy chasing my kids . 
sounds like you've got a houseful . 
but we have a marvelous band instructor , 
he's wonderful . 
we have , uh , couple of hundred kids in the band , 
our junior high band is just wonderful . 
oh , that's a , 
he , lot , 
and their concert band , 
and then he has a jazz band that my older daughter was in , 
and my son will be in next year 
i mean , they play college level music in junior high , 
he's that good of an instructor , 
and the kids just love him . 
oh , that's wonderful , 
so it's really good . 
it is wonderful . 
totally a tin ear 
oh do you .
 and i love music . 
i cannot carry a tune in a basket . 
i know what i like , 
but i 
 you know , and i love to listen to it , love to sing , and my kids , when i was little and , they were little 
and i was singing to them . 
oh , i guess , uh , this is a topic near and dear to my heart ,
 well , i try to be as well , 
 well , uh , i , 
there really isn't any kind of particular food that don't like really , 
and i like a good italian restaurant 
especially like good prime rib 
 so it's , uh , nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that , 
and i live here in , uh , rome , new york , 
and there are a lot of good restaurants around here . 
oh , you're in new york , 
i was going to , 
there's a place , if you ever make it to dallas 
it's called lawry's , like lawry's seasoning salt 
 and it is absolutely wonderful . 
and , uh , we were there a few months ago , 
and i mean , it's kind of pricey , 
well , from new york it probably doesn't matter , 
oh , no , 
i'm in upstate new york , 
and it's actually very inexpensive , 
there's a 
oh , is it , okay . 
so that , 
well , i think the cheapest there probably starts at eighteen , 
and it includes , you know , salad and rolls and , oh , some other stuff , 
it's the best i have ever had . 
uh , i was going to this place up the street from me is the best i've ever had , 
well , uh , lots of people down here like mexican food 
 so , um , that's , 
i think italian and mexican food are probably my favorites . 
but , um , i'm not into sushi or any of that kind of stuff . 
i'm raw fish like that , 
but i do like , uh , like raw bar like oysters and things like that , uh 
 they , uh , 
i go on , 
i'm an officer in the air force and travel quite a bit on business 
oh , okay . 
 so i , uh , find myself down in melbourne , florida about once every two months or so 
oh , yeah 
 but , i love that , 
fresh seafood down there , 
um , and , uh , maryland's great , 
you get the crabs 
it's like , i can't go anywhere 
seafood seems to be than other types of food . 
that's true . 
but it sure is good , 
and it's supposed to be good for you . 
well , uh , it's really strange resource of food 
and yet , we as human beings , haven't figured out a way to harvest it economically 
 so , we managed to , uh , figure out how to get at just about everything else , uh , 
do you like spicy foods 
and around here the big spicy thing is like , uh , buffalo wings 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and so , uh , they , you know , 
you go out to get the chicken wings 
and those are really hot 
well , uh , we like spicy food down here , especially , uh , the hot sauce , picante sauce , or salsa 
 and , uh , we sure go through a lot of that .
but i like it hot , 
but i don't like it real hot 
my scalp will start , 
i can feel just the top of my scalp getting hot ,
but , uh , i don't know , 
but , uh , 
well , there isn't too much in the way of restaurants that i don't like . 
things that are kind of oddball , like , uh , thai cuisine , 
i never been really fond of that stuff . 
you talk about spicy , 
that'll literally blow your head off , 
it's so hot . 
uh , and i can handle just about any kind of food without , uh , um , 
well , but goes one notch beyond , uh , 
so . although i guess on this topic are to talk about the , uh , service in a restaurant is always nice though , too 
oh , yeah , 
 that's one thing , 
 and the price . 
what's that ? 
well , i find that lately that so many people are you know , working waitressing jobs or waiter , 
go ahead . 
um , i haven't given this a lot of thought . 
i'm , uh , practice that is they , 
 uh , i don't , 
 you would favor  invasions of privacy on the other hand that's arguable but that , uh , people who's jobs are critical to public safety should have to meet special standards . 
uh , i haven't given this matter enough thought . 
do you work for t i ? 
no , uh , 
i'm in the washington area . 
i work for  n i s t  .
oh , okay . 
oh , all right . 
well , see we have the testing already here . 
we've had it for , oh , about five years . 
it used to just be for new employees . 
and now 
 and now , 
they , uh , randomly select employee numbers 
and , uh , the day that they select you is when you have to go and be tested . 
and how do people feel about it ? 
 so , we're familiar with it . 
oh , we have a lot of , um , people upset about it at the beginning . some not all . 
but what was happening at t i is that they found certain parts of the company there was a lot of drug abuse . um , mainly the areas where they were doing a lot of , um , manufacturing type things 
and what they ended up doing is , uh , kind of like doing a little bit of an undercover agent to watch what was happening , 
and we had people using on the premises and actually selling and dealing , you know , on the premises . 
well , okay , 
that's a very different issue . 
 well , yeah , 
it was , you know , combination uh , and using too 
so they developed this , uh , drug policy uh , to eliminate , 
there's some parts of the company that we do , uh , government contracts , 
and i think some of those require the drug testing , 
and that we shouldn't have , um , people on drugs within our , you know , offices and such . 
i haven't personally ever been tested , 
but i don't have a problem with it . 
um , does the testing cover alcohol as well as illegal drugs ? 
but one thing that to me was , um , going on , stretching it a little too far was that they also check , um , if you are taking somebody else's prescription drug . 
you know , it happens a lot of times 
like some member of the family gets the flu or whatever 
and , you know 
  well   , 
well , according to what they do at t i , if you take a prescription drug it has to be in your name . 
 you know , it can't be in your spouse's name 
so i mean , the testing will look for , i guess , any kind of drugs , 
and you have to tell them what they are taking a prescription for . 
so they ask you to declare beforehand what prescription drugs you are taking ? 
when you get tested you are supposed to tell them , you know , everything that might be there . 
and then if they ever , um , question you or something you may have to show proof that you do have a prescription in your name . 
well , they don't routinely test for very many prescription drugs 
 but they  don't say in advance   , uh , 
 well , what they be testing for are the ones that would have like , you know , barbiturates or codeine things like that in them . 
the ones that would kind of constitute controlled substances or something  anyway  .
i guess that's what antibiotics and stuff . 
they would be looking for the , yeah , controlled things , barbiturates amphetamines . 
 so what they are asking you to tell them is all the prescription drugs you are taking which are controlled substances . 
you pretty much , you know , put down what you remember even if it was just contact or something like that . 
but afterwards , uh , maybe if you had a controlled substance .
is contact a , 
you probably put down , you know , you had  drixoral  or contact if you would remember that you did it . 
is contact a ,
but if they had a controlled substance , maybe they would ask you then to show that you had that prescription in your name . 
i know i had one contract employee through manpower was not a t i person ,
and they test them too even if you are not a real , uh , t i er . 
if you are a contract employee here 
and he had taken some kind of , um , oh , you know , uh , 
just , he had some kind of flu or something . 
he got a real bad migraine 
and he took his mother's , 
what is your favorite show ? 
well , i was just trying to think . 
when they called , i didn't have as much time to prepare for this as i did some of the others . 
um , i love watching some of the , uh , new shows basically . 
and we subscribe to c n n 
and we took that , 
and we started watching a lot of those especially during the war or during anything kind of thing like the earthquake , 
and i have gotten stuck on a lot of this . 
the new shows and the stuff that comes on it , you know , 
like uh , at night the discussion talk shows and things . 
and we really haven't gotten a lot into the sitcoms that are current , uh , especially with the kids here because we have to kind of filter it before they get here . 
we have little ones . 
uh , we do let them watch nine one one , 
 and we think that's kind of informative to teach them ,
it really is . 
what do you watch ? 
i watch just about anything ,
i mean i'll watch , you know , maybe a little while when i first get home in the evening . 
and i usually watch , you know , the news 
and then i'll watch that hard copy or 
that's the same thing we do . 
and i like the nine one one ,
that's the kind i like really more than ,
i haven't gotten ,
now , i do , 
my husband is really crazy about evening shade that comes on monday evening . 
i have heard that's real good . 
and i ,
i've heard that . 
and i've got to where every monday i rush around so i could sit and watch that with him because it's really funny . 
now someone told me that 
and also , uh , i meant to be trying to pick up on murphy brown ,
well , his favorite night is monday night 
so we've got to where we will sit ,
you've got to yeah , 
 and then that , uh , oh , 
i can't even think of the name of it . 
like i say i'm not , 
designing women is on that night ,
and the one with the sergeant that married the woman with the kids , sergeant  mcgillis  .
huh , i don't even know . 
sergeant , uh , major dad . 
oh , okay . 
now i ,
that comes on right after , uh , the evening shade and then murphy brown ,
so he watches that 
and i watch the first one then kind of sit in on the others ,
on the others . 
well , you know , on friday nights especially , we like to watch twenty twenty . 
or , um , 
it's kind of a competition on thursdays between prime time and knots landing . 
but , uh , we used to like knots landing a lot . 
oh , excuse me just a minute .
the money is right there on the thing and the coupon . 
well , you can't hardly watch knots landing with the little kids around though . 
oh , i know . 
that's the thing . 
and so , 
except they , 
well , they are . 
in fact , on weeknights they are in bed by eight , 
but we have just gotten any more that where we just keep it off . 
did you get your pizza taken care of ? 
thank you .
um , but i was   to say on saturdays there is absolutely nothing 
and that's the day my husband ,
 well , do you know , 
i have picked up a show lately on saturday night that i've really liked 
and that's sisters . 
have you watched that ? 
and it sounds like it's not fluff . 
it sounds like it's good . 
 you know , it's really pretty good . 
 i mean , it's kind of like , you know , um , soap opera i guess . 
that's what they said it was kind of ,
 but it's a , 
so far i've watched it about three times now 
and it's really held my attention . 
it's been pretty good . some ,
 well , and a , 
and you are wanting to cocoon more , 
that they said is excellent is the i'll fly away and brooklyn bridge . 
some of these ,
now i watched , 
did you , 
 but i haven't , 
i liked it . 
did you ? 
well , they said that one and i'll fly away are really quality , you know 
now i haven't seen i'll fly away yet . 
i haven't seen it either . 
i think what i need to do is kind of read to see what is on these days because by the time we get the kids in bed at eight o'clock and then i get my bath 
it's nearly , 
that's the way i am . 
i get in , 
and i'm tired 
and i sit and watch for a few minutes 
so i have to get up and do dinner ,
and then we've gotten to where we rent videos for weekend nights . 
 so , it's like , 
that's us . 
if we are home on the weekend , we always watch videos , 
 well , we do too . 
but there are some good shows on . 
 i really probably should watch more of them than i do . 
 but i like , 
i don't know 
i'm always in to making things 
i don't know , 
there's a lot more to do with , 
and my husband , now he sits and watches t v constantly . 
well , and her husband do on weekends . 
they don't have children yet , 
and they just turn it on when they walk in , 
they turn it off when they leave . 
so they are used to that too . 
i could be around here for hours myself and never have it on . 
i understand . 
same here . 
 uh , but there are some really good new shows that i have enjoyed , 
and i'll have to watch that i'll fly away this week . 
it's real good . 
and then of course , in the afternoons if i get in from work in time i watch oprah , some of those ,
i like her . 
i never get in in time for any of those . 
yeah . 
well , it's nice talking to you . 
i guess we've kind of exhausted this one , 
but it's nice talking with you . 
well , it's nice talking with you . 
thank you . 
uh , i guess it's , uh , 
watching on , uh , crime . 
in our state right now , uh , recently they've had a lot of , uh , uh , the rapists , uh , murder type , uh , killers going around 
oh , gracious . 
they've caught them 
and they're in there . 
wasn't it your state that had the , uh , guy that committed all those murders ? 
there was that , uh , 
well , yeah , 
that was really on the national news a lot . 
we heard a lot about that in texas . 
so that's , 
well , i live right on the border of minnesota and wisconsin 
so i kind of get both news 
and , i know , in minnesota , uh , they had , uh , the one that just , uh , got out and went after a , uh , college student and raped ,
and they are not too happy about that now , i guess , 
well , i can imagine . 
 there  .
it seems like the violent crimes are increasing a lot to me . 
i don't know . 
i don't know if statistically they are 
but it seems like maybe you just hear a lot more about them on the news 
i don't know . 
uh , that's hard to say for sure . 
don't it just for the publicity 
you wonder about that sometimes . 
and they become big celebrities . 
that's kind of scary . 
i wish there was some way that we could change the news media so they didn't feature these way out stories . 
maybe it wouldn't give other people ideas . 
do you have it up there ? 
i see . 
see i no , i , 
do you think that's a deterrent ? 
and that's , 
 and there are a lot of repeaters . uh , 
i guess that's another thing that to me is a real problem , 
and i know we have got so many people in our system now , at least here in texas 
 i mean , they are really in a crisis . 
there has been times they have had to just close off the prisons and leave them in county jails or whatever because there just wasn't enough room for all of them . 
and a lot of them they put out on parole 
and then some of the ones that they put out early , you know , do repeat offenses 
well , some , i'm just wondering a lot of times they will put , uh , people , lesser crimes in , uh , with , uh , people that did more severe crimes 
than maybe they just tend to learn from these people 
and when they get back out , they just go into worse crimes . 
i think that could be true too . 
maybe they should try and separate them a little bit more . uh , 
i think the whole parole thing , you know , if somebody is convicted of seconddegree murder or something gets fifteen years , well , they are out in six or seven . you know ,  outbound on  the streets again .
and to me that's really scary . 
some of these crimes that they commit , you know , seems like the punishment is not really equal to the crime . 
well , uh , i don't know are the answer . 
if you want to stop the crime , i think you've got to get , uh , the people when they are kids . 
oh , yeah . 
a lot of this probably just starts uh , 
all these , uh , gory movies on there becomes , uh , just a natural fact of life . 
they think it's okay thing to do . 
yeah , 
i think that's a very good point . 
you know , i , 
there's a lot more working mothers , a lot more kids in day care centers all that kind of thing . 
morality is being taught more by the schools a lot of times than in the home anymore . 
well , a lot of the european countries , uh , they tend to sensor , 
well , they probably won't sensor so much the sexual stuff as much as the violent . 
and they have a lot less crime . 
and be safe . 
uh , even , uh , i think new zealand is one of the places , uh , that , 
well , sid , 
have you established what kind of requirements you are looking for your next vehicle ? 
 a lot of , uh , requirements . 
uh , i guess i look at , uh , getting the best deal . 
uh , that's my main objectives normally . whoever is willing to deal and give me a good price . 
well , i tend to be more methodical i guess . 
uh , i determine first of all what i'm going to use the vehicle for , whether it's going to be primarily as a family mover or as or local mileage more often . 
and , uh , hanging in the back of my mind is always the knowledge that i tend to drive cars for about ten years and a hundred fifty to two hundred thousand miles . 
so i'm real picky . 
if you are going to keep something that long , you know , you better get something that you wanted to begin with and that you are going to like for a long time . 
i don't know i've had pretty good luck , you know , 
even and you care for it well enough , uh , you are going to get some good life out of it . 
uh , my oldsmobile right now that i have , uh , is getting near eighty thousand 
and it's still in pretty good shape . 
uh , there was a flaw in there where a head gasket bolt broke , 
and it cost me some bucks to fix that 
but that was , you know , something that was unforeseen . 
but i still think i'm going to get probably a hundred fifty thousand or more out of it . 
well , it sounds like you tend to drive your cars quite a ways also then . 
well , uh , but not from pasadena 
but , uh , 
uh , it's a pretty big expense nowadays . 
uh , and i guess i like to take care of it , uh , 
so i don't have to buy one too often . 
that's true . 
uh , do you have more than one vehicle in your fleet ? 
uh , do you have a family fleet 
so i just keep running the thing . don't want to sell it or get rid of it until it quits , 
but it just doesn't seem to want to . 
i'll probably have , uh , three , four hundred thousand before it wants to die . 
well , that may be . 
 chrysler made some really good old engines back then 
like the three eighteen was particularly an exceptionally good engine . 
 oh .  i've got the big three sixty in there , gas guzzler 
but it runs good . 
at the moment i've got , uh , cadillac  cimarron  which is approaching its tenth year of age and a , uh , reasonably new plymouth voyager . 
it's only a couple of years old . 
but that's the second one of those that we've had , 
and that's the family travel vehicle . 
you know , not only does it do all the , uh , carpooling around during the week , 
but it's also the vacation vehicle that we all drive in . 
i think that what i'm getting ready to get next is probably a suburban unless they drastically change the vehicle a lot . 
uh , i'm just getting tired of when i do get hung up in traffic , not being able to determine what the problem is and come to some resolution of whether it's better to sit in the traffic light and wait or get off at the next exit and that kind of stuff .
my  cimarron  is just so small and so low to the ground that i can't see past any vehicle  ,
well , i'm considering probably some kind of a pickup truck myself for the next vehicle . 
uh , i just have so many hauling projects a lot of times 
and , uh , i'd like to just start doing some , uh , carpentry , uh , type work around . 
i just feel that , 
so , so what have you seen lately that , um , you think is worthwhile ? 
um , the last movie i saw was regarding henry . 
have you seen that yet ? 
it's really good . 
i loved it . 
um , it's , um . 
does it have a happy ending , 
 um , uh , it's one of the best movies i've seen in a long time . 
i generally don't get into movies that much , 
but i saw that one , 
and then before that one , i saw , um , oh , naked gun two and a half . 
have you seen that one ? 
 and the regular naked gun and airport and , you know . 
but it was silly . 
so , now these are for two very different movies . 
one , uh , absolutely slapstick comedy and one clearly , you know , serious subject . 
yeah , 
i guess i have similarly broad tastes . 
um , my most recent , um , movie that i liked a lot , not my most recent movie , was henry the fifth . 
i only rented it , you know , maybe a month ago 
 and it's been out for a couple of years , 
but . have you seen that ? 
well , of the shakespeare play , 
and it's beautifully done . 
um , i believe that all the language is as shakespeare wrote it , except it's been shortened a little bit 
and there might be a word or two changed . 
uh , but it's a glorious movie 
 um , and i like , as you know , silly movies , 
and i also like just some strange movies . 
do you have any . 
well , um , is the the cook , the thief , his wife , her lover . 
um , but there are also these various , um , david lynch movies . 
um , i got hooked on twin peaks . 
that made me go out and watch every david lynch movie i could lay my hands on . 
oh , really . 
i haven't seen any of those . 
they're really good ? 
i mean , you have to just sort of like this thing , 
you have to like , 
did you see twin peaks ? 
so , okay . 
so , maybe you wouldn't be drawn to these movies , either . 
they're just strange . 
well , uh . 
uh , but , a little bit strange and esoteric 
and , uh , in the case of twin peak there's some elements of the supernatural in it , too . 
oh really . 
that was the television show . 
um , there's also puts on even weirder movies . 
uh , his most recent ones have actually been fairly mainstream , like hair spray . 
um , but back in his early days , he had things , um , um , 
what are the titles , 
i can't remember the titles any more . but , some really weird ones , uh , with quite a random crew of characters . 
um , it would have made , you know , these fellini movies look normal . 
so do you like , um , movies a lot ? 
see i don't do , 
i don't . 
see , i don't do that , 
i don't go to movies that often , 
but , just recently i've been to a couple .
do you rent them , 
 um , no , 
but , i don't know , 
i usually fall asleep 
or i get bored pretty easily 
that's what my wife does too , um , 
i mean , she falls asleep .
so we have to pick just the right kind of movie 
that's exactly right . 
well , well it was good talking to you . 
it's good to talk to you , too . 
take care . 
did they tell you our topic ? 
uh , no , 
it's , uh , 
uh , what is the topic ? 
the topic is cars . 
what kind of car will you buy next 
and what kind of decision uh , and why . 
uh , my next car to buy probably would be a cadillac . 
i've had , uh , 
well , i'm on my third one . 
and i'm not real sure that i'd be in the market for a car for quite a while . 
i'm the same way . 
 uh , i had two cadillacs . 
i went to my first lincoln this last time . 
i travel 
and , uh , my grandfather worked for ford motor company 
 so i finally tried one 
and , uh , i've had , and one suburban in my last five cars , 
but i bought a lincoln 
and i like it . 
my dad has been a , uh , lincoln man for a lot of years , 
but i've always been a g m man . 
i'm in the auto parts business myself . 
oh , are you ? 
and , uh , the last cadillac i bought was an allante . 
and i just love it to death . 
i'm not sure i'd ever get rid of it . 
well , i'm a traveling salesman . 
i travel on the road 
so i like a little heavier car 
i used to do that quite a bit myself . 
so that's why i choose , you know , to drive a heavier car 
i will probably get a cadillac the next time quite honestly . 
but , there's just something about that cadillac that , whether it's a g m c product or whatever .
they seem to put , 
i think so , too . 
and , you know , the buttons on the controls and things like that are a little easier to get to than ford products 
and i think that's one of the things that makes me shy away from , uh , imports is they put so much , you know , gadgetry on the dash 
the buttons are so small 
they really do . 
and g m doesn't seem to do that . 
i kind of like that feature , 
you know , i'm a funny duck 
it comes to the simple things like front end alignments 
i have never had to have a front end alignment on a cadillac . 
i don't know why 
but , i've never had to have a front end alignment on a cadillac . 
they always appear to hold well . 
 uh , i had an eldorado , was my first one , was an eighty 
 and , uh , i think at about sixty thousand miles i finally had it lined up . 
did you . 
and i had them do all four wheels . 
and the only thing i miss about a cadillac is , 
a fleetwood brougham was my last car 
and i traded it in on my lincoln 
and they're just not as large as before . 
i do miss that . 
that's true , 
but , what is big today . 
well , you're right . 
you know . lincoln is still as big as it always has been 
it's big , 
but the trunk space for me , uh , 
what i usually do is i usually take the back seat out of my car 
and that's where i put my samples because trunks just aren't big enough . 
you know a car i ran across recently that has a tremendously large trunk is the lincoln continental . 
now , i have the town car 
and uh , the cadillac . 
well , the town car , i noticed , uh , 
or one time 
oh , good . 
you know , straight across . 
i mean , 
they went all the way down ? 
well , that's good . 
not going from side to side . 
that's good . 
and we got three full sets in there and still had room for luggage . 
i sell sporting goods , uh , hunting related items , 
i sell gun cases 
i see . 
 and i need to , you know , 
that's about the same size as a golf club . 
samples need to stretch out and gun cases and things like that 
i don't know if you've ever looked at a continental . 
uh , it's not as peppy as a town car 
 because it's a v six , 
but it , uh , 
i drove it from here to memphis 
and i really enjoyed driving that car . 
if i was going to buy a ford product , that's what i would buy . 
i drove mine a couple weeks ago to one of our big national sales meetings in nashville . 
i usually fly . 
i drove it with another one of my guy that worked for me . 
we drove it ten hours to nashville , 
and it handled real well , 
but , my main thing is space , 
so if a continental , 
i might consider it the next time , 
a continental has 
you might take a look at them . 
a lot more trunk space . 
as a matter of fact , they had more trunk space than my , uh , sedan de ville had . 
you always have leather interiors on your cadillacs ? 
i like leather interiors also . 
uh , i had a eighty eldorado , which was leather 
and , uh , then my eightysix was a touring sedan . 
and , uh , it had the gray leather package in it 
and my allante has , uh 
that's a nice car . 
you bet , 
and i will say one thing about cadillacs versus , 
uh , so my favorite team is about the rangers . 
is it ? 
i'd have to agree with that . 
they are my favorite team , too . 
a little disappointing the last few years . 
i'm telling you . 
you think they'll sign ruben ? 
you know 
 you know , with that guy from pittsburgh getting all that money , twentyseven or twentynine million or whatever it was , i just don't think that they're going to be able to sign ruben sierra 
and it's just going to be a shame for , you know , our area . 
i think it's going to have a big effect if they don't on the other , uh , hispanic players . 
oh , i do , too . 
i just , 
i think 
the main thing , 
it's just going to effect on the team , you know . 
we just can't seem to , you know , 
i think we've been in this spot , 
i think we finished second once or maybe even twice . 
i don't know , 
it's just too disappointing . 
i just watch them fall every year . 
i was a pete incaviglia fan 
and , uh 
but , of course , i understand baseball decisions are all just , 
decisions like that have to be made by someone .
glad it's not me making them . 
i think they just want to stay mediocre and draw their two million fans out there and then be happy with it and not have to pay the bucks to get a contender in here . 
they say as long as they draw up two million fans that 
 and that's the name of the game , too . 
you got to make money .
now , it's just 
you and i should be so lucky you know , to go out and swing a bat and get two thousand dollars every time you swing the bat or something like that . 
that's true . 
but , uh , they were talking about trading him , if they're not able to sign him and , uh , use the money that it would take to sign the guy , you know , to pay for pitchers or , you know , what else they need . 
because they've got the hitting , 
but they need the pitching . 
they really do . 
 uh , i think they need them all . 
i understand the big cities , like in new york or l a or somewhere because big cities 
and , you know , a pro athlete can go out there in the afternoon and probably make five thousand dollars just by doing a personal appearance at a 
oh , i know . 
but , i realize the difference , 
but , i just don't understand , 
it's sure aggravating when you go out and bust your butt working , you know , your day job and you can work your day job the rest of your life and not bring home as much money as they bring home in one game . 
oh , i know . 
it's real aggravating , 
but , one thing i don't understand is why a group , you know , headed up by george bush would buy the texas rangers and not really get behind them 
because i tell you , we need a winner in this town . 
it looks like our cowboys are coming back 
that's right . 
but , you know , in the past half a dozen years , all we've had is the , uh 
it's always got , 
it's always wondered me why , i mean , they act as though this area is not , you know , a big metropolitan area , 
but you think we'd , someday get an owner in here that could afford to buy the players we need . 
oh , i know . 
just real aggravating to 
because i've lived here , you know , since , well , i was born and raised here , 
so i've been a ranger fan since about seventyseven , 
so it's a lot of losers .
oh , i know . 
it's about to get , you know 
i've been one , 
i've lived here since seventyfour 
and i've really been a ranger fan for the longest time 
and excuse me , i don't miss a time picking up the morning paper 
i mean i follow them 
and i follow them like i follow the mavericks and like i follow the cowboys , 
the fans deserve it . 
i mean , it ,
i love nolan ryan . 
i guess you probably love him , too . 
i think this town would go crazy if they ever got even a playoff team . 
oh , i 
 i mean , 
and they got that new stadium they are building . 
so , at least that will be exciting 
it will . 
well , where do you think they are heading this year ? 
uh , it's hard to say . 
it's going to be depending on what they do with ruben sierra 
and , uh , i mean , i'm getting tired of them going into each year saying , you know , bobby witt is the answer and kevin brown 
and , man , that's getting old , you know . 
these guys have been pampered . 
i mean , it's time to either , you know , put out or shut up . 
bobby witt 
and they have the later ten game winning streak 
 and they give him all kinds of money 
and then he just goes right down the tubes . 
and valentine and greave , you know , they're about to get old . 
but i like this sandy johnson . 
what's going on ? 
well , just go ahead and talk , 
that's all . 
are you sure ? 
we're supposed to talk about lawn and garden . 
i'm supposed to find out what you do for your lawn 
what do i do ? 
well , uh , i cut it 
you're ahead of me . 
 uh , is that good ? 
and i edge it occasionally . 
oh , that's really good . 
see , am i good , or what ? 
and , uh , 
i don't do any of that . 
well , i call my lawn man , eric , whatever his name is , i can't remember . 
oh , he is going to build you a fence . 
well , he's giving me an estimate . 
and for ten dollars a week , i don't see any reason 
what , for 
oh , well , i thought , isn't he the same one ? 
he is . 
yeah , 
but ten dollars , or what does he charge , not even that . 
what does he charge me ? 
 well , my , 
i don't know . 
it's like next to nothing . 
 it's ten because i , 
it's forty a month . 
but if there's five weeks , i still pay forty . 
but you know , you ought to get him to pull the weeds . 
well , he won't pull weeds . 
he says he'll spray them , 
but he won't pull them . 
uh , he won't cut them is what he won't do .
and he's right . 
that's true . 
but he just says to keep spraying them so , 
well so , 
anyway , gene sprayed them once or twice for me 
so 
there are two out front 
i thought i'd grab one of these days , 
but i haven't bothered as i walk on by . 
i started to pull the weeds in the rocks out front 
 and all of a sudden i came cross this big clump of weeds 
and there was dog dirt in it 
oh , oh , goody . 
 and i threw the gloves in the trash bag that was out there 
and i left the whole thing 
i thought you were going to say there 
i would rather a snake , 
oh , god , oh .
i just left the whole thing . 
the bag is still out there because i haven't touched it . 
i haven't gone back over there . 
it really made me mad . 
oh , god . 
so anyway but , 
but , uh , how are your flowers , your little things you planted ? 
did they die or what ? 
oh , yeah , 
oh , they're all , 
so they , oh , 
are they going to come back in the spring ? 
i don't know . 
and then i got some nice , uh , mums at thanksgiving that i put in the pots out there 
 and i thought they were supposed to live through all the cold weather . 
they looked real pretty until about a week before christmas , 
then they started to die , too . 
so , i don't think any of it comes back 
maybe these , 
sometimes things do that aren't even supposed to . 
i don't know , uh , 
those flowers , remember those little ones you gave me ? 
yeah , 
well , a few weeks ago . 
well , that's good . 
they're the best kind . 
they're like indestructible . 
they really grow nice 
and sometimes , they're not supposed to come back , 
but lots of times they do . 
we'll see . 
but that's because we didn't hit one for a long time . 
i hope not .
neither one of us 
boy , i hate to think 
i know it . 
i can't believe this . 
i got somebody from 
where was the person last night 
you're kidding ? 
and we get each other down the street . 
this is so funny . 
 well , the , uh , 
i talked to someone woman from oklahoma city and some woman from dallas 
and that was it . 
i've had dallas , arlington . 
i've had , uh , one plano 
i can't remember , 
but she told me about the utah jazz , 
we talked about basketball . 
oh , really  ? 
and i don't remember what the place was last night , 
but i'm not sure 
i'd know the place , anyway . 
i don't know , 
but mostly they're from the area . 
well , there isn't really much to talk about as far as lawn and garden goes . 
not for me . 
you know , not 
but i don't , you know , 
 and edge it 
and that's about it . 
i know . 
what do i do with it ? 
i know , 
we're not typical texans . 
bu ,  , 
what's going on , 
are they going to tell us to stop or what  ? 
i don't know , 
i hope so . 
 come on , 
isn't it five minutes ? 
i don't know . 
 i mean , i'm all talked out about gardens . 
i know . 
it's just a suggested topic . 
oh , oh , it's just suggested ? 
so , how's the baby , do you think  ? 
how's the , 
let's talk about the baby . 
do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan ? 
we're at the point now , 
i quit working about six months ago to start this house 
 and i'm out of cash 
and i'm not out of project yet . 
oh , no . 
so , uh , i'm going to go back and do some consulting work . 
as far as budget's concerned , i'm fairly fortunate . 
uh , we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra , we can make it on what my wife makes . 
so , you know , the project's kind of halted until then . 
but as far as budgeting is concerned , you know , we have , uh , some pretty strict guidelines that we go for , you know , 
we always put ten percent back , 
and that's a never touch . 
uh , into savings . 
either savings or investment , one of the two , 
but we don't ever put it in a high risk . 
it's just always going to be there . 
well , that's pretty good . 
and as far as the rest of it's concerned , we don't have any kind of , uh , what i would call extravagant expenses , you know , 
uh , we pretty much live on about eight , nine hundred a month , you know , just travel to and from work and clothing and food 
boy , that's pretty good . 
 and the rest of it , you know , we pile into the house . 
and , uh , you know , i'm fairly fortunate . 
i mean , our credit cards are out to the max right now because i'm 
but , uh , we're still making the payments on them . 
it's just , when you , 
see in texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home 
 it's tough here too . 
you have to have the contractor sign with you . 
but it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it 
    , where i live , that is . 
and where i live , it's pretty scary , because texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that 
the bank can eat the contractor . 
oh , bad for him , huh . 
but , the homeowner can't be touched . 
it's a homestead state . 
is that right ? 
the only thing they could do is cut off electricity . 
they can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes . period . 
you know . they can take your car and your clothes and your , anything 
that's not the tools of your trade , 
but as far as , uh , you know  , you're pretty much bullet proof in this state . 
well , that's kind of handy . 
i just finished james michener's texas book . 
pretty interesting . 
texas has quite the history . 
well , you know , we're not ones to budget much , you know .
we just going to spend it all . 
that's kind of what we do . 
 uh , we're l d s 
and so we pay ten percent 
 and then , you know , we put i guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account . 
but that sometimes we use for emergency type things . 
 uh , and my wife doesn't work . 
we're fortunate that way , that i make enough to do what we want to do . 
we're pretty , pretty fortunate as far as uh , the budgeting is concerned , because , you know , we don't have any long term debt . 
you know , uh , we paid cash for car . 
well , we bought the car on time , one of them , 
but you know , we since paid it off . 
well that's pretty . 
the land is paid for cash , 
so we don't have to worry about that . 
that's a great position to be in . 
well , it's fraught with other problems .
is that right ? 
what kind of consulting do you do ? 
uh , systems consulting . computerization for construction firms . 
is that right ? 
i'm into computers , too . 
you into mainframes ? 
 oh really ? 
i'm just brushing up on , well , c plus plus . 
are you really ? 
i just got that a few days ago . 
three oh ? 
don't get me to lying . 
i bought it at a fire sale . 
this guy's place burned down , 
and he had a bunch of computer stuff , 
and , you know , i bought it all . 
it was two hundred bucks for everything he had . 
you got a buy . 
well , some of it wasn't worth anything , you know . 
you know , a lot of the , uh , diskettes were just totally unusable . 
melted , or just wet 
 well , yeah 
 , or wet .
but i did get out of there with , uh , vermont views , which is a huge , 
cindy , you there ? 
what kind of dinner parties have you had ? 
well , i've had them , uh , where i've served up to twelve to sixteen people . 
uh , and i had help with them . 
uh , and part of them i did were like a buffet 
 and , uh , it , 
i had , uh , just different , uh , side dishes and appetizers 
and one of them that i'd remembered was , uh , some , uh , sausage hors d'oeuvres 
and , uh , anyhow , uh , you take , uh , a couple of , uh , cups of bisquick 
i guess you could use the hot if you wanted to . 
whatever you like , huh ? 
and , uh , you put that in 
and then you get some real sharp cheddar cheese 
and then , like , i just put them in little balls and bake them for about fifteen minutes 
 and they are so good . 
oh , that sounds delicious . 
yeah . 
it's making me hungry for them 
you know , i've made like little swedish meatballs , 
have you ? 
i've used that quite a bit 
 and it seems to work real well . 
and , uh , uh , when i've had so many people , uh , to feed , like i try to do a ham and a turkey 
you know , after we moved in here , uh , which i had things like that , 
but i always cooked them ahead of time 
and then i just sliced them .
have you ever had that ? 
put some little fresh shrimp 
and it's , in your macaroni salad that you make . 
the shrimp just gives it a really good flavor . 
oh , i'll bet . 
i don't like the can , but the fresh . 
you know . 
i'll have to try that . 
that was really good . 
i like things that are easy and , uh , nutritious . 
but , uh , at , uh , christmas time we just have a regular sit down dinner , you know . 
and then by time you pass everything around , 
it seems like everything on your plate's cold . 
i know . 
i know .
but anyhow , i , 
thank god for microwaves , you know . 
you can ,
but , uh , other than that , i don't have too many parties . 
uh , you know , i have , like , maybe just another couple over 
but , uh , other than that i don't have , you know 
and i have my family . 
well i don't anymore . 
it's been a few years 
 and , uh , i don't have , you know , over a couple either 
spend all my time in the kitchen . 
and , uh , 
that's easy . 
i always like to have that , too . 
yeah . 
everybody seems to like that , too . 
i know , 
i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't . 
everybody likes that . 
and , then , uh , if you have a nice big roast that you can throw in the oven , then you can put your potatoes and carrots or whatever else 
oh , yeah . 
that's what i love , with my d , 
i like it , too . 
i do , too . 
and , uh , other than that , in fact , i'm just thinking of what next weekend when the super bowl's on 
i've asked a couple people to come over 
and i just , uh , had been thinking what to have for that .
well , have you had any good ideas 
oh , okay . 
and you know , i don't want to have to come away from the t v . 
i want something that i can just take them and serve them while they're sitting in front of the t v . 
you know , so , i'll think of something , just that we can munch on over there , you know . 
and they can just fill their plate up at intermission and then go back over there and sit down . 
and that's the way to do it , too . 
 in this day and time that we can have good food that's good for you 
and you don't have to spend hours and hours and hours in the kitchen . 
preparing it , 
well , when i was brought up , you know , we didn't , 
uh , go ahead , 
tell me what you think . 
do we get our money's worth ? 
hey , listen , if i had my way , i wouldn't pay my taxes . 
not with some of the things that i hear that our tax money is going for some ludicrous things . 
did you see sixty minutes last night ? 
well , they did a thing on the thirtyfive billion dollars we waste every year just on storing stuff for the military we don't need . 
and , uh , it's staggering . 
well , how did this grab you ? 
uh , this , 
 i'm a lady , 
but i heard this on a christian program 
and it was , uh , about the n e a 
and , that's the national endowment for arts , 
and this act on a stage and did a study on it between two lesbians and two homosexuals and wrote a report about that with our money . 
well , there are a lot of things that people , i think general , 
and then it just frosts me terribly . 
well , i think it's interesting to look at , uh , where the money goes , 
and it goes a lot of places where it probably ought not go 
and how it serves us given the extraordinarily large sum of money the government has to operate with . 
i believe that's true , 
and what i think is going to be really interesting is what we do about it . 
i mean , we are going to have to change the people who represent us . 
that's correct . 
i mean , and i think it's going to be real interesting to see and then force upon them , uh , 
heavy involvement from the public . 
right that's 
heavy involvement from the public . 
our anger is going to have to give 
uh , i've said for years that there's full employment for the politically active 
and in our society , uh , there's very little full employment . 
most people in this country are getting worse off , not better off . 
eighty percent of the public , according to bill moyers' , uh , 
public broadcasting , which , by the way is a very good use of government money . i think p b s is wonderful . 
but this special focused on the fact that eighty percent of the people in this country are seeing their real incomes , 
and thus , standards of living , decline . 
and twenty percent are seeing theirs improve . 
that's not a formula for a better society . 
it is not . 
it's lopsided , very much 
and the government really plays a role in this . 
that's right , 
they pull the strings . 
i mean , w , well , they are the people whose strings are pulled and by i guess powerful intere , 
you know , and it's really interesting to see how that affects people because essentially more and more people in this country are not likely to revolt in the way that people used to think of the voter revolting . 
but people are pretty much getting the picture that some people get taken care of and others don't 
and they think it's unfair , 
and when they recognize that it's their tax money , they're going to do more about it . 
 uh , one thing very interesting . 
c b s , after the state of the union address is going to open up a telephone line , an eight hundred number 
and people can call in and say what they think about what's going on in this country . 
they expect , opening it for one hour ,
i'm sure they will . 
and i've thought for years it would make a lot of sense to and vent their frustration with government .
i think that's coming 
and i think once people really start to communicate how they feel , things are going to change . 
until then , i think , you know , it's going to be really painful . 
so the question is , how soon are we going to start to get our money's worth 
and , as you said , it's how soon we get involved , 
i understand that , 
but hopefully that the people that are listening to what our comments are take some action on it . 
well , that's the good thing about what is happening because i think more and more the news media , which takes a heck of a beating and deserves some of it , is telling us , you know , about the problems . 
so the more we communicate , hey , look , we want a change here , because , you know , as it turns out , we've wasted a tremendous amount of money on our defense spending in this country . 
oh , absolutely . 
over a very long period of time . 
uh , and , uh , 
we only see the tip of the iceberg only . 
you know , there's so much 
well , you may be right . 
what i think is really going to be interesting is to see how , uh , we as a society deal with it 
it's a , 
well what do you think about the everyday occurrences that are an invasion of your privacy ? 
well , the , uh , 
what the constant calls , people selling things 
you know , that's what i really . 
i think that's the only thing i wrote down also , 
because it's terrible today , 
i mean , my wife and i , seems like we get home at five thirty and the damn phone starts ringing 
never stops ringing , 
that's right . 
well , you know , is an answering machine .
i know , 
that's true . 
i mean , one of the best inventions ever , you know , 
you just switch that thing on , 
and , uh , .
that's true . 
but , you know , people , 
it's like your name must be on a list or something , because i know at my office , i probably average at least a call a day , 
and a lot of days i'll get two and three calls , from 
um , even in an office ? 
 and , uh , you know , your name out to people also , 
as far as brokers all , i get calls from brokers in new york , 
and , uh 
and now i'm getting the same calls at the house . 
i know . 
 and they get your name from dunn and bradstreet , 
and , uh , credit card companies , they sell your name . 
oh , yeah , 
uh , well , you know , these people , they sell your names , 
 i mean 
 i know . 
 you know , i , 
that's also an invasion of privacy . 
i think it 
american express does that , by the way . 
oh , they do ? 
well , sure it is . 
and that is an invasion of privacy , 
you're right . 
that's right . 
well , you know , if you've ever gotten anything , you know , in your life , your name is somewhere .
i know , 
that's true . 
i mean , one magazine , and boom , they got your name forever . 
magazine companies , uh , uh , from subscriptions do the same thing 
it's the way they make additional money . 
that's right . 
but , uh , you know , i guess , it , uh , 
you have to be a certain income holder to , uh , have an american express card , 
so your name is valuable to , i guess , x amount of solicitors calling . 
that's right . 
so , i don't know . 
where are you from ? 
oh , i'm from texas . 
oh , okay , 
well so , 
we live in the dallas area , richardson . 
 oh , we're in plano . 
 well , you know , the only call i really got that , well , was out of state , 
i got one from oklahoma city , and one from california . 
did you ? 
and that was , uh , california , 
i was thrilled to death , because that's , you know , the furthest i'd gotten any call from , you know , 
and , um , 
i've talked to people in utah , people in new york 
oh , really . 
 and a lot of times i'll call eight or nine o'clock in the morning 
and i'll get people 
see , well uh , that was the one from california . 
i don't know why i ask people on the weekends  ,
or , uh , i don't know , you know , 
where you from ? 
not from texas . 
 uh , originally from new jersey . 
new jersey , 
yeah . 
my wife's from new jersey . 
oh , really , 
what part ? 
from , uh , saddle river . 
oh , that's nice over there . 
we're uh , from sort of towards the shore , central 
we're like , uh , 
well , that's nice , too . 
it was beautiful , 
that's why i really miss it . 
i don't really like it here at all .
my wife's been away for twentyfive years , 
so she's been away for quite a while . 
her dad was from little rock , arkansas , 
and her mother was from new york , 
so they just 
so they , 
uh , and anyway , this topic is a good topic , as far as invasion of your privacy , 
but that's just all the solicitors calling . 
 well , yeah , 
i mean , 
and , then , of course they call , you know , 
before i got the answering machine , it was ridiculous 
i know . 
the minute i get home the phone would be ringing . 
that's a good suggestion . 
i might start using the answering machine more , because 
oh , it's great , 
i mean . 
well , you know , in fact , i've been missing calls from the t i switchboard , 
because i always have it on 
 and i assumed you know , it was from the switchboard . 
you know .
you're probably right . 
it is , because one day i listened , you know , and it was  ,
but , um , i just got totally disgusted , 
and then , you know , people asking for money for everything , you know , 
i mean . 
i understand . 
i mean , i , 
it's hard to believe there's that many deputy sheriffs associations 
and , you know , the policeman's associations . 
i know , 
they call you one time to send three kids to the car , 
oh , i used to do that . 
i used to do that , 
i'd send , three kids to the movies or something .
there's always a dif , 
so , it's nice to talk with you 
and , um , food is a very intriguing thing . 
our lives nutritionally good for us . 
yes , sir . 
what kind of dining out do you like ? 
 well , there is two kinds . 
one i guess i'd say is with my wife where uh 
uh , you know , something nice . 
and the other is with my whole family whom we , uh , go somewhere that the kids will enjoy .
uh , recently we have been hitting pancho's up . 
it's a local mexican restaurant . 
  because they have got you know , good prices and everything . 
pancho's , that's ,
it's a chain down he , uh , 
it goes up into colorado and down here . 
i don't know where else it is . 
what about you ? 
we have one called chi chi's in our area . 
oh , yeah . 
and , uh , we had a restaurant called la bamba 
but it closed recently . 
but chi chi's is a national restaurant , i think . 
isn't it mexican ? 
i think , 
do you have it there ? 
 i think i've seen it around . 
yes , sir . 
 well , i love mexican food myself . 
oh , do you ? 
but you go ahead now .
oh , we do too . 
 uh , we enjoy mexican food . 
i'm just not impressed with the quality of it . 
it's just primarily the price that's , uh , satisfying at this point . 
but the kids , 
is that right ? 
uh , and , uh , let's see . 
we've , uh , just recently discovered a super restaurant down here 
but it's , uh , not part of a chain 
it's just an individually owned seafood restaurant . 
but the first one we've been to that , uh , i don't think there was anything on the menu , that any of us had 
that was , uh , not just really super . 
it's nice to find a place like that . 
oh , boy that is wonderful . 
well , i agree with you on that . 
and i was really a seafood addict myself . 
i love crab meat in particular . 
on seafood and almost live on the crab meat if i had to . 
have you ever been to , uh , what is it , original book binders in philadelphia ? 
i , uh , know the name 
uh , that's an old established , uh , restaurant . 
i used to go there when i was in college . 
where did you go to college ? 
uh , i went to the naval academy . 
 and we used to , 
we would go over there to , uh , 
original book binders 
i think it was , 
i haven't been back there in years . 
well , we're supposed to be talking about dinning out , 
but i'll just make one comment that , uh , i just retired from penn state , 
and , uh , all my work has been in research for the navy .
what area ? 
underwater acoustics . 
is that right ? 
did you have any dealings with the , uh , underwater sound reference laboratory in orlando , florida ? 
i have dealt with nearly all of the research laboratories that the country has . 
yes , sir . 
my dad worked there for years , and years . 
 uh , that's where i grew up was down in orlando . 
 oh , you grew up in orlando . 
 uh , that's interesting , well , i was in submarines . uh , 
well , that's what i worked on . 
must have had some interesting , uh , assignments for you there . 
when did you retire ? 
the end of last month . 
 well , great . 
i'm sure you've seen some interesting developments in acoustics . 
so , i hate to , uh , 
i wish i could talk to you about that , uh , 
but , uh , i guess we should continue on , uh , 
okay . 
how do you like chinese food ? 
oh , we do enjoy that . 
yes , sir . 
uh , i don't know if we are particularly adventurous , 
we find something we like , uh , like cashew shrimp or something that's got a good , uh , at a particular restaurant 
and then we usually stick by it . 
 but do you , 
well , i , uh , enjoy the szechuan type of , uh , chinese food . 
yep , uh , 
it's , uh , 
i do a lot of chinese cooking myself . 
i have in the past . 
i haven't done recently , 
but , uh , it's in the sweet and sour porks and things like are just really delicious meals . 
um . where did you learn how to do chinese cooking ? 
 uh , just at home . 
i enjoyed the food 
and i bought a lot of , uh , good cookbooks , 
and i've been following through on that . 
when you find the right cookbook , why it works out . 
what's a good reference cookbook for chinese food ? 
well , that one's a good question . 
here it's right under my nose if i can find it .
i guess one of the things we've , uh , started avoiding is the , uh , run of the mill chop suey and things like that . 
 but we enjoy trying , uh , different kinds of chicken or , uh , you know , even , uh , shrimp , uh , dishes that are fixed in a chinese restaurant . 
one of this book i have is called chinese cooking made easy . 
uh , it's a paperback 
and i think it's by someone named chang . 
isabelle chang . 
thanks for that , uh , reference . 
i think you will enjoy that . 
well , it certainly is nice talking with you gene . 
and , uh , what is your phone at home ? 
what do you think are possible changes in the , uh , way trials are conducted these days ? 
do you like the way some people in there for instance , really take over and , uh , we have no way , uh , of knowing whether they are legitimately right or wrong and so forth . 
what do you think about these things ? 
well , as i look at our trial systems , 
i think they've gotten to be quite a joke . the way the people can appeal and file for mistrials 
and they've taken a lot of the things that were set up to make it be a fair system and used it to their advantage . 
i think that a jury should listen to the courts , uh , to the hearings and to everything , 
but i think they should only weigh fifty percent of the decision . 
i think the judge should hold or maybe even fortynine , 
and the judge should be able to rule one way or the other . 
you think the judge should actually have the final say ? 
i think he should . 
and i think that there should be more than one judge . 
there should be maybe two , at least 
do you know what i mean ? 
um , and i think that it's important to have a jury , but i think the way that they go through so much time to get it a fair one . 
that's okay too . 
as long as it's not used to delay the trial so much . 
they need to have a fair jury 
but they only fortynine percent of the decision or fifty percent 
and then the two judges would go ahead and make the final decision . 
how do you feel about that ? 
i have been in a fairly important trial , 
and , uh , what bothers me is i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand 
that's the part that bothered me about it . 
um , i really think that the jury ought to have more say so in the selection or in the determination of whether they are guilty or not . 
but i also think that the jury should be , uh , accurate decisions . 
i hate to see people brought in who basically have lived out in the country and don't know much about any of this stuff , 
and they just make a decision based on whether they like the dress she wore that day or whether that guy smiled or growled all the time . 
that's no way to make a decision on some terrible problem . 
well , what if they used , you know , 
i just had a thought come as you were talking . 
what if they used law students and had that be credit hours to sit in trials ? 
that would be certainly nice 
let's say 
we would have fifty percent of them law students ,
at least , 
 and that would give them ,
and it could count as some aspect or hours going into their major . 
that's a very neat idea , 
and they would learn a lot about being lawyers later in life 
that's right . 
that would be a really good thing to do . 
so it's  , 
i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial , 
 and what happened was her husband was , uh , involved in a motorcycle accident where a drunk driver ran the stoplight 
and he ran into the motorcycle . 
but her husband , was killed was because his brakes went out on his motorcycle . 
he was just taking it home from the place . 
it was brand new , 
and his brakes did not work . 
for goodness sakes . 
and this expensive , big company that owned these motorcycles , um , railroaded this into three years worth of trials for this lady 
and she had a son that was just only two years old when it happened 
 and they were following him home in the car . saw the whole thing happen . 
oh , they saw the husband ,
they were following him home from the motorcycle shop . 
and they railroaded this whole trial into mistrials , um , this and that and the other . 
every time she'd get a verdict that would be in her favor of her ,
they would find something wrong with it . 
until finally they won and ,
did they really ? 
but i just felt like justice wasn't served because they had the money , the big lawyers , and she didn't , 
that is a shame . 
you'd think there would be enough , uh , people who saw the accident other than his wife ,
and they have nothing to gain one way or the other . 
so if they say a certain way , then why not believe them . 
and i don't know all the details on that , 
but i certainly think that we've come up with a good idea with the students coming into the jury . 
and i don't think that it would be such a bad idea even if the judge didn't have the final say . 
do you have any ? 
we have a dog that we got from the , uh , 
well , we call it the s p c a . 
it's from an animal shelter . 
uh , he'd come in there as a stray . 
all right . 
uh , he's a pomeranian and sheltie cross . 
uh , well , he was very well trained when we got him . 
uh , he's , 
oh , that's good . 
you don't often find that , 
i don't think . 
no , uh , 
we suspect that he you know , got away from somebody traveling through , and hurt in an accident 
and , uh , if they were local people , they would have been able to find him . 
there's a , 
okay , uh , 
that's interesting . 
the only pet that i've had , uh , 
i'm a doctoral student right now 
 and a good friend of mine 
and , uh , it was an amazing dog , 
it really was . 
he had gotten it from the pound 
and , uh , it's a spanish pointer named domino .
oh , yeah . 
 and we trained it from a pup , 
and basically it's fully trained 
and it can do a lot of things . 
it will get beer for you out of the fridge , 
and it will get the newspaper and do all kinds of stuff . 
so , it's kind of a show piece 
 and whenever anybody comes over , we all have to show him domino  you know  .
oh , i think so . 
it's , uh , 
she's been a real good dog 
and , uh , just , it's kind of a shame that i'm away from it now . 
i actually live in florida 
 but i'm on an internship up here for a year 
and then i go back down , 
but , uh , 
domino's a real good dog . 
uh , what , uh , possessed you to get the dog ? 
well , i guess , in one sense we felt that , it's nice to have a dog even though there are , you know , complications come with it . 
and then with our children , uh , 
at the time they were , oh , grade five and grade eight , 
sure learn a little bit of discipline and how to care for it and things like that . 
that's good . 
that kind of builds some 
 so   , 
well , that's the idea . 
i think the reality of it is , that they perhaps , 
uh , it depends on the , 
and , uh , from that aspect , i'm short on the discipline , because i don't , uh , enforce that the kids look after the dog 
and , uh , we've had him about four years now . 
uh , but i think it , you know , 
it's necessary that individuals have the discipline to look after the animal properly , uh , 
that's something that's important for sure . 
i think , uh , do you live in a fairly rural part of the , uh 
oh , i see . 
uh , uh , in the middle of a residential area . 
 uh , so that is not as good , uh , you know , 
this dog , being a small dog it's , uh , more more acceptable 
 but again , 
it's not that big of a problem . 
with domino , she was full grown , 
i would estimate seventy pounds . 
and , you know , we lived in oviedo , which is a small town , 
it's a suburb of orlando 
 but  , there wasn't a lot of room for her to run around , 
and she was a dog that loved to run , 
so that was the biggest problem i saw , 
or , you know , i guess you can't really say for cats . 
me and cats don't get along too well , uh  , 
but , you know , that whole space issue , i think , is real important . 
 uh , that's one of the biggest concerns . 
it's like , uh , 
there's a lot to be gained from a relationship with an animal , 
but the same time , one has to recognize the reality of physical requirements of 
 and the larger they are , the more room they need to exercise . 
and that's all part of keeping your part of the relationship .
 well   , 
you know , and also , the whole thing with noise . 
my mother , oh , she freaks out because she's got neighbors that have dogs , that don't train them 
 and , you know , we had a neighbor in nebraska when we lived there that had , uh , brittany spaniels 
and they're very high strung animals to begin with , 
but , uh , 
how do you get your news mostly ? 
generally , i get most of my news from , uh , the radio . 
and then sometimes , uh , if i've got time , i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper 
uh , also , since my wife likes to watch t v , sometimes , uh , uh , you know , i have to watch the news late at night 
how about you ? 
well , i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come . 
so that's the first thing i want is the headlines . 
it's really funny because , uh , uh , my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines .
uh , and then when five o'clock comes around i just want to get in the house and turn the t v on to watch the news . 
it's really weird . 
uh , i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long . 
but , uh , i love to watch the five o'clock news 
and makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where i can read my paper .
uh , i do have my radio going most of the day though , 
so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too , you know . 
do you 
but as far as the actual news , i get that from the , 
can you hold on just for a second ? 
just a minute . 
i'm sorry to keep you waiting .
uh , i was calling from work 
 and that was a call waiting . 
it sounds like you , uh , like the news a lot more than i do . 
i figure if it's something really important , somebody will tell me about it . 
but , uh , you know , if i catch the news all the time , it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news . 
 or that's what 
that's true too . 
and , uh , you know , also late at night , you know , i don't like watching the news late at night 
but my wife is usually up then 
and so 
i , uh , 
but , you know , i wish i had , uh , more news on things like , that i consider long range . things like science and medicine 
 uh , i guess i'm more into science and science fiction 
and , uh , there's , you know , 
not that the news is science fiction , 
but , uh , uh , i'm more interested in that . 
things like , uh , is nasa ready for another space shot . uh , you know , how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer 
 and , uh , uh , you know , a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me . 
well , you're right . 
there is a lot of it that's just garbage , as far as i'm concerned , you know . 
but i just like the daily news , you know . 
i like that .
me , too . 
although they're usually wrong .
georgia here , they're usually wrong too . 
we have weird weather systems . 
but , uh , like i say , as far as , actually listening to the news , it's mostly t v , five o'clock to six thirty . 
uh , that seems like a long time for news 
but that's how long it is . 
and , uh , seems like they have the local news and they have the world news . 
and then , uh , my morning paper . i can hardly wait for it to come . 
 and , uh , 
i'm not a morning person 
so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news . 
i get up just barely in time to get up , get ready and get off to work 
and then at work 
once you get to work , i wouldn't either , 
but i've always been a morning person to get up , you know . 
but i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news 
but anyhow . well , listen , i guess that's about it then . 
it's been nice talking to you tony . 
nice talking to you . 
i'll probably talk to you again . 
i had a friend who was in this 
and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes . 
oh , really ? 
oh , well that hasn't happened to me yet . 
so , you never know , 
it might this time . 
that's right . 
okay , tony . 
take it easy . 
do you have a budget that you go on ? 
uh , it's pretty much a ledger sheet 
and i just write down all my bills , how much i'm going to have to pay 
and i do it per paycheck for me 
uh , i mean i include everything from groceries to insurance to car payments to credit card payments , you know , everything . 
and it tends to work out pretty well that way . 
i can anticipate , you know , a little better . 
i usually try to guesstimate 
and then when the bill actually comes in , i go ahead and fill in the actual amount . 
that way i know how much pocket change i'm going to have left at the end of the month 
so that works okay for me . 
well , my bills i usually know approximately how much they're going to be . 
each month they are more or less just about the same , you know . 
same here . 
 uh , very seldom are they any different . 
and then , uh , like for groceries and everything , we try to put , like , two hundred and fifty dollars in a little can 
 and then that's what we use to buy the groceries with . 
oh , okay . 
and then we put our receipts in there , you know , 
and usually that's enough . 
uh , but i don't have any , you know , small children to have anything extra come up , you know , like , uh , running to the doctor or something like that with them . 
luckily i don't either . 
i mean , you know , 
but , i mean , usually that's not so much that it would throw me off .
in fact , i did have to take my dog to the vet the other day .
 so you know what i'm saying , 
i guess the worst thing i've ever had come out is like car maintenance kinds of things . 
but i do try to build in a little extra money each month to be able to do that type of thing 
 uh , i'm not working right now . 
i worked for p i e 
and then , uh , they went bankrupt 
oh , uhhuh . 
but i only get that once a month . 
oh , that's tough . 
my roommate only gets paid once a month 
so , you know , i really have to try to budget , that i don't go over that amount , you know , each month . 
i , for years got paid once a month 
 and in ways i liked it because i could go ahead and pay all my bills at once . 
there's always one or two stragglers that usually they were , 
for me it worked out that they were the smaller ones 
 but i would pay all of them at one sitting 
and  it  worked okay for me . 
i don't know . 
right now i'm in the mode of trying to dig out of debt , i think as everybody is 
and so , 
 oh , yeah . 
but , uh , it's going pretty well 
and i've got a real good plan mapped out here , 
 i also like longterm christmas club you know . 
i used to belong to a christmas club , 
last year i didn't . 
 so then , naturally , christmas comes along 
and that puts you behind too , you know . 
so this year , now i have them taking out fifty dollars a month out of my 
 oh that's , 
so i figure , you know , that's going to help some . 
that'll cover your gifts come christmas time . 
right , you know . 
that'll be good , 
most people are spending three or four months you know , at least , digging out after christmas 
 and i'm ta , 
i was pretty fortunate this christmas 
i didn't get in debt , 
oh , that's good . 
i'm taking like , uh , sewing lessons to try to learn how to sew better than what i can 
 so i won't have to go out and buy the readymade clothes anymore . 
oh , uhhuh . 
it's so rare 
i know . 
i even bought myself a  surgery   , you know , 
and i just love it . 
i haven't learned everything to do on it yet 
but i figure that will help me save 
my , uh , roommate does sew some 
she hasn't sewed anything in a long time 
but i'm sure that she could pick it up again . 
my mother always sewed . 
she tried to teach me when i was young but 
well , see , some people are , some aren't 
and none of those are really interested in sewing . 
but that's a real good way to save money ,
and then i can also , you know , do some crafts and sell those at garage sales . 
so , which i've been doing . 
well , that's a good way a little extra money . 
well , this is another way that i'm making a little extra money 
so that was , you know , nice that i tripped over this opportunity 
and you're actually my first call . 
oh , really ? 
i had not , uh , done 
i guess today 
 well , have you called ? 
oh , it is ? 
 oh , well , that's nice you know . 
to see if i could get on with somebody , 
 so that was great . 
well i guess that's about all i can talk to about budgets . 
when i was working , i , uh , bought a bond a month out of my , you know , 
they automatically took it out of my 
i have some money taken it and put in a four oh one k , 
so , what sort of car are you interested in getting next ? 
well , actually , i love the car i have . 
i have a chrysler lebaron convertible . 
and i would get another one in a minute . 
unless i could afford what i really like which would be a red ferrari or , you know , a little corvette or something like that . 
and that's what would influence my decision to change because i like a really sporty car . 
and i'd love an expensive one 
 but i probably , 
uh , well i understand and can sympathize with that because i also enjoy driving performance automobiles . 
uh , i currently have an eightyseven , five liter mustang g t 
and i suspect if i were to be able to get another car where object was , uh , 
the best car i could get regardless of money , uh , i probably would be tempted by something along the lines of a lotus or possibly a ferrari . 
well , i'm a nurse here 
and we have a doctor at this hospital that has a beautiful new red ferrari . 
a three twentyeight g t s ? 
and i couldn't tell you 
but it's just beautiful . 
and i go out and i love to touch it 
but i can't even do that because of the alarm . 
 you just go hunting ? 
 so , i just look at it a lot .
go out and lust after it . 
but it sure is a pretty thing .
so have you had the opportunity to drive a ferrari ? 
i really haven't , 
i did 
it was brand new , white , 
it was like a big marshmallow . 
when you sat in the seats , they adjusted to fit around you . 
i mean they came in and up and out 
and i mean , they did whatever 
 and we went for a test drive in that 
and i was able to open that up pretty good 
and that was really fun . 
and i wanted it , 
but i had a choice of that or my house 
and i thought that i'd continue , 
there's something about having a place to live , 
i don't know . 
 you know , it's just necessary . 
and i thought well a tent wouldn't be bad but probably not practical . 
could sleep in the back of the 'vette . 
i find really nice cars . 
they really are . 
it's not like driving a winnebago or something . 
oh , no .
see , i'm not into station wagons and vans and things that people are really buying now 
not really , you know . 
how about 
nice isn't the word i'd choose . 
maybe practical . 
 i mean that , you know . 
isn't that a practical van . 
there's some that are prettier than others 
the new type is prettier than what they used to look like 
but i sure don't think it's attractive , you know . 
it's not like driving a little sports car . 
it's very hard to find something practical that's also attractive . 
i don't think that happens 
i love mine , 
i bought it because i drove a friend's in hawaii 
and i just went home 
and i walked in 
and i picked it out 
and i never did . 
i just went back and signed the papers 
and i knew nothing about my car when i got it . 
i didn't know how anything worked . 
well , so it was a completely new experience for you . 
and i'm sure you enjoyed every minute of it . 
and i've had it , 
it's almost three years actually . 
and i still love it . 
i put the top down everywhere i go . 
i timed it when i first got it 
and it took i mean twenty seconds 
and so , i figured there was nowhere i was to late to go that i didn't have twenty more seconds . 
and you couldn't get , 
twenty seconds , 
that's all it takes . 
i mean , it's just a button , that's it . 
so you don't have to 
 so you won't get , 
and twenty seconds you probably won't get caught in anything too substantial . 
well i did , actually . 
last week going to the airport , 
i just hit a downpour 
and i was on a highway going like eighty . 
so i really did . 
i mean i was soaking wet . 
i thought i would drown .
but it all dried out , you know . didn't 
but it was kind of funny . 
i'm sure people around me really enjoyed it 
 oh . no i was just down in austin last week 
and the weather was pretty nice too . 
 and wasn't it pretty last week with the bluebonnets and everything , 
with the bluebonnets out , 
it really was . 
i decided that austin is certainly someplace that i could handle living . 
a lot of people say that 
and it's pretty far from where i live .
i'm ready if you are . 
um , where do you stand , uh , on , 
well , i think that people should be allowed to have them . 
my son goes hunting . 
he goes deer hunting . 
he goes duck hunting . 
uh , he's read books about guns since he was 
and i just think that , uh , as far as that's concerned , he should be able to have them to go hunting with , you know . 
as far as 
i agree too . 
i , uh , 
as far as the ban goes and everything , i don't think it's possible , uh , to completely ban guns . 
there's just too many . 
well , no . 
there's too many sports people out there that do do these things . 
and i , 
i mean , 
that's true . 
and i mean the technology's not that hard . 
i mean , you could make a gun , you know , from simple , you know , you know . 
you know , you could make one . uh , 
and i think if they want one , they're going to get one . 
 oh , you know 
 you know . 
that's true . 
the bad guys are , you know , 
like i say , if they want a gun they're going to find out 
i mean , 
 uh , stop anybody from getting a gun . 
uh , i think there should be more control as , like , uh , like maybe waiting periods and things like that , you know , uh , 
well i agree with you on that because i know , uh , 
in fact i had bought my son a rifle like for a christmas present one time . 
and for a rifle there's no waiting . 
there wasn't anyhow . 
now there might be now . 
i guess 
but , uh , most of these people that's got these guns that's going around , you know , robbing people and shooting people , 
uh , i know my friend is , uh , really into guns 
and , uh , uh , i went a couple of times with him to gun shows , you know , that 
and , i mean they have anything you'd want , 
i mean 
 you know , you know , anywhere from rifles and semiautomatic weapons and i mean , there's nothing . 
you can just go buy one and take it home 
and it's easier than getting like a video membership card at , you know , a video store . 
 see now , i know they were having a gun show about a month ago 
and i was just wondering how that did work , if somebody wanted to buy a gun at a gun show . 
uh , yeah , 
you just go and , uh , buy the gun 
and , uh , 
there's no restriction though . 
i'm not sure how they do that . 
i know they , 
i was just curious , you know , because , uh 
i know you know , gun shop 
and then they check you out , 
then they call you up 
and you go pick it up . 
i think that's , 
which i think they have to do on rifles and things now too . 
i think there 
anyhow , out here in california , i think there is now . 
i'm not sure , 
i'm not really sure pennsylvania are like . 
now we don't have guns because 
but like i say , my son , he's , 
like , i think his first little rifle that we got him was like he twelve or thirteen years old . 
but to the school to learn how to shoot it . 
he goes to the pistol range 
 and the rifle range to shoot them . 
he likes to go to that , uh , shotgun thing where you shoot at those , uh 
oh , yeah . 
he likes to do that 
 but , uh 
i think they should try to control it and everything , you know . 
but as far as just banning it completely , that's not going to happen . 
i don't think it can happen either . 
i don't see , 
and , then , i think , uh , hadn't thought about this before 
but you know , a black market for them . 
 and so , you know , they would just , 
all the profits would go to , you know , 
now i do believe though , like in california , if a little kid gets a hold of a gun that someone has 
 oh , th , 
the owner's responsibility ? 
you know , now 
or , you know . 
you know , that's true . 
uh , you know , you know , one of the small towns , uh 
and , uh , she said that , uh , you know , he used to always keep his guns locked up and everything like that 
but , i mean , you know , you're , you know , 
people make , you know , 
they forget or , you know , you know , 
kids get in , 
the way kids are , you know , i mean , they can , you know . 
well they can get into almost anything anymore .
unfortunately , we are not much into recycling . 
we don't do enough . 
i know we don't so .
uh , although lately i've been , uh , 
a friend of mine that i spend a lot of time with does recycle quite a bit 
and it's , uh , interesting to watch some of the things that she does 
and then she's almost had an impact on me , uh , where she doesn't say anything to me when she comes to my house but i can kind of tell it bothers her so , 
and i don't do that anymore . 
i don't know why , 
i just don't . ust from socializing with her 
how , uh , is recycling done in your community ? 
there's not a whole lot , 
there really isn't . 
uh , i know in my mother's neighborhood in san antonio , each house has , 
they're given three baskets 
 and they put them out on a certain day of the week 
 and each , uh , home does participate 
but we really don't have anything , uh , close in this area that do anything . 
 and some of the communities that do , the residents are having to pay to participate in it .
over here , they , uh , have several private companies that you can take , uh , recycled ,
but , uh , if you want to take them all to one place , uh , the first saturday of every month , they have certain places that you can drop them off . 
that's what i do . 
uh , and i recycle aluminum , glass , uh , newspapers . 
that's good . 
so it's nice to have , you know , one place that you can take them all to instead of driving the glass to one place 
that's another thing . 
 you have to 
 so that's nice . 
it would be really nice if they , uh , came to the house to pick it up 
and they just were talking about a bill in tucson about that , 
but , uh , uh , it didn't go through . 
but i heard that most homes that do participate in that are having to pay a monthly fee to do that . which , uh , 
i don't know , 
it just doesn't make sense to me . 
i guess uh , was reducing the garbage collection in order to make that up 
uh , so i guess that's one option . 
that's good , 
i guess one thing they're working on now is recycling plastics too . 
 like , uh 
have you noticed that on the bottom of plastic goods , they have this little number now that tells what 
i guess the problem with plastic is there's so many different kinds that you can't recycle , 
you can't just throw all plastic into one recycler . 
oh , i didn't know that . 
so now they're like marking , uh , 
i don't know , 
there's six , seven , eight different kind of plastics 
and they mark on the bottom what kind it is . 
so i guess that makes it easy to recycle 
and then they're , 
so that 
well , that's good . 
i'm , you know , 
unfortunately garland doesn't , 
i don't know , they don't do anything like that 
or you know , i read those little slips that come in to your , utility bills 
and they haven't , you know , talked about doing something like that .
where does your friend go to to recycle ? 
she lives in garland 
and i'm not sure what she does . 
but very heavy in that 
and she takes her own bags to the grocery store .
uh , i really don't think she has any paper products in her house . 
uh , and just a lot of things i've learned off of her that , to start doing . 
and she does make a lot of sense . 
just her whole house is like wow . 
i guess that's how it gets passed on . you know , when one person , you hear 
 and then you pass it on . 
it seems to be catching on , uh , slowly but surely , i guess .
and , uh , my little boy watches a program that was really neat . 
i sat and watched him . 
you know the barney ? 
i don't know if you know the little character barney . 
they had one , uh , on that type of thing 
and how children can do that 
and how to save water when you brush your teeth in water 
and it's really caught on 
and he's only four 
and he's really caught on . 
that's cute . 
that's neat , 
when you , 
and keep the refrigerator door closed and that kind of thing . 
he's really caught on 
so that's really neat .
well , when you start early , i guess , 
how are you doing ? 
i'm doing fine . 
i'm , uh , just editing a spreadsheet right now . 
i'm trying to figure out how i can retire without having to work until i'm ninetyfive . 
we've been doing that too .
we're trying to retire in our fifties . 
this is a very appropriate topic for our , uh , conversation today because what i'm figuring out is that i'm going to have to put in a lot more money than what i'm making .
what is that ? 
i said good luck on that one , then . 
well , we've got a pretty good situation , my wife and i , since our property is already paid for . 
you know , the main things that i like about uh , the job benefits 
you know , they give you an opportunity to either transfer into an on going project . 
so you work for it t i then .
you can't say ? 
yeah . 
well , i work for d i s d 
and i don't know what your talking about when you say health insurance , 
but dallas doesn't pay . 
it pays most of mine , you know , 
now , after you work  i think  five years , they begin to pay most of it . 
but then , for the family , you know , i put my kids on my policy . 
it's like two hundred dollars 
 and it's gone up quite a bit 
and they predict , you know , of course , it's going to keep going up . 
i wish they could go on and pay for all of our coverage , at some point . 
and benefits , you know , 
i'd like to see child care paid for or onsite child care sometime . 
i think that would be a    , 
and it would make women go to work sometime if they knew their kids were being taken care of . 
they could go visit them during the day . 
that's uh , something i hadn't really thought about because we don't have children . 
but , i can see how it would be a real benefit . 
i do . 
well , we keep a shelter , also monies that we're going to pay in for child care too . 
you know , go on and pay a lump sum 
and as long as you pay that amount you're okay . 
but if you paid in more than you actually used , and the same thing for insurance , what you predict your going to be paying for insurance , as long as you actually pay out that amount of money , you're okay . 
but if you pay out less , then you lose that money . 
i don't like that part , 
but you don't have to do that option if you don't want to . 
well , i could see where that would be important . 
and then we got that cafeteria plan , 
do you have that ? 
no . 
i don't know what it's  about  .
you can , uh , 
well you , 
let's see , for insurance . 
it takes it out of your salary before taxes . 
oh , okay . 
pretax insurance ? 
yeah . 
but we call it the cafeteria plan , 
i wonder why . 
i said , i wonder why . 
oh , it's probably what the first guy who did it , called it . 
he was probably in the cafeteria when he thought of it .
so . let's see what else can we do ? 
i'll tell you what we could do . 
we could prohibit people from being hired that are historically going to cost the company money . you know , do a little bit better research on who gets hired 
 because you know , 
you mean , like for health insurance ? 
see , i look at it this way . if the company folds , i got to go find a job . 
now , if we got somebody in a position to affect the way the company performs , just about anybody in the company , and they're not doing their job or they're not capable of doing their job , then we should find a a place to put them or b you know , boot them out . 
well , that's easier done in a company than it is in , uh , school teaching . 
well , frankly , i think school teachers ought to get about ten times what they're getting paid . 
i said , thank you . 
we're both school teachers . 
oh , i'm , 
but it's hard to get rid of a teacher if they're not good . 
i know . 
it's almost impossible . 
well , there's two schools of thought on that . 
you know , i'm looking at trying to get into a university job position as a a professor 
i got about eight years of education ahead of me before i can do that 
 but , once you get that job with the university , you've got ten years of probation . 
then you have tenure . 
and they can't fire you . 
well , you know , in a situation like that , i don't know if that's good or bad . 
i do know that i've had tenured professors that were just sorry . 
and i've also had tenured professors that were the best things on two legs . 
well , they did away with tenure in teaching along time ago , you know , in the public schools . 
but in addition . 
it makes you more at ease . 
you know , you knew you weren't going to lose your job unless you really did something horrendous . 
well , they really can't fire you without cause , 
you know the governments taken care of that , 
but , um , what i'm looking at is , you know , there are a lot of teachers that aren't getting paid what they need to be getting paid , 
and there are some teachers out there that aren't worth having around as janitors . 
you know , and i could see a point protecting someone's position , 
but , on the other hand , i don't think you know , that someone that teaches , uh , say shop , for instance , should have to have degree at all . 
well they don't . 
in some places they don't . 
do they ? 
but , you know , you get specialized education now , for instance , take computer science . 
we've got kids twenty years old , right now , that could beat any computer professor at micro computer applications . 
i know we could . 
and these people can't even get jobs doing anything besides digging ditches , because there's no comprehensive test that they can take , that would allow them to step into that position without having to go through the rigamarole of college . 
you know , i went to college late on in life 
and i realize that hey , it's nothing but four years of endurance 
and you might be teachable , 
you know what i mean ? 
it's my experience that is beneficial , 
but then , you know , like i said , i came in backwards . 
what did you get your degree at ? 
industrial marketing . 
and what's your job now ? 
well , actually i'm selling computer software . 
but , the two are mutually exclusive . because , the experience that got me the job that i got now , was my experience in the construction field , prior to going to college 
all right , 
what else could we change ? 
oh , i'd like to see flexible hours . and teaching ,
well uh , 
well , see , we've got a little bit of it , but not much . 
it would be nice if you had full insurance coverage if you were doing job sharing . 
what else . 
i'd like to be able to evaluate your boss 
and it really carry some weight , 
and you get to choose your boss . 
supervisor evaluations have always been a tough one . especially in my line , because , you know , my supervisor has nothing to with my job , except to make sure i get my check . 
well , so you get to evaluate him though ? 
you know , i mean , what's to evaluate about him , you know , 
i mean , my , supervisor level is like practically zero . 
i run the whole show . 
and when i need something , i tell my boss 
and he gets it for me , because he knows , that i know , what i'm doing . 
you know , and uh , that is something that i think needs to be expanded on , specially in the large market place . you know , the major corporation , because so often , you know , you get a guy who's got eight or nine or ten people working for him in separate areas 
you know , it's hard for me to , you know , especially since i'm in marketing sales , you know , 
i make more than my boss . because he's salary and i'm not . 
i make as much as i earn . 
you know , if i don't make a sale , i don't make anything .
well it's tough , 
but , uh , you know , there are requirements , and quotas , what not , for me to make , 
but , um , the bottom line on that kind of thing is , you know , we have a lot of people , especially in major corporations , who aren't doing a damn thing . 
they're just there . 
you know , the work they do could be totally eliminated , 
and not that they aren't worth or not that they aren't trying or anything . but , it's just that their jobs are useless . 
take , for instance , um , a large construction company i used to work for . ed swampers . 
swampers is a guy , who's in the union . 
he's a laborer . 
and he's assigned to , 
i saw home alone with some friends just a couple days ago . 
i wanted to see it , uh , because there was , uh , much recommended ,
and it was a genre that i wasn't in the least bit interested in , 
and i usually , when i hear about a movie that's supposed to be very good 
i figure , well , i should go see it , because if this is , you know , the best of the genre and i should know about it , or something like that 
right , uhhuh . 
 i feel that way when movies are like blown up , out of proportion , you know 
usually people tell you how good they are , 
and you always , you know , end up with expectations too high or whatever , 
well , the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of , uh , i guess , hollywood movies 
and they're making the movie according to certain formula that's a good formula 
 but they seem to fall short of being really creative with a lot of things , 
i mean 
it's a classic slapstick situation with these bungling burglars trying to get in 
 and , you know , he did some clever things , 
but given the size of the house and how clever the kid was , it seems to me they could have done a lot more , i mean , you know , basically stepping on things and yelling in pain 
 and it seems to me they could have been a lot more creative stuff used . 
i was very surprised that did do a slapstick movie , because that's , uh , not really the way comedies are right now 
 you know , all the comedies are more like jokes and , you know , gags and stuff like that 
there's not as much slapstick anymore . 
well , i guess it was uh , a very successful movie financially , 
 well , that's true , 
it's very cheap to make a slapstick movie . 
it is , 
and i guess you don't have to , but , you know , if you look at oh , 
have you ever seen any of the   movies ? 
excuse me ? 
the french movies that   .
the last movie i saw i guess , uh , was , uh , uh , the one about the frenchman that leaves and comes back , and he's someone different . 
um , he's , uh , 
well , it's about a man , uh , that , uh , leaves his home and comes back to his wife , 
and his wife's all excited 
but the guy that comes back is not her original husband , 
but , um . 
it was a very famous , uh , popular movie . 
norman gray , 
norman gear . 
i'm not with you so far , 
oh , shoot , i'm going to hit myself after i hang up . 
i'll remember the name . 
but , uh , anyway , that was a french movie 
 um , that was the last one i saw downtown , 
but i live in d c 
 the , international films downtown 
oh , yeah . 
 uh , so this , uh , french i guess are into the slapsti , 
i guess they would like jerry lewis , too . 
they have a   
yes they like your lewis much to the chagrin   of sophisticated american everywhere . 
but they have this one guy   who does slapstick comedy , 
and there's something about it that's so innovative , you know , 
he'll have trouble picking up his hat , or catching his umbrella blowing in the wind , or something , 
but there's something about it it isn't just slapstick , 
there's something about the human character in it 
oh , uhhuh . 
 and that's what i find lacking in a lot of , you know , like home alone . 
there was a lot of the human character when he was home alone and he was trying 
and there was a lot of human character there , 
but when it was , the real slapstick moments , him versus the criminals kind of thing , it just sort of lost the human element 
does that make since to you ? 
there's less character development , the funniness of the gag ,
did you go with kids though ? 
 and how it fits with the character  , right . 
excuse me ? 
did you take kids along ? 
it's was a night away from the children . 
oh , i would have liked to have a kid with me , i think , preferably someone seven or eight 
and , you know ,   i would have gotten in trouble the next day , 
i'm sure . 
that's true . 
i was thinking about that too , 
i saw that , um , 
that's why i watched another silly movie , um , um , with my cousin , was uh , uh , the one about um , the turtles , 
oh , teenage mutant ninja turtles . 
i saw that with my cousin , just to see what , you know , what the kids are into 
and your cousin's a kid , 
 and that is , 
anyway , and that was just excessively violent . 
i was worried 
isn't it amazing . 
if kids start imitating that 
it was all bloodless 
 and the good guys can get hit all day long 
 and they have to shake it off 
 they don't , you know , get , uh , epileptics , that sort of thing from getting hit on their head 
 you know , it's a little disturbing the violence in these films , 
partly   it's supposed to be a little bit more okay because it's comic book 
i read an article one time talking about even the quote unquote realistic movies , don't have very realistic upsets of the violence . 
the violence can seem very realistic , 
but the aftermath is usually not there . 
so you see people who are severely injured , very , very badly , lose control of body functions 
they thrash around , 
they scream , you know , uh , 
it's just a very , very bad thing , 
and they never present that , 
even the movies that want to show violence as real , they don't really show you what happens with that real violence 
 and i'm not really sure how i feel about that . 
uh , on the one hand i'd like it to be a warning , 
you're right , 
it's true . 
teenage mutant ninja turtles was sort of the same way , 
 i mean , they know what they're doing , 
and i guess i'm a bit of a snob , they make the movies good enough to be successful 
 but they could make them better , you know 
they could try to make , 
i mean , as far as i was concerned , teenage mutant ninja turtles could have been a classic of world theater 
    , it could have been , you know , 
it was innovative , uh , a completely new approach to making a movie in a lot of ways , 
and yet it ended up not being anything particularly memorable , because and then things like that , 
and they built up , 
from older to younger generation , 
it was a classic greek , you know , you know , a sort of , european mess going back three thousand years that they're playing with 
 um , and he had to    , 
 and then there was a big climactic fight scene , 
and they didn't remember that , 
they didn't fight together , 
they fought individually , 
and they failed individually , 
and then that was it , 
then they had to have the master beat him 
 the master should have died at the end 
and the older generation is not needed 
and is reborn to the younger generation , 
 and all this wonderful mess 
 and it still would have been every bit as accessible a movie for the kids if they had included all this stuff that , i , anyway as an intellectual adult would appreciate , 
it wouldn't have hurt the movie to do that , 
and it would have make it , uh , broadened the audience that it could have been targeted for , i thought 
 but , you know , i'm truly an intellectual snob ,
i realize that . i mean , to go to these movies and expect them to be , you know , other than just good entertainment 
that's true . 
there's not too many that you wouldn't want to change something , 
and there's always something that , uh , 
i'm very critical , 
i'm actually originally from hollywood , 
and then 
 and my father works in films 
and such , 
and i tend to be hypercritical 
and then , i must admit i enjoy these movies 
 and that's what they're for , 
but i don't remember them , 
and i can think of movies i have less fun during 
and then after the movie's over , i remember it so terribly well 
there are several movies that hit home like that . 
of course the ones i always remember are the older ones 
i always like the musicals , and uh , 
they leave , 
they leave some songs with you , 
i don't know what it is 
 but it just , 
i mean , i don't know if this is old fart talking here 
  you know , those old movies seemed to have had something 
i don't know what it was . 
um . okay , 
well , i guess i got to get going , 
well , um , thanks for hearing me rap , i guess .
got to go take care of the children , 
all right , 
nice talking with you . 
nice talking with you . 
are you calling from texas , by the way ? 
oh , okay , 
the first person i've talked to outside of texas . 
there must be texas people , as near as i can tell . 
well , thank you very much . 
well , i'm from the   .
all right , 
we're rolling . 
i , uh , 
has your experience lead you to advise , uh , if my child were thinking of going to the air force academy , 
what would you say ? 
well , i'd encourage it . 
it's a good general a bachelor's degree . 
any post graduate program there , 
but you get an excellent , wide , uh , basis of topics . 
you know , you get a good broad education out of it . 
they don't graduate the best engineers or the best english majors , but 
how do you feel about , 
it must be a somewhat different environment from a regular college . 
how does that , uh , 
how do you feel that is for someone at that phase in their life ? 
well , that stage in their life . 
uh , other people , 
 uh , it's , uh , suffocating , 
you know , you kind of choke on it 
 uh , it depends on the person , 
but , uh , the one factor i think more than anything else in this day and age that's got to be a big factor in your decision's just how much you're going to pay 
and if you've been in for twelve years , i'm sure you've , 
well , i sort of , 
one of the reasons it's taken so long is i've been working you know , 
so i'm actually managing to do this with zero debt . 
oh , that's good . 
uh , you couldn't do it otherwise . 
oh , or that i went to high school with that went to civilian colleges 
and they've got twenty , thirty thousand dollar debts , 
i mean you could have , uh , 
i think if there's any major piece of advice is to find a way of getting an education that doesn't incur that kind of debt . 
it's not , 
i mean , i remember seeing an article one time about , you know , if the average person who spent that much money going to college just took the same amount of money and put it in an investment fund , they'd be considerably wealthier than they would be from the job they'd get after college . 
so , it's really kind of crazy . 
it's staggering when you think that , just here in central new york , is , uh , 
hamilton college is just you know , maybe about twenty miles to the south from where i am 
 and , uh , they're looking for twentytwo thousand dollars for tuition and room and board now . 
a year . 
at just a small , 
i mean it is a select , 
i know . 
i was thinking of trying to get a job there .
i heard of it . 
oh , yeah . 
but , you're talking incredible tuitions now . 
i don't know how many people actually pay the whole shot . 
very few i would imagine . 
but , uh , i get , 
i just couldn't ima , 
i mean it's more money that i make in a year , 
so  , 
you know , it , you know , 
me being one person with a above the median income ,
i'm a second lieutenant in the air force now , 
even as a somebody making twice what i was making , how could you put half of that into , 
and then just when they make it to the college years it's , 
my god , i can't imagine . 
well , about the purpose of undergraduate education is it's really the time , 
you do get an education , you do learn some things , 
but you eventually forget most of it . 
but what you don't forget is the growing up . 
it's really the period when people become adults . 
i mean people who don't go to college become adults in other ways . 
but , really , 
it's the entry into adulthood , i think . 
and i think that the best way to choose a college is to decide what kind of environment you want to be fostered in you know , as you gain new social skills , as you become , you know , more of a functioning member of society . 
and maybe the air force academy is a perfect , 
as you said for someone you know , who needs to learn selfdiscipline and so forth would be appropriate for them . 
or , it's also a good environment , 
it may be good for someone who already has self discipline , who has a certain amount of leadership quality in their own ,
and want to develop that . 
and , that , 
the s , 
it's the same . 
it can benefit different people different ways . 
but , uh , you know , again , from high school ,
and it's like frozen time , you know . 
i find it kind of sad , 
i really do . 
it is . 
it really is that they haven't found anything better that , uh , 
or their experiences haven't been broadened at all ,
in a college environment and discuss some issues and really sit there with people with disagreeing opinions 
and you hear all these different sides of the story 
 and , uh , that's another big thing i think people get out of college is the appreciation for differing points of view ,
in high school everyone sort of tries to have the same opinion it seems . 
yeah , 
the one thing i think that's no good for anyone is these monster institutions . 
these institutions of thirty thousand students and such . 
oh i , 
and i see some freshmen wandering around in there 
and  , they're just like , you know , someone from the country lost in the big city , 
i mean , 
i don't see them getting , 
i mean when i was undergraduate , i went to a , relatively small school for my first two years 
and then i transferred to a very large school . 
and that worked out pretty well . 
i went from you know , a second rate institution to a higher rate institution . 
but the first couple of years it doesn't matter to me what the quality of the education was . 
i needed to make friends . 
i needed to sort of learn the ropes . 
you know , there were things like that , that mattered a lot more 
and i needed really simple education that you can get , pretty much anywhere for the first couple of years . 
well , your education's a lot what you make of it , too , 
and if you're alienated , 
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having psychological problems ,
well , i've seen more graduates from m i t 
and that , 
i work an air force laboratory 
and so we've got a lot of , uh , m i t graduates that are in there 
and they are the biggest collection of screwed up people that  , i think i've ever run into . 
even more so , uh , like , military academy grads are a strange lot , too , 
 confess to that . 
it's sort of a rare select environment . 
and they have their own quirks and tolerances and ,
and then certain things that 
things we do , 
the way we do it that drive other people nuts that , 
but , these m i t grads are off in their absolute own world . 
it's a , 
i have a lot of respect for m i t master's and doctorate , uh , 
it's a top rated institution 
and now i , 
but they're undergrads are like , 
at that's a lot of them even graduated . 
but , uh , i don't know . 
well , i had known a lot of undergraduates who pick schools because they want the best reputation for a school .
and you're not going to see the professors 
 you know , you're going to see some t a , you know . 
 uh , so you know , they want the best 
and they think what the best is , is ,
and that's a one standard , 
but it's not relevant ,
it's interesting that you mention , 
and i didn't think about that before when you were talking , 
but the service academies have is military with a few exchange ,
but , uh , having the military faculty is really beneficial because they see it as doing their job and spending time with the cadets there , uh , is investing in the air force , 
and it , 
or the military itself , it's the future officer corps 
and so , i hear horror stories from friends of mine that they could never see their instructors , 
they could never get extra help . 
for me any time i needed extra help any time of the day 
 and could call them , 
you go to their office anytime . 
i had some instructors that , uh , would invite me over to their house for extended study things on weekends ,
you won't get that at m i t  virtually  or anything like that . 
and that , 
 you know , and you can't blame the professors either ,
you'd s , you know , 
teaching is third down on the list of importance things 
publish first , 
and the  , 
 and that's appropriate if the university is trying to do serious research , because it's hard to be a researcher and a teacher at the same time . 
so i'd say go to a college that has teachers . 
people who really are committed to the students and can afford to be because that's their job . 
but , oh , well .
ever consider 
and , uh , i don't know , 
maybe , i wonder if  they enter  these conversations that people have been having , uh  . . . 
what kind of fishing do you enjoy ? 
well , uh , normally i like just like to try and catch anything that's swimming , because i've had such problems with trying to catch any type of fish , that , uh , i just really enjoy doing the boat type fishing . 
so , you like fresh water . 
oh i see .
 well , one of these days , i'm hoping they'll have some kind of medicine , 
so i can go out and go , uh , deep sea fishing . 
now , that would be nice . 
well , i was raised on the texas gulf coast ,
and during the christmas holidays we'd go down to our house on the coast 
 and so , i thought fish came out of the ocean 
oh , my goodness . 
 and anything that was fresh water was muddy 
 so i didn't learn to fish in a lake until i was well into my twenties 
 so a sea fisher type 
oh i bet it is . 
there's so many different ways to catch fish . 
you know , at night you can go walking in the shallows , and gig flounder and things like that . 
which isn't technically fishing , 
but it's a lot of fun . 
so , i grew up fishing . 
what area of lakes do you like ? 
well , uh , now , i haven't done much fishing here in texas , uh , because i moved from ohio , 
oh , i see . 
uh , but , uh , we did a lot of fishing when we were up there . 
but down here , i have a brother that likes to go over on the east , in east texas , and do fishing . 
i can't remember what the name of the lake is , 
and he was just here this past weekend . 
i could have , 
i think he mentioned it again , 
but i couldn't remember what it was . 
uh , i want to call it salt fork , or lake fork . 
i can't remember , 
but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places . 
 oh , oh , oh , uh , i think i know where , uh , lake caddo , or something like that . 
i , you know , 
that may be it . 
if it's supposed to be one of the best bass fishing places . they hold tournaments there , and everything . 
and he said that he has never gone anywhere before , 
and he's fished all over the united states , in which they can catch the biggest bass that you've ever seen . 
so i would love to go over there . 
they were talking about going over there , some time in the spring , 
and i was thinking it would be great to go over there to go fishing , uh , and catch some bass . 
i would love to do that , 
but they have snakes over there , 
and i'm not too welcome around , 
i really don't want to share a boat with a snake . 
i don't see it . 
i think that i perhaps would let them have the boat or something , 
i'd make some quick arrangements 
that's true . 
 and i've told so many stories about the snakes 
 you know , when they pull in , there's a snake instead of a fish ,
i'm just , 
i don't know , 
what's the largest fish you ever caught ? 
i think it was only like three and a half pounds , 
and for me that's big . 
that's why i'm saying i love to go fishing because i've never caught anything really , really big . 
uh , so , because it's always been , you know , on a lake , and , uh , 
i know they have bigger fish than that 
but , you know , three and a half pounds , was ,
oh , on a lake , 
that's a good size fish .
i would be impressed .
 uh , but 
i'd love to go catch like the  marlins  or whatever in the deep sea fishing . 
i've never done that . 
i've seen it , uh , 
and i have no problem going out in a boat , uh , 
it's just so dreadfully expensive , 
and there's just so many other ways   live down there . 
it's not a treat 
it's what you do every day . 
that's right . 
you know . 
uh , one of my favorite things was , we were forever catching crab and steaming them 
 and that's it . 
uh , but , the other little creatures would take care of what was left . 
that's right , 
well , do you live like along , uh , houston ,
i lived in dallas . 
oh , okay . 
but you , uh , 
we had a house in port aransas . 
oh okay . 
it's a little fishing village that is ,
that's close to , uh , 
oh corpus . 
it's like if you drew a line from austin straight down , it would be in that region . 
small island . 
i've been to port aransas 
but , it was when i was a child . 
oh , okay . 
because i have relatives who live in houston , 
 and we would go to port aransas or then , on down to corpus or further , 
like what your talking about . 
because i was just wondering , we went to galveston this summer , even with all the oil spills and everything , 
i mean , i was , 
was it bad ? 
i well never , ever go back . 
i don't think . uh , 
oh , i hate to hear that . 
and that's true , uh , uh , you know , 
the water was murky , 
and i would hate to think about catching fish or anything there 
huhuh , 
i wouldn't want to eat them . 
you went to galveston . 
uh , i have a favorite hotel that extends out over the water 
 uh , what is it , the flagship ? 
is it still there ? 
i like that place . 
it most certainly is , it was certain things that were enjoyable about it , 
but , uh , i think it's lost a lot of it's appeal since then , because of all the oil spills that they have had , 
and , uh , it always smelled the entire time we were there . 
it was , 
i didn't realize that had happened ,
we went swimming one time , in the whole week that , we were there , 
and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool , because the water was so awful , 
well , of course , being raised on the water i'd never swim in it . 
swimming is for swimming ,
that's why they call them swimming pools .
that's where you swim . 
you do not swim in the ocean . 
not anymore . 
i've seen what comes out of the ocean , 
and i have no desire to share ,
 but huge sharks 
i mean incredibly large sharks . 
uh , some of the young dread naughty boys in my family would fish for them all night 
it was incredible the size of them , 
  the next morning they would have them strung up across the  getties  
 and it , you know , 
so , just strung up , 
their tails would still hang on the bottom of the  getties  
now i never knew they were that big , huh , 
  i won't have anything to do with . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
well , it certainly was , uh , .
maybe you can get , 
how many , 
have you had very many of these calls ? 
 uh , yeah , 
how wonderful . 
almost ever single day from when they started it . 
maybe i'll just be so lucky . 
i enjoyed talking to you . 
well , i , um , 
so this has been the first opportunity i've had to , uh , be working on my own lawn and garden , 
and , uh , you know , back when i was a kid , you know , mom would send me out to weed the garden . 
i'd hate it , you know . 
now , i sort of take pride uh , in the yard , and , you know , how the place looks , 
 uh , so i don't mind doing it so much anymore . 
so do you have a garden , 
or do you just do your landscaping now and your lawn ? 
you know , i've got some , uh , bushes around the you know , foundation planning , things like that , 
and then there's just some little flower beds , 
and my mom grows , 
she's an avid gardener , 
and she starts her own stuff from seed now , 
and she gets a little over zealous when she is planting these seeds in the wintertime and starting them . 
uh , she ends up with so many plants that she can't fit them all in her garden . 
they have a huge yard and a huge house , 
and so she brings them up here from philadelphia and gives me all her extras . 
well , that's pretty good . 
my sister is very over zealous , too . 
she's got some really nice flower beds . 
she puts a lot of time into them . 
this is my first year in a house where i'm thinking about doing some flower beds and stuff . 
oh , i've always had crude ones at my father's , 
his house is more like a farm house . 
it's not on a main road . 
my house is on a main road , 
and it has nothing .
i mean , nothing . 
but , um , what i do do , and i've always done it is , 
at my father's house , my sister and i have a couple of gardens . 
i think we figured out total , this is for vegetables 
so we each have a third of an acre we do . 
that's a lot .
that's amazing . 
well , it's my dad's , 
and he's been there for a long time 
 so , um , it just happens they built a shopping center next to it 
oh , jeez . 
 but , um , they put up a nice fence , 
so we still have a lot of privacy , 
and we grow a lot of food . 
uh , i enjoy it , 
um , the gardens are kind of old , 
you have to step down in them now 
but there's still , 
we , my sister uses probably a fertilizer . 
i don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing . 
but i wish this phone would stop screeching , 
are you getting a lot of static on your end of the line ? 
i'm trying , 
i don't know if it's my phone . 
this is bad . 
it's not getting any better . 
i can't even hear what you're  , 
oh , okay . 
oh jeez , 
it's gone . 
i don't think my phone really does that , 
but every time i have this phone is a little weird , 
i mean it's been dropped on the floor a hundred times . 
well , i don't know , 
there was 
well , whatever it was , there was a second there 
i couldn't even hear what you were saying , 
but , um , 
i was beating on the phone going , 
can you hear me . 
i guess i was having a hard time there too . 
i thought it sounded , 
but , uh , 
i mean , that's a heck of a pla , 
you must have a lot of different stuff you get out of there , 
especially up in vermont there , you should have , uh , some really nice soil . 
we grow a lot of , uh , the basic , corn , potatoes . 
she likes to really get into her pumpkins 
and see how many she can grow . bas , corn , potatoes , 
and , uh , acorn squash are good winter keepers . 
i mean , things the way we grow are carrots , cabbage , that sort of   goes to waste 
 you know , we , 
just too much . 
she starts her own plants . 
she plants a lot of tomatoes 
i let her do all the planting and putting , 
and the back work , and stuff . 
but she helps me a lot , too . 
she puts a lot of financial . 
she plans it all out . 
beans like to be near certain types of plants . 
now , they find that tomatoes don't do well if you put them next to something like , uh , peas , 
i don't know . 
oh , really 
because of like the crosspollination , 
i guess it's just what scents it gives off , 
they just don't like each other . 
i mean , she reads all kinds of books , 
so . i wish i knew more to tell you why , 
huh . my mom put , uh , cantaloupes and cucumbers near each other once , 
and the got cross pollinated by the bees 
 and we ended up with looked like round big huge round cucumbers . 
oh , that's really weird . 
i mean , these were like some mutant . 
i've put my cucumbers down at one end of the garden 
and like i'll make an l shape i've put my cantaloupe . 
so they've been pretty close together . 
but i don't think the vines . 
they don't have to be touching or anything , 
like you say , they cross pollinate just by bees , 
it's just like the bees and insects will do it . 
either that or my mom just had some bad seed or something . 
something weird . 
this last season it was too wet up here 
we lost a lot of our root things , our squash and our potatoes , 
and we got half our yield . 
oh , well . 
it was really bad because of the water . 
when i , 
my family used to live in littleton , massachusetts , 
and when we moved in there we had a really wet backyard , 
and , uh , my mom wanted a vegetable garden . 
so we trucked in , uh , 
i think it was seven , what was it , cubic yards , 
i think that's how they measure dirt 
seven yards of sand . 
i got to shovel it all , lots of fun . 
i have to do that , 
i want to make some flower beds , 
and i'm going to have a seven yard truck come in with some top soil . 
and i'm going to , 
my problem is i want to use those rail ties to build up a planter 
 but i don't know if the creosote in the rail ties is going to do something , you know , if i want to grow a tomato or something 
well , it seems , 
 i mean , i guess it'd go with my flowers . 
i've seen a lot of people use them , you know , for flower beds , 
but i don't know creosote would do anything , 
i mean , 
 i just don't think you , 
i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird 
 but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering . 
and i don't know if they make landscape ties that aren't treated . 
but they put ,
oh , that's right . 
there's bad chemicals in those too . 
well , i'm not really worried about it , 
it's mainly for flower bed , 
so i'm just not going to put that tomato plant in there . 
all right . 
but , i , 
i do want to have a raised bed . 
i've never , 
my flower gardens are always been like on the ground . 
it just looks so much better when it's up against the house , tiered up . 
well , you can see it a little better 
and it stands out . 
this house that i have is just a three bedroom ranch 
and i can tell you there's nothing around it , cement 
there was a lilac tree , 
people would kill to have a lilac bush 
 and he's cutting it down .
so . that's all right . 
flower beds are all right . 
anything , as long as it doesn't rub up against the siding . 
rub up against the siding . uh , 
that's what he's worried about . the trees , or a bush , because lilac bushes , they grow fast . 
some people , uh , would really like to have them , 
and then the people that do have them , they spread , and they sprout all over their lawn . 
so , they're kind of a pain , 
but , you know , people who don't have them think they're great . 
and people who do have them ,
another thing i have that , um , is weird is a locus tree in the back yard . 
as a matter of fact there's three of them , very badly trimmed , 
they aren't trimmed at all . 
and i can imagine if i had to mow the lawn in the back , which we said we'd do , if the trees hang down 
and the locus trees have like three quarters of an inch thorns on it . 
they're like , 
i think i've seen those before , 
but i don't remember what they look like . 
they're a pretty tree , 
but when you walk up to them they're covered with thorns . 
so we're going to get a chain saw and limb it extensively so it gets the trees up overhead , 
so it'll give you room to get under it , 
because i can just see brushing up against it , that it would 
it's worse than a rose bush . 
many times worse , because of course , it's a tree . 
oh , a tree   is always something very nice to have . 
my dad used to work on them , 
so i don't think i'll have a problem . 
my husband will have problems borrowing one . 
then you got to get him to , 
if he's going to do it , you've got to twist his arm to get him to go do it . 
well , if that's not the problem  . . . 
did you vote in the last , uh , national election ? 
oh , that's good . 
did you get to vote at the last one ? 
if i got the last local one . 
oh , uhhuh , 
and sometimes the local ones aren't as publicized it seems that , uh , they should be . 
you're not sure where to go and vote and all that . 
and , uh , there's usually nobody running against , you know , the incumbents . 
or you don't know you know , where they stand or anything like that . 
i feel that , uh , a lot of people have gotten lazy about voting . 
i think you're right . 
 and , they're , 
and also they're fed up with the system , 
or sometimes they don't like either of the choices 
the lesser of the two evils is how we usually look at it . 
especially in texas .
the last gubernatorial race oh it was awful . 
it really was , 
so i don't know , 
it'll be interesting to see how the next , uh , few years go . 
did they get the serious problem that half the people don't vote . 
and i think it could get worse . 
you know , we get this lackadaisical attitude , 
then , you know , uh , it could lead to some serious things . 
it also seems like maybe another candidate that nobody wants could slip in 
right , uh , 
 you know , had enough pull . 
it's kind of like in louisiana where that , uh , guy that's like a ku klux klan 
kind of scary when you think about that . 
and , uh , who's the other guy , larouche  , that , uh , is sort of the , uh , socialist , not socialist but comm , 
he's so off the wall that , uh , he's gone in and tried to get into city elections 
he's been put away for , uh , credit card fraud , i believe . 
oh , gosh . 
lyndon larouche , that's it . 
and , uh , 
yeah , 
next thing you know , you've got him . 
you know , i like what he says , 
and he'll be so far off the wall that they'll elect him . 
right , yeah . 
that's what i thought . 
he sure did . 
 uh ,    , but you know , they can always fool us , you know . 
he might do a good job . 
i think one thing that maybe would help people vote is if the polls were either open more days , or you could mail it in , or something like , if you have real strict work hours , and you can only go like at seven in the morning or after work and you have to stand in line for so long 
oh , yeah . 
i think that discourages a lot of people . 
what we do , usually , is , uh , vote , uh , absenteeism 
and , uh , i know , here , you know , you don't have to have any reason , 
you can just go and vote 
 and the polls are open , what was it , a couple of weeks , 
the hours are good 
and they're even open on saturdays 
and so we've got plenty of time to go , because down here in houston , uh , the lines are long . 
i'm in dallas , 
and they're long here too . 
 uh , but , uh , 
i voted absentee one year . 
i really was going to be gone . 
so , i did it , 
but , uh , it was nice . 
i would be tempted to do it again . 
well , uh , i recommend it , because you just walk right on in , and there's usually not anybody in line 
 and , uh , you know , that vote's just as good as , you know , the one on election day . 
i think they should change the whole system so that it's easier 
i think more people would do it if it wasn't such a hassle . 
um , yeah , 
i've been involved with , uh , some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the republican party . 
and it's really interesting to see the process as far as what goes through as far as the voting and uh , the not the ballots , 
but , uh , my mind has gone blank . 
i've been   all evening .
 you know , the views , and , uh , you know , everybody gets to vote on , you know , well , should he be for this and on and on and on , 
and , uh , it's interesting . 
that would be . 
i usually vote . 
a lot of times i'll vote a straight party ticket just because i don't take the time to find out you know , other than the major candidates , what they stand for 
so i'll just trust well , the party kind of goes along these lines so i'll go ahead and vote . 
there for a while , that worked . 
 uh , i know i have , um , 
 you know , sometimes i'll stick to a certain party , depends on the guy . 
but , uh , if it , uh , gets down between two , then i'll vote for the party 
or , you know , they're both just as bad , 
 um , but 
you know , that's not the best way 
i guess it'd be best if you knew each person and what they stood for and why and everything . 
but it gets to the point where , 
i mean , you've got to and be able to find the information about what he stands for . 
and try to determine if what you read was objective or not . 
or what you've heard on t v , which i think is just outrageous . 
i don't agree with how the media handles elections . 
 you know , i'm tired of hearing about the polls , you know , you know , 
this is how he stands such and such a day 
it's just ridiculous . 
i think it could affect the outcome , you know , could make it unfair . 
it really could , 
and , uh , then , sometimes , how the media will blow things out of proportion and will run an issue into the ground which is good and dead , 
and they keep dragging it on , 
and it could hamper the outcome of an election for the guy that should have won . 
oh , yeah . 
yeah , 
so , uh , 
the press has a lot of power . 
they really do . 
i sometimes think that that should be limited more . 
oh , but , boy you try get into that , 
you'd really open a can of worms . 
oh , yes , 
or they , i agree with the freedom of the press , you know , and all the amendments , 
but sometimes it's for the public's own good that we don't hear things . 
seems that they should regulate themselves a little bit , 
and i don't think they ever care to . 
they don't . 
well , i can't think of anything else really about the polls or voting , to talk about . 
well , i enjoyed talking to you . 
well , it was good talking to you . 
all right . 
so do you all keep a budget ? 
and we never have a problem meeting it from paycheck to paycheck . 
it's pretty neat being that independently wealthy and working for a major semiconductor firm , 
you can just spend it well . 
are you being smart , 
or are you serious ? 
i'm being facetious . 
i'm being very comical . 
uh , we have a budget , um 
i kind of look at it for more of a , 
we have that , uh , 
i guess the financial planners , the training now . 
we've had it for about four years here . 
got our businesses and our life in line , how to manage credit cards , how to put away , say for , you know , money markets and this kind of thing . 
and , there's some freebies out there 
you should put ten to fifteen percent of your monthly bring home 
that being money market , uh , bonds ,    ,   savings , uh , or just a liquid account 
um , you should always have three months of your salary in a savings account in case there's a major need for that . 
you should always have an umbrella permit that bridges your life insurance and your medical and your , uh , uh , car insurance in case you run into a lawyer and you break his arm . 
he's going to sue the pants off of you . 
these kind of things are about a hundred dollars a year . 
some of them are there to pacify situations . 
and some of them are there to prevent things from happening . 
but , uh , i guess we kind of got away from about the last sixteen months as far as saying , two hundred dollars for food and three hundred dollars for this and two hundred for that because we had a child which is about a year old , 
and then 
i've been developing it , 
but it's kind of hard . 
diaper prices are going up , you know , and formula and stuff , you know . 
that's funny . 
we have a , 
we're twenty eight , and he's been working at t i for five years , 
and that was pretty much his first really major job of any , you know , professional , because he had worked , you know , part time during school and what not , 
and , uh , he was a little late graduating , 
so we're , you know , uh , 
and we have a nine and a half year old son , 
and it's because , you know , we were eighteen when we had him , 
so , we're kind of looking at this from the other aspect of ,
you know , we have like a nice house . 
people , you know , are really shocked at how nice everything is in our house . 
but , we don't , you know , live in a brand new house , either , maybe a ninety , hundred thousand dollar house 
 but we're in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for fortyfive thousand . 
so , you know , we have tradeoffs . 
 so we have a monthly budget with this , this , this , this . 
but , we have no savings , which isn't real wise , 
but we don't have the income at this time really to have any , because we have three debts that we're trying to pay off from both of our student loans . 
we're still paying 
and we have one car payment that i think we have about thirteen months left on it . 
and after that , we either , 
what we want to do is begin doubling up our car payment , um , 
they'll pay , 
our car payment is equivalent to both of our student loans . 
so what we want to do is next year keep driving the same cars and , um , pay on the student loans , split that car payment in half and pay , you know , double up payments on both our loans . 
and it'll work out perfect . 
do you have your , uh , loans through the texas credit union ? 
thing about the credit union on the loan . 
if you go up there and write them a two thousand dollar check it doesn't all go towards principal . 
they take out for the finances 
it's like one of these lose or swim type of credit , 
one of those loans is . not really the best in the world , 
since your husband is , um , a t i er 
but doesn't have the loans with the credit union , they're offering something that might be worth 
i don't know what your percent is on your car payments 
 but they'll take any t i noncredit union loan 
oh , really . 
one of the secretaries we have down here is paying twelve percent through g m a c or something . 
and she's doing it . 
i mean , it's like . 
does she have to pay to have it refinanced ? 
t i er to , 
we got ripped off buying our new car . 
we both come out of , uh , drugs and stuff , 
and we became christians about five years ago . 
right when he got home from terrell . right before he got hired for t i , he had gotten saved and stuff , 
and so , i mean , when you get come out of drugs and stuff , you have nothing , 
i mean , you know , you don't have anything . 
you have the clothes on your back , 
and you might have a car , and that kind of thing . 
and so , uh , you know , we really felt like god told us to buy a new car because he had an older car that was going to need to be fixed and high gas . 
but we got ripped off on it because we wanted it financed at four years , 
and we were young 
and we'd look about nineteen . 
people still think we're about , 
they ask us where we go to high school when we get our hair cut and stuff , both of us . 
and so , it's just kind of strange , you know , 
so five years ago we probably looked like real ding dongs , you know . 
so we went in , and the financed the car for five , 
and we didn't know that . 
we got kind of taken , just a little bit . 
so we're kind of upset that we're having to , you know , pay this fifth year on the car , because it was just not a wise thing . 
but we learned a good lesson . 
 so , you know . 
well , uh , five years is not that bad of a problem only because you're paying more interest , 
but your payments are lower . 
but would have only been about twenty dollars a month higher , 
and he want , 
oh , really . 
and they came back 
and they said that they had it figured for five 
and we'd already signed the papers . 
and i might have been there . 
i don't remember hearing that . 
but , i also wasn't the one in charge of it , 
so i wasn't paying as close of attention . 
but , anyway , instead of putting our foot down about it , we just went , okay , whatever , you know . 
so anyway , 
so next time we'll do that different . 
we want to next time pay cash for our car , too . 
we want to pay cash for everything we can possibly do . 
when we buy a house , we attended a bill   financial seminar , 
and he has a lot of wisdom on that , just on biblical , you know , principles to 
he runs the largest real estate company in fort worth debt free . 
and we really believe in debt free living and debt free car buying and debt free house buying . 
and if we do take out a loan on a house in the future , what we'll do is pay because you save a lot in interest , just doing that . 
and then , 
you save a lot . 
and you need to be very careful , 
they call it a yuppie loan , if it's set up for bimonthly 
if you , 
because you'll save fifteen to seventeen years off the end of the loan . 
 i'm sorry , seven to nine years off the end of the loan . 
and there is a local firm that'll actually , 
like in my situation , i don't have that , because the loan was not available . 
i can have , 
this firm will pick up my loan for a six hundred fifty dollar fee . 
so i can cut that much off the end of , 
but i'm not interested because we're moving out of the house next year . 
oh really . 
but , uh , those are all great . 
the interesting thing , we're getting ready to have a house built 
it's not , a lot of the firms that offer , 
mortgage loan firms , aren't offering , um , that loan . 
you can ask and you can wheel and deal , 
but it's not as 
it's a great idea . 
hell , i'd love to cut ours in half , 
but , uh 
and if you figure , get with a financial person . 
and you can figure up exactly when like the eighteenth month of a loan , if you make like a four hundred dollar payment over and above your house payment 
it has a magic with numbers . 
it'll shave almost , you know , x number of dollars off , 
 we've become aware of that . 
there's a loan officer through our church , too , that i think could help us better . 
you know , he does that full time with the bank , you know . 
and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know , that , you know , we know are people of integrity . 
you know , that is another thing that , you know , 
we feel like our long term goal is going to be benefitted by next time 
we buy a car we're not just going to go to toyota of irving , you know , 
we're going to go to somebody that we know , 
we're going to take someone with us older , 
and we didn't do any of those things . 
somebody you trust . 
you know , there are so many ripoff artists here in this town . 
 uh , it's really a sin , 
it really is . 
i got taken on firewood . 
i mean , uh , uh , the guy shorted us a half a cord of firewood , 
and my wife didn't know , 
and i stopped payment on the check , 
and he'd already been paid by a cashing firm . 
they're suing me on this , 
and it's for a hundred and thirtyfour dollars . 
oh , my . 
absolutely pathetic . 
i stopped payment on a check . 
oh , that's funny . 
oh , this last week , we bought a sewing machine at zak's , 
and then i found that you could get the same machine better for less locally . 
not much less , but it was enough less , 
and i found they locally serviced it . 
and we just stopped payment on the check . 
so i hope they don't sue us over it .
but we never received any merchandise either , 
so i don't think it would hold any , 
oh , okay , 
probably something like that , 
did you call them and tell them you just . 
we just did it . 
maybe my husband should call today . 
might be a good idea , because you're going to get , what , a check , 
well , this is kind of ironic because i work in t i s legal department . 
do you ? 
and although we don't have any criminal actions here , we do have other , um , lawsuits that do go to trial from time to time . 
and , uh , when was it , 
a couple weeks ago i was asked to go to , uh , jury duty 
i wasn't selected 
but , um , for some of our cases in particular we have , um , very technical cases from time to time because of like our patents and such . 
and it's very difficult for lay people for somebody who might just , you know happen to be selected in our jury , to understand what we're talking about . 
well , i do think that the cases uh , oh , say something like texaco versus pennzoil , 
 or the texaco pennzoil problem ,
you know , some   i don't , 
you always have the option , 
now in criminal i guess you always have a jury , 
but in civil cases you have the option of whether you want a jury or not . 
oh , is that right ? 
and in some incidences i think they ought not to have a jury , 
 uh , or there should be some way where it could be opted for them not to have a jury . 
uh , i was only on one jury ever ,
and , uh , it really was a pretty trivial , case 
and it seemed to me all the time i was thinking of all these people in the courtroom over the case that involved , oh , a couple thousand dollars i think ,
and it finally ended up that , uh , even though we had reached a verdict before we were allowed to give it , they settled the case . 
they had settled while we were deliberating . 
now , the one thing i did approve of there was that we didn't have to be unanimous because it was a civil case . 
and , uh , we were split , uh , ten to two 
so , it was , uh , a good thing that , it wasn't a total waste of time to have a hung jury on a case that trivial . 
well , um , i've never fully served , 
i mean , i've been asked twice to go down 
but i didn't get elected on the panel , 
but , i know , that , um , for a lot of the civil cases it's rare , 
i mean , if your a lawyer , um , there , you could be a lawyer who never actually gets into the courtroom  , 
there's a lot of attorneys like that , that never get to the courtroom . 
their kind of law doesn't get them to the courtroom , 
but even in , um , litigation which is doing lawsuits , is a lot of times that you never get to the courtroom itself 
well , i think that the trial in a sense , is kind of a threat to hold over people to try to get them to reach an agreement out of court ,
but it's a shame that , oh , 
it's not so bad for the court system because the money there isn't being spent 
but there's awful lot of money in time and effort spent in preparing for trial only to then finally get scared enough by going to the court 
and usually it's the scare kind of the jury because you really don't know one way or the other how that jury is going to feel . 
you could feel that you really have a very strong case and that you're very much right 
but the jury may or may not see it that way , 
i was a witness in a criminal case . 
and it was absolutely horrifying to me how that operated because so much evidence was excluded , 
and that the jury was never allowed to hear 
and they convicted the defendant , on as far as i could tell , very flimsy evidence and two perjured testimonies . 
and i knew the people involved , the people who d and the people who , uh , were defendants . 
i think that was just a horrible miscarriage of justice because of the , uh , you know , staying by the absolute strict rules and not allowing things to be presented to the jury , that , uh , were highly irrelevant to the case and could , i thought , have established the defendant's innocence . 
so , uh , i do , 
although i'm a lawyer's daughter and i have lawyer's ,
and it seems a lot of times uh , especially in criminals that , their rights are so protected 
but what about the rights of , you know , the rest of society , 
i mean , we're protecting this person's rights who has broken the law ,
and we protect him so much , 
but what about the rest of the society , 
you know , what are we doing for them , 
we're kind of , you know , forgetting about them 
and , i think sometimes that a criminal should kind of , 
if he breaks law , especially it he's a repeater , the law shouldn't just always cover for him ,
 well , and then in a lot of , 
in criminal cases , uh , for instance , you can't bring up prior convictions unless they are somehow directly related to the case . 
and it seems to me that a jury can make a much more rational decision if they know somebody had fifteen convictions for a similar crime , 
  now it's possible that he didn't commit the   
but  , the likelihood  certainly   tilts it  .
with a record like that . 
though , uh , one of the two people who gave the perjured testimony , had a long criminal record and had been , you know , a real sleaze bag . 
and he came in and was presented to the court as a   standing young man who had , uh , been in seminary to become a priest , 
but i happen to know his background 
and i know that he would have sold out his mother for , uh , uh , shorter sentence . 
and , you know , it's really annoying when the , 
i asked the defense attorney later why he didn't bring up all this other trouble the guy had been in . 
he said that was barred , uh , by the court . 
so , we do have some problems 
and it seems to me that , uh , maybe it's time to just scrap all the case law and go back to general principles .
but , uh , where you , 
i'd even go for trying to get some truth out of the witness stand if they come up with some pretty reliable , uh , um , lie detector tests that we can see right then and there whether they're lying or telling the truth . 
that would be  wrongful  .
yeah , you know . 
sure would . 
i witnessed one trial many years ago when i was first , um , studying to be a paralegal 
and , uh , uh , they barred priors on this , uh , person 
and they never then told us , i guess , because priors had a reason as to why these two people were very much in hatred of each other . 
and they never told us why these two people had such a vendetta against each other 
and the crime was , uh , uh , attempt to commit murder , you know , 
but they never told us why these people were mad at each other 
and you think that would be relevant . 
you know , because they told us in school that , you know , crime has to be an intent , you know , has to be not just the act but you have to intend to do it 
because there could be accidental kind of things , you know , 
but they never told us why these two people , hated themselves or if one had done something to , you know , really aggravate the other 
there was never any motive ,
and i had a tough time with that 
and being a person who saw what the jury didn't plus what the jury did , because we were just observing , you know , there in the courtroom ,
i still have a lot of reasonable doubts 
and i've seen everything presented 
and , you know , they just haven't a real complete case here to my thinking . 
i don't know that i want to , 
i think so , 
and i , 
and you'd still , you know , 
i want ask some questions here .
that's something i thought would be a very good idea of when juries come in they are told just to shut up and listen . 
and it seems to me that you'd get a lot more , uh , information if your questions were heard ,
but particularly the witnesses . 
allow them to , uh , go back and deliberate and , uh , you know , after each days proceedings come out with some questions that they want answered like the next day , bring those people back , 
or if they would allow them to , uh , give broader answers , they , 
it's really kind of , uh , choreographed . 
it's like a script has been written when people testify . 
they aren't testifying really in their own words , 
i can remember , uh , friends of daddy  . . . 
well , uh , what do you think about taxes , 
do you think we're paying too much ? 
yes and no . 
 uh , i look at it this way , uh , you've got to pay for the privilege of living here . 
but , uh , being uh , a rec vehicle owner , 
well , in fact , i live in a motor home . 
i'm what they call a full timer 
and , uh , it burns gas like crazy . 
i only get seven miles to the gallon . 
i really resent this fact that they keep adding on gasoline taxes 
and they call it , uh , uh , 
what's the word they use , 
anyway , a luxury tax . 
they on to tires and gasoline , cigarettes , liquor . 
it doesn't bother me any because i've quit drinking 
and i quit smoking . 
so , that doesn't bother me 
but i don't think it's fair . 
 um , um , it's attacking just certain people . 
how true . 
even with the gasoline tax . 
well , gasoline , especially , in this part of the country we all use it all the time , you know , 
 that's not what i would consider a luxury . 
uh , fifty years ago the automobile was a luxury 
but it's a necessity today 
and , uh , as hard as they try to get these public transit things going i have never seen nor heard of one that really got of the ground .
what are your feelings on it ? 
well , um , i think that we probably are paying a little too much tax considering what we're getting for it and how it's being managed and so forth . 
i mean , better system 
and we would get more for our money . 
it's totally out of our hands 
so we can't really do a whole lot about how that money is spent and where it goes 
and , uh , 
that's so true . 
i mean , they say well , you voice your opinion , uh , uh , uh , on election day . 
but not really . 
you don't . 
look what happened on the last presidential election , 
read my lips . 
and what happened they turned around and double crossed us . 
so , uh , i mean , you can't believe what you hear . 
well , i think too , 
one of the things that rubs me the wrong way the most is those programs that are funded by congress and , uh , that don't seem to have any validity at all . 
i mean , they're always far out 
and , uh , you know , they're studying some obscure bug , you know , 
uh , yes . 
and our tax money pays for those things 
and i think that's wrong . 
i agree 
i also think we extend too much help to other , uh , countries 
we need enough help here in this country . 
that's right . 
they're still people starving people here *[[they're there're
why should we help starving people somewhere else . 
and i think here lately they've been saying quite often and maybe somebody's coming to realize we're the nation in trouble . 
now i can't wait for , uh , 
what's going to happen here in the not to distant future . 
we keep hearing well , we're going to receive , uh , eight billion dollars from japan for the big ,
the war . 
 uh , so many billions of dollars here and there and everything 
and , uh , the next thing you know we'll be turning around just like we did to poland 
and i think that's a mistake . 
oh , definitely . 
somewhere , you know , we have to realize that we can't just keep giving it away . 
well , another thing now they keep decontrolling different things . 
first , it was the airlines then it was banks and , uh , um , savings association ,
we know what trouble they got into .
and the same with the airlines back in the days when they were , uh , controlled and , uh , transcontinental or , um , um , interstate , uh , trucking . 
i mean , as soon as the federal government gave up control on all that , they just went to hell in a hand basket . 
prices went sky high . 
then , in the case of airlines , of course , they became highly competitive 
and they cut each others throats until they reach the point where they're cutting their own throat . 
that's government controlled . 
but , uh , 
well , i think another thing too that , um , i've had a little contacted with , uh , 
well , i think they're very unfair in the amount of penalties and interest that they can attach to that because you will not only payback that that you wrote off 
but you will at least double that amount 
oh , by the time you get through with uh 
and to me there's something wrong there , you know . 
i mean , i can see paying the interest and some small penalty 
but they really stick it to you big time . 
uh , i agree . 
i think the i r s is , uh , just too powerful . 
there should be some sort of a control on it . 
and they should be a little more humane . 
uh , the , uh , typical bureaucratic , i guess . that's one of my pet peeves . 
i came up with a brilliant idea how we could reduce the budget . 
very simple . 
give , uh , uh , uh , government employees the average number of , uh , holidays as the , uh , 
i mean , you think about it now , 
they get about sixteen holidays a year . 
that's a lot . 
it sure is . 
and i think here at ti we get , what is it nine or ten ? 
well , i haven't counted . 
 i would have guessed eight even 
but you might be right . 
i don't have any idea . 
well , i remember , uh , uh , 
i think it was the last time i did hear that we get about the average . 
maybe even a little more , a day or so more than the average . 
but , uh , government is ridiculous . 
just think of the money they could save . 
i mean , they're paying out this money anyway . 
why not get the work out of the people . 
and , well , anyway that would , of course , eventually come back to taxes . 
but , uh , as far as income tax is concerned , i can't complain too much about it . 
uh , i'm single , 
i have no , uh , dependents or anything , 
my children are all grown 
and they're out worrying about their own income taxes . 
well , i have another thing that i thought about too , for instance , when you try to save money and you earn interest on whatever your investment is 
and , you know , we're not typically talking about big dollars 
but here you feel like you've done something good 
you've earned your interest 
and then you have to go back and pay taxes on it . 
so , the real amount of your savings on that is , not much . 
uh , very true . 
you know , it's kind of a vicious circle there . 
and then they tell you to , uh , well , invest it in , uh , is it i r a s or something 
and then , 
and the tax is a lot less . 
but in the mean time you've got your money tide up in a relatively low interest bearing investment . 
i mean , it's not making ten , fifteen percent like a business is today . 
uh , me i'm a firm believer in that if you got it spend it . 
well , you can come over to my house and spend it .
well , you , 
i wish i had some to spend . 
oh , uhhuh . 
well , that's problem too . 
i'm trying to figure out from one payday to the next whose going to be the lucky one this month that's going to get paid . 
that's the way it goes .
did you get a catalog or something from these people ? 
you did ? 
everybody i've talked to has received one 
but i haven't gotten mine . 
uh , i don't know . 
um , well , anyway ellen , it was nice talking to you . 
you too . 
and , uh , until next time . 
i think that maybe the automation people that are 
oh , okay . 
is he the one that got you connected with us ? 
it's a lot of fun . 
you ready ? 
well , are you going to buy a car soon ? 
well , it won't be too much longer because my husband and i are both going to retire . 
and when we retire we're going to buy us , and get rid of the two that we have right now . 
and what are you going to buy ? 
i don't know , 
we're either going to buy a pick up , 
or we're going to buy a van . 
or we're going to buy an economy car , 
how do you like that  ? 
well , have you been listening to  iacocca's  arguments that all have air bags ? 
uh , yeah . 
does that make a difference to you ? 
i really would like to have something like that , 
and i'm hoping that by you know , 
that's like , right now , 
my husband would like for me to buy another vehicle right now . 
like what ? 
well , just like that air bag . 
i think that thing is fantastic . 
because i've seen some of you know , like the head on collision type things ,
we had one here , 
i guess it was about three weeks ago , 
and the people walked away from the , wreck ,
that's   .
did you see the , uh , 
did that scare you a little bit ?
you got it . 
 i would not buy a car that had the seat belt where it was hooked under the door . 
that really sc , 
that a little more than scared me , 
that irritated me , uh , 
because that if the door came open the lady would fall out , 
i mean , and , 
well , you know what the average person , 
would you ever have thought of that ? 
i mean now i , 
probably , well , 
you probably wouldn't have , 
i might , 
the problem is i'm really into cars , 
and so it's not a , uh , 
for me it's a real consideration , uh , uh , 
 and , uh , the , 
but no 
 because you always think , 
i mean , i don't know , 
maybe you don't , 
but that's just like , 
i don't know if you've heard about it a few years ago , they said , you know , before they had like the shoulder strap thing where it was just like a seat belt that goes across your waist ? 
all these people were , 
it was on one of those kind of shows like twentytwenty 
these people were like paralyzed , 
 because , it threw them forward , 
but they were hooked at the waist , 
and so it like , you know , did something to their spinal cord 
then they were like paraplegics . 
you know , road and track had some articles on , 
and particularly were sitting in the back seat with seat belts on , 
and they were thrown forward , into the front seat , 
and there was enough stretching , the combination of stretching the spine to , uh , they were still locked in the 
they were forced to go , 
so really if your sitting in the back seat , your better off not to have your seat belt on , if it's just a seat belt . 
we have a van , that , uh , just has seat belts in the back doesn't have a shoulder harness 
well , tell me about your van . 
do you like it ? 
 i have an arrow star van , 
uh , it's a mini van , 
we've had it , 
goodness in may will be five years 
and , uh , they replace the engine at sixty thousand under extended warranty . 
and the transmission was replaced 
but they really are nifty , uh , 
the mini van , it's 
actually , we had a station wagon before , 
and it's a foot or two shorter than a , 
we had a regular size station wagon 
 and it really , uh , 
we like it , 
interestingly enough one of the features we like are the electric locks . 
huh . the reason that we're thinking about something like that , we took a trip in my brother in law and sister in laws to florida 
 and , like i said , i mean , we're not that old 
but my husband works for the state , 
and after a certain amount of years you can retire . 
and when he retires i'm retiring . 
well , as soon as i get my quarters in , i'm ,
that's it , 
you know , no more .
well , but , the , 
did you , 
as though 
and we wanted to travel , 
well , that was really nice traveling 
but you know , i like to i mean , hear about more people that have things like that you know ? 
and see what they think of them , 
the different kinds 
 because i've only ridden in the one , 
what kind was it ? 
uh , shoot 
i can't even think of the name of it now . 
what was remarkable , this van , even with , the , 
we have two kids , 
and we went to disney world 
 uh , actually i grew up in alabama , 
and i went to see my mother , 
and then went on down to disney world , 
and it got better than , i think twentytwo , twentythree miles a gallon . 
and this was with the air conditioner on and you know 
and , uh , course this , 
grant it , 
 you know , it's been four years ago , 
but it's remarkable that the bigger vans , uh , they're , uh , 
my boss just bought a pick up truck , 
and , uh , he only gets seventeen miles a gallon . 
but it has a big engine , 
and it , pulls a boat and stuff , 
it's got the seats 
 and the other thing that is interesting , is it has , uh , rear air conditioning . 
and that makes a lot of difference in those of us that live in warm climates . 
well , now , this one that we went in , 
it did 
baby what kind of van was that we went to florida in ? 
a what ? 
a ford ? 
ford what , 
you remember ? 
he was trying to think of what the name of it was , 
well , you know , the big vans are all ,
this was a big one . 
oh those are 
 and you know , it has the 
 and then it had the two swivels in the middle , and then the two swivel chairs on the front 
all right . 
 and , i mean it was fantastic , 
and it got good gas mileage , 
but i don't know 
i don't , 
i want something i can drive too , you know , 
and i was scared to drive that big van . 
you'd be surprised one of the , the mini vans , uh , 
  more or less alike the , uh , chevrolet 
and , uh , well of course , oldsmobile has got one , 
and chryslers got one , 
but they drive remarkably like cars . 
well , does yours have that this one had it where you know , you would see something coming in the rear view mirror , i mean not the rear , those little side mirror things 
 and it would look like it was further back than it was . 
but , the little , thing etched in it , 
say objects are closer than they appear or something .
does yours do that too ? 
oh . i was wondering if all vans did that , 
well you can , uh , install those mirrors , 
we've got the big side mirrors , which are really nice . 
i don't know well , if you've driven a pick up truck , you know , 
these , uh , mirrors must be six inches across not nearly a foot high , 
and they're really nice , uh , 
got them on both sides , 
actually they fold , so when you get in tight situations , you can fold them back . 
but they're 
well , see that's the reason we couldn't really make them , 
at first we were going to get a pick up truck , with a camper on the back of it , 
but then that gas mileage was just atrocious , 
i mean it's ,
it just practically don't get any . 
well , they have got , some of the newer ones you know , with the aerodynamic features , 
you can get pretty decent gas mileage . 
and then , uh , he talked about a van , 
and another thing was 
that's the reason i said you know , there was such a big difference you know , in a little economy car , 
but really and truly the safety features 
but i wouldn't get one that , 
if it had , the seat belts on the door now 
  ford now announced i think in ninetytwo , they're going to put , uh , air bags in their vans . 
oh that would be good . 
i believe safety , 
i really do believe in this stuff , uh , 
and i think it can go ,    , 
i'm not , 
the air bags are a good deal 
but , uh , surprisingly , uh , they're , uh , 
you really need to do , 
you need a combination of both the air bags uh , 
oh i think so too , 
i don't think they should do away with the seat belts now . 
but i think you need the shoulder thing 
i think you need the thing around your waist , 
but , i think you need that bag to pop out too . 
you know , because i know so many people , here that have been killed in head on collisions , where maybe if they that 
but , uh , i think it's fantastic . 
i wish they required it in everything . 
every new car that came out , i wish they would require it in it . 
it would be   that would do to our insurance rates , you know , if the car doesn't have , uh , air bags . 
uh , that wouldn't be fair 
but , uh , 
well , no because what they would do is , that's what they're going to plan on , you know , 
they would have to do it , 
the insurance company would have to do the same thing . 
they're given like , a ten year time limit 
these cars , i guess they figure all the old cars , will be off the roads or something in ten years 
 and then , you know , if you didn't have a car that had one , then your insurance would go up enormously , 
uh , i've got to go 
my son's in a performance tonight , 
i have to leave ,
oh that's okay , 
uh , i think we've probably spent a reasonable amount of time . 
it was good talking to you , 
well , you too . 
good night . 
all right 
bye bye . 
dee , are you familiar with the latin american policies ? 
it's not my best subject . 
it's not mine either , 
but , uh , i know our policy , 
like in nicaragua , i am familiar with that because we have , uh , some friends that live on the nicaraguan border 
and they are missionaries there 
and they live there 
and they have to travel by boat fortyfive minutes to get to their car and stuff , 
and uh , i know that they helped a lot of those sandanistas refugees coming across the border 
and they housed them and stuff . 
they have been down there about three years now , 
and they wrote that it's kind of weird  , 
they have bats in their roof , 
but the bats eat the bad spiders 
so they leave the bats , you know . 
it's a whole different culture 
 they take it for granted 
and it's like we go down there on vacation , 
i think their policy with them that though , is , uh , 
i don't know , 
i think , 
i wish we would have just , 
i'm not that up on the policy of ways . 
i know that's kind of old , 
but i don't know , 
i'm glad that the sandanistas aren't in power anymore because i think that they were very wicked . and , uh , probably some of the biggest drug dealers that the world has probably ever seen , 
and i feel like most of the leaders in latin america are probably , 
you would be safe to say that they were just very very , you know , big into drugs . 
very very corrupt , like the panamanians were very corrupt . 
the thing about it though is the panamanians is , a lot of servicemen down there . 
a lot of american servicemen are involved , 
because i guess there was a that all these guys up . 
thousands of servicemen ,
so , it's like everybody is into it , 
it's just greed .
interestingly   in honduras ,
and i , 
my girlfriend used to , uh , be in the navy 
and she was uh , based in panama . 
in honduras , very , uh , uh , proamerican . 
and there's a lot of men , i don't know how many american , uh , 
soldiers are there , 
but there's a lot . 
i mean , they , uh , 
and the american government you can't trust them either , because you think , you don't know how corrupt they are . i mean they keep people in power like the shah of iran and ,
i mean , it's the lesser of two evils , 
they will probably say this is the lesser of two evils . 
but i don't know how corrupt the honduran government is . 
but the , 
they need to have more checks and balances in their government to get rid of the corruption . but i think first though , 
i don't know , 
 just in the drug crimes , 
because i feel like a lot of the leadership in those nations are so engrossed in the drug crimes that until they repent or they are moved from power , that you know , 
because there are so many of them that the next one to come up , if you just knock one off and then have another one , 
and i know a lot of those nations , there's , uh , brazil , i know , is like forty percent evangelical christian . not just go to church but , you know , really on fire for god , 
and they are just surpassing latin america by the drugs . 
you know , it's just incomprehensible , 
 i think that god is going to honor that and that he is going to put in some good leadership , 
and i know , the president of , i believe costa rica is a christian . 
and no guatemala , because he goes to virgo church in guatemala city . 
the church is in real close relationship with him . 
and he is a former president of guatemala . 
he's an elder at virgo church 
and , you know that god is doing something 
and he is raising up some leaders 
 and the people want him back as president bad , 
but they have a rule in guatemala that he can't have another term 
and so the people are trying to override that , i mean not just the christians , but all the people because they see when a righteous man is in authority , the people rejoice . 
see , that's the thing , 
it's going , have to , 
that's the undoing of everything , 
and it's the , 
we have no morals , when we , talk about the crime and all that in the city , 
it's just the kids have no morals . 
that's the thing that will eventually , you know , 
if anyone is going to be saved . 
it is having a good moral background . 
and it's funny you mention costa rica , because they are one of the most successful and peaceful countries ,
so , i was reading an article in the , uh , national geographic 
and , i don't know , 
i don't think they have any more money than any of the other countries , 
they don't have oil or anything , 
and they don't have big tourism . 
so maybe it is their faith that enables them to keep the crime out . 
i know that costa rica , they don't allow anybody what do you call immigrants ? 
they don't allow anything like that 
like i could not go to costa rica and live as an american citizen . 
they would not permit me to live there to work . 
they wouldn't . 
their jobs are there for costa ricans . 
they don't allow people to move in , like less nations , you know , 
they don't probably take a lot of refugees from other countries either . 
take the job . 
i mean i couldn't even go there . 
my husband had to receive all this special permission to go , 
so even with , uh , you know , in , uh , inner company , you know , transfer , or something , 
and i have another friend in , uh , costa rica that , 
she was born there . 
she's costa rican . 
i guess i do know a little bit . 
i went to mexico city one time and stayed . 
i have been there twice and stayed 
and , aw , that was just really sad . 
but , a lot of it though is their debt . 
i think that we should not loan them anymore money , 
that if we still want to give them money , give them money , quit loaning it to them . 
you're not going to get it back . 
don't be indebted to anybody . 
don't be the loaner or borrower . 
it's just not good . 
if we feel like we need to give them money then give it to them , 
but quit loaning all the money out . 
which i don't think we are loaning anymore now , 
but that's how we got into a problem . 
if we got , the , 
we went in the hole by us loaning them all of these billions of dollars . 
that's common sense , 
you could just look at it and say they're not going to be able to pay us back . 
also , uh , uh , mexico , uh , we will loan the money in uh , 
a lot of the higher people ,
so we're suckers . 
 it's like we are partly responsible for their problems by loaning them all that money , 
that was really stupid on our part to even loan it to them . 
you don't loan money to people like that . 
i mean if you feel like you need to give them something to help them out , fine , 
but you don't go making billions of dollars of loans in , to people that you can just look at the situation , 
they know they're not going to pay it back . 
and know that they are going to be capable of paying us back , 
and that puts a bondage on them . 
it makes , you know , pressure on the nation , and on the people , and on the leadership , and makes their inflation go up , 
and it's just a big mess . 
did you go to mexico city , uh , anywhere near when the earthquake hit . 
i was there before that , 
but i knew people , 
i got a letter from a friend of mine that i had met there , who the apartment building was destroyed 
and they were living in a tent , 
so it's kind of weird , you know . 
to these people who were on u s dive , the mexican diving , we went to the pool together , and watched them dive and all this , 
so they were you know , just normal people , weren't squatters or poor people or anything that , uh , 
i knew all of my friends there , 
but none of them that i know of , got killed in it . 
but , uh , they're all christians though . 
god really protected them . 
see that broke out a revival in mexico city . that c b s news and a b c never told you about . 
there's been a real revival in mexico city since that earthquake , because a whole lot of witchcraft . 
oh , i can imagine . 
oh , really . 
oh , yeah . 
they call themselves christians , 
but you know they are over there doing witchcraft and stuff , and just a whole lot of the generational things too , like the mayans and the incas . 
you can't find a trace of them because god totally destroyed them for how wicked they were . 
and yet , they are revered and honored and almost worshiped by 
so many people , 
even now in america , you know , we wouldn't know the truth with all of indian groups that were totally removed from the face of the earth , because of how wicked they were . 
i've been down to the pyramids 
and i have climbed to the top of the pyramid where they used to take a beating heart out of a young thirteen year old boy , 
and they hold it up to the sun god , 
and that's pretty of heavy duty . 
is there still blood stains on the altar 
or has it worn away through the years ? 
the little box is black on the top of the pyramid in the sun . 
it's black , 
you can't really tell , 
but it was kind of weird , you know , 
do you get spooked , you feel , 
or do you get butterflies in your stomach when you go there ? 
it really impressed me , just you know , feeling 
but i wasn't a christian when i went there , 
but , uh , i think that a lot of those you know , generational things 
i think , that god sees i'm praying , you know , 
that keeps the christians that are beginning to rise up there to be able to pray , because that does affect that things , you know , in your background . 
hi , maureen . 
how are you ? 
all right . 
well do you have a family budget ? 
but we haven't . 
so why don't you explain to me some good tips about what you've done , which you've found useful and workable . 
we do a few things , 
and i have to say my husband and i are both from financial backgrounds . 
i'm an accountant . 
and , uh , he has an m b a , 
so , uh , we were sort of , you know , keyed in on expenses and things like that . 
um , okay . 
um , coming from that background , what we pretty much do is in our household , as far as living expenses , we live on a cash budget . 
every month , my husband , uh , goes to the credit union and withdraws , you know , x amount of dollars for the month , 
and then that money is used during that month . 
we have a certain budget . 
 excuse me . for instance , i control all the household expenses , the groceries , uh , the haircuts , the gasoline for my car , any miscellaneous expenses , babysitting , things like that . 
and , uh , .
but , uh , we've gotten pretty good at it , 
we've been doing it a couple of years now . 
so , our budgets are realistic 
and they are not so stringent you know to make us feel uncomfortable . 
and my dollars here and there , shopping , uh , at warehouses sometimes , like at sam's and things like that . 
but , uh , on a cash budget 
and sometimes it's tight come the end of the month , 
but generally , we always make it . 
what do you do for the surprise things that you don't necessarily plan for , 
the , you know are sometimes several hundred dollars , like , uh , tires for the car or car repair of some sort ,
well , uh , most of our medical things , we don't , uh , have to worry about , because of insurance 
and they're relatively small . 
uh , we've been lucky . 
in the past we didn't have that problem 
but right now we don't . 
for the other things , the things that crop up , that we aren't really expecting , we have different funds set aside for different things . 
like we have a car fund 
and we put a certain amount of money into that every single month whether we need to or not . 
so , i mean , 
and i can't really remember what it is . 
do you kind of continue , call this like , a part of savings account or a different savings account 
it's all part of the savings account . 
we just keep track of it on paper . 
uh , you know a certain amount goes straight to the savings account . 
we decide , okay , you know , let's say it's a hundred dollars . 
you know , every month fifteen dollars is for car fund . you know , 
ten dollars is for vacation fund whatever . 
uh , and we constantly do that , so that there's a buildup of money for those things if something does come up . 
like i know that my washing machine is going to go any day . 
oh , okay . 
 but , we have the money set aside , 
so if it does it's not going to kill us . 
uh , so we're pretty disciplined , 
so it makes those surprises not so difficult to get through . 
then , so like your pay , what kind of a percentage do you basically keep out that you think that , you know , will cover all of the expenses , kind of thing ? 
well , in . 
or like what percent , do you then save or something ? 
uh , we have a lot of different things . 
right now , we save about twentyfive percent of our pay . 
hm , okay . 
 and it goes toward different things , 
it's you know , for vacations like i said , for , you know , emergencies like for car , uh , breaks down , something like that . 
uh , and we also put money aside for our kids college . 
neither of us had any help with our college degrees , 
and just this last month we paid off my final school loan . 
we're starting our kids a little bit early . 
do you , uh , use a lot of credit cards or your checking account when you go out and buy things ? 
checking account a lot , uh , not so much credit cards . 
and so pretty much now , uh , we don't use them too much . 
if we travel or something , yeah . but , you know . 
or if it is a purchase , uh , then it's paid off when the bill comes . 
you know , so it isn't any extended , uh , 
it may be that i picked up something at the store , 
but then when the bill comes we always pay it off then , 
so it's not any , you know , uh , build up on the charge cards at all . 
that's good . 
but that hasn't always been the case .
so , i'm kind of , 
i feel at least better now that i have finally gotten some of those things , uh , you know , in the past , 
and i don't have , you know , big cumulative amounts due to those charge cards , because that interest rate just is a killer . 
oh , and it's not deductible anymore . 
well , i've never been in the situation of itemizing anyhow . 
but , uh , pretty much when i go to the grocery store or something i just always write checks . 
we did that for a long time 
and it got to the point where we had no idea how much we were spending on things . 
and it seemed like we didn't have enough money when things cropped up , you know , 
so we decided to put ourselves on a cash budget . 
well the first time we did it , we just took some arbitrary amount that we estimated it would be , 
and then we kept track of everything for a month .
so now , i mean , i have , 
i don't remember what it is now , four hundred dollars for the month , let's say . 
and , uh , i mean some months i may spend three hundred on groceries and a hundred on everything else , 
and some months it may be different . 
it's not as though we feel like we have to keep ourselves , you know , down to the dollar or the penny in certain categories kind of thing , 
but the way we set up , you know the amount that we want to save and the amounts that we have to spend for , you know , uh , utilities and , uh , the house payment and all that . 
those are things you don't really have much control over . 
uh , the cash budget just fits right in there  , 
like i said if we don't have , we also set aside money for entertainment . 
i mean , but again it's a set amount every month .
we still have fun on things .
uh , we are in the process of trying to buy a house , 
do you know , how did your budget work 
or did you have a budget to , uh , get your down payment going to get a house ? 
well , no 
and the kind of loan we got , you really didn't have to put down anything . 
so , we got into it fairly cheaply , 
and then , uh , after we sold the first house , we were left with enough cash that there was enough to make the down payment on this house . 
oh , okay . 
so , we got out of that one pretty easily .
okay , uh , 
i just keep thinking all the time 
i mean , you know , your priority , at least mine is to save for the house . 
but then it's awful hard to really scrimp for a long , long time and keep putting all the money into that down payment . 
you feel like you want to live a little bit in the meantime . 
i know . 
that's how i feel sometimes about my kids' education , 
i mean jeez , they are one and four .
we have got a long time to save , 
my husband , he's the real disciplinarian when it comes to that money usually . 
oh , no , 
well , i know , 
but there are times when i sit there and i think , wow , you know we make x amount of money and where is it . 
i mean you look around 
what do you do with it , 
i know . 
you haven't made , uh , big purchases 
and that's the easier thing to see , 
but , all those , just monthly payments and stuff that just go out the door 
and there's big chunks of your money to pay like the utilities and the gas and the groceries ,
that you don't have used and gone . 
it's amazing how much we spend on some things . 
my husband cut himself down to ten dollars a week for his lunch at work . 
and that's all he has , 
he has a ten dollar bill . 
 i mean , so i'd say at least , two usually three times a week he takes his lunch . 
the other times , he'll , uh , i don't know go out somewhere ,
 but he keeps himself on that , 
i mean , he found it's so easy to spend five dollars a day on lunch . 
that's a hundred dollars a month on lunch . 
that's twelve hundred dollars a year just on lunch . 
when he can take a sandwich , you know . 
well , how about you , are you an exercise fanatic ? 
me either .
i'm definitely  , 
i do like to walk . 
do you ? 
since t i has , uh , uh , instituted that , um , walkabout ,
it was so funny the other day , 
i took some guys to , to lunch 
 that's the way to do it . 
i'm kind of like you , 
i've never really gotten into it , 
it's just a chore , you know , 
um , um . 
and i finally decided one semester , i'm in college and i'm taking night classes and i still don't have any of my p e classes , 
and that will get me where i'll have to do it , you know , 
and they were offering a walking class ,
um , um . 
and then you have to go in once a week and log your points 
so it's not like you can do the class like anytime you want , you know , 
and , at the end of the semester you go back in and like your final exam is a three mile walk . 
and if you walk it in this many minutes , you get an a , 
this many minutes you get a b , 
and , i thought , oh , this will be an easy class . 
 and i did it for a long time 
like about the middle of the semester i ended up having to have surgery on my foot , 
oh , no . 
and this has been a couple of years ago , 
and , you know , i did that , 
and i just ended up having to drop the class . 
you know , by the time the final came around , i wasn't even where i could wear a shoe yet ,
oh , no . 
but , that was the only time i have ever been able to like start an exercise program and really stick to it ,
um , um . 
and , my teacher looked at it every week , you know . 
but , other than that you know , i kind of get in the mood every once in awhile , say ,
well , you know , i have noticed too that , uh , when i started uh , not the exercise but the walking program , uh , that i did tone up , you know , like all over , 
but it didn't get the upper part of my body , 
uh , so , what i do , is i bowl . 
i am a fanatic when it comes to bowling , 
and i used to bowl five times a week , 
so , i really loved it , 
and i still bowl at least once a week now , on a league , on a , 
and i'm bowling on the t i league . 
um , but i've noticed that what i do is that i have my towel that sits on the floor , so that every time i get up to bowl , i have to bend over to pick up my towel 
and that way i get the little extra exercise . 
i'm always explaining to people , i do little things like that , like , you know , take the stairs instead of um , the elevator , 
and , i do silly things like that versus a regular program that you would have . 
but that's , 
you're amazed at how much that adds up . 
it sure does . 
i was on , uh , nutri systems for a while , 
and , that is one of the things that they really stressed doing , you know , 
when you come to your nutri system meeting , don't park in the parking place outside the front door ,
i mean , and they stressed things like that too . 
you know , when you're sitting watching t v at night ,
there you go . 
and , you'd be surprised at how much just that little bit adds up ,
that's true . 
especially when you're like us and don't really want to do it anyway . 
i used to , 
i really did , uh , years ago 
and , uh , i was thinking about that not too long ago that i used to walk 
and not only did i walk 
but , i used to watch all those exercise programs on t v , 
and i would tape them , 
and then i would do them like two times a day , 
but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore . 
i think having children everything just kind of , everything goes by the wayside . 
well , i can't use that as an excuse because i didn't do it before 
i had mine either . 
i've never been , 
 i'm more into , you know , sitting , than i am  , 
me too . 
but , you know , i have found that with , 
i have a two year old , 
and we'll walk up and down the street , 
and we'll go to the park 
and i'll run around with him and stuff like that , 
so i'm getting you know , more exercise that way than i ever did before i had him , you know . 
um , um . um , um . 
so , i think that has helped a little bit , 
i don't know . 
just chasing him around the house , you know , 
that's enough . 
well , mine are older now , doing , uh , their own things 
you've kind of gotten out of that little stage there . 
oh , yes . 
i have a thirteen year old and an eleven year old , 
oh , lucky you , 
you're getting into even more interesting stages . 
we're actually going through the same stages the two year old and the teenager .
you watch it'll be exactly the same .
same thing , huh , the terrible twos repeat at about thirteen .
 it does , 
it absolutely does , 
how interesting , i can hardly wait .
 i just know you can't . 
but , no , 
i don't get as much exercise as i used to 
but , at least , since t i has implemented that program , i do , 
i'm more aware of it , 
and , you know , that i'm need to do this , that and the other 
 uh , so , i try to do combinations of things but not , like go down to the president's health club , like i see all these people do . 
that walkabout's a good program . 
it is , 
it really is , you know , 
when they first started it , i got all the information , of course , 
but just like everything else , i was real gung ho with a friend of mine , 
"oh , we're going to do this , we're going to do this ," 
and we did do it for a long time , 
and then i started school , you know , 
um , um . 
and like two nights a week i was going to school 
and then the other two nights a week my husband worked , 
so i had to pick ryan up , you know , 
oh , yeah . 
there's always an excuse , you know , 
oh , yeah . 
and , it gets worse , 
it doesn't get any better . 
oh , i'm sure , 
because i'm constantly running my children around someplace 
and that's where i actually get my exercise ,
here to here , 
to the mall , to the movies , to the friends , to the , 
there you go , 
that's it , 
sounds like fun . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
well , it was really good to talk to you . 
well okay , 
we'll talk to you later . 
take care , 
talk to you later . 
um , um . 
so , do you fish ? 
oh , yeah . 
and so we go there for the small lake , uh , just outside of the dallas fort worth area . 
it takes us about three hours to get there . 
and we go , and we fish , 
and we catch a bunch of junk . othing to talk about for the most part , 
but it's fun . 
from the dock , from shore . 
oh , that's nice . 
uh , mostly catfish 
oh , mostly we catch carp . 
if we're doing good , we catch a catfish or two once in a while . 
and , you know , we go ahead and eat those . 
but we've never caught enough to really have what you'd call a fish fry . 
what we normally do is just , uh , go ahead and clean it up , and then , uh , you know , put it in a bag and freeze it . 
and somebody takes it home and eats it then when there's just a couple people instead of a whole crowd . 
usually , there's a pretty good crowd there , 
so we don't ever catch enough to eat . 
carp is usually pretty much fun . 
because i've caught up to about an eight pound carp on you know , a little pole with twenty pound test line . 
and that's a pretty good fight . 
so that's a lot of fun . 
a real light line , real light rig ? 
well , that sounds like fun . 
they fight hard . 
fish in colorado different than that . 
mostly trout in the mountains . 
and in the rivers and stuff ? 
are they good to eat ? 
uh , yeah , 
oh , you mean size wise they're not very big ? 
um , by and large , no . 
well , i've been , 
is that mostly , uh , fly fishing when you're doing that 
or are you using a bobber ? 
i'm a fly fisherman . 
i cast a ways . 
i'm not highly proficient , 
but it's fun . 
i've never even tried that . 
if i don't have a reel with a button on it , i tend to get so much backlash , it's not worth the trouble .
you're not casting a weight on the end of the line ? 
with the little thing on the end . 
i thought it had a weight . 
it weighs less than the line . 
so what you do is , you strip off , oh , four , five , six little rolls , coils , of line into your hand . 
 and you whip the line . 
as you whip it , over your head ,
um . so you're fishing downstream so it will carry some ? 
well , no , 
and then you let it carry it downstream . 
and then you reel it in , 
and you do it again . 
you hope that they think it's a bug and , 
jump at it . 
uh , from what i'm seeing and hearing and all , the big pattern that's really looking forward for spring is the grub pattern . 
that's a fish ? 
oh , it's a lure . 
whenever you , yeah , 
a lure , a fly . 
i see . 
whenever you have something that looks like something else 
 and it's a fly , you call it a pattern . 
all right , uh , you know , 
did someone just come up with this design , 
and you're going to make one for yourself , 
 or are you going to buy it ? 
you can buy them . 
uh , i've got some . 
oh , it's just , that , that just happens to be what the fish like this year , 
you know how that changes , the phase of the moon 
we tend to use just bait .
but bait tends to work the best , just some blood bait . 
oh , are you ? 
where are you from ? 
oh , i'm from midland . 
oh , another west texan . 
i went to college at tech , 
so . you've been out to buffalo gap fishing . 
i've been up there . 
i didn't catch anything , 
but i've been up there .
it's fun . 
it's lazy . 
take a picnic lunch . 
i used to do that with my dad . 
every once in a while we'd go out on a saturday and just spend the day .
well , there you fish mornings and evenings .
we do most of our fishing at night . 
just from the heat of it all . 
that's one advantage you've certainly got on us . 
it , at times , gets incredibly hot here . 
it does ? 
i've only been up there once . 
in the summer . well , 
i've been up there twice in the summer . 
but both times it was really pleasant . 
in fact , it snowed on us in , gosh , when was that ? 
we were in mesa verde park , 
and it was just before july fourth . 
and it was twentyeight , twentynine degrees . 
we were out in this silly tent with regular little sleeping bags , not knowing any better .
and here it went and it froze , 
and it snowed on us . 
we did not know what to do about it . 
fishing is not just dragging fish out of the water . 
it's a total experience , you know , getting out in nature and ,
do you have to , 
do you wear waders when you fish ? 
i just freeze . 
goodness , it must be a little bit cold . 
well , you know , 
that's cold water around there . 
um . do you have any , 
you know , i always intend to just stand on the bank and just kind of slip it ,
 oh , i see . 
and you know how it is . 
the water's kind of , 
and you get a little more carried away with it , 
and you move a little closer . 
and then you're in to it just a little bit , 
and then you splash in 
 do you have any kids that you take fishing ? 
she's real sweet . 
and , uh , at times she enjoys it , at times not . 
a fuzzy little dog . 
 i have a three and a half year old and a one and a half year old . 
and the little one , of course , could care less . 
the , uh , three and a half year old has just gotten to the point , 
we got him a little pole last year , 
and uh , his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up .
that was what he considered fishing .
this year , he's gotten to where he can . 
we were at a friend's , uh , stock pond , we were out at their farm , 
we all walked off a healthy hundred yards or so and let him fish . 
and he started trying to cast it . 
so , he was kind of getting there 
but he's , 
you guys sure want to be out of range . 
he understands the mechanics of pushing the button and throw , but not necessarily the direction it's going to go in . 
it takes time . 
last year , we had oh , just a wonderful trip up to travers lake . *[trapper's lake in colorado ? 
oh , it was cold , and rain the whole time . 
and we still had a good time out ,
well , that's good . 
uh , and colorado is a beautiful place to live . 
oh , yeah . 
my husband would like to live there , 
but i don't know . all of our family is here 
well , and you've got to have , 
you've got to work for a living . 
well , yeah , 
but t i is up there , 
what division you all in ? 
i'm sorry , what ? 
we're both , uh , 
i was , uh , military , 
but he's division three . 
it goes back and forth . 
division , well , 
maybe division one right now . 
he's in computers . 
 well , the only thing up here , 
 and he's in school , 
i have some friends who work up there . 
oh , yeah ? 
kathy and kevin guy . 
and they like to fish . 
they've been inviting us to come up there in the summer . 
her dad has a cabin , 
and they go fishing , up there . 
oh , fishing's , 
 so that would be neat to , 
it's not , 
it seems like the success rate here is not as good as on some of the better lakes there . 
but it is fun . 
 you know , 
long as you have a good time , that's the main point 
you know , it seems more relaxing , there's more to look at . 
and there's something about listening to water run that's relaxing to the soul .
the only thing you've got to watch is when that creek comes up . 
we camped next to one , one time when we were there a couple of summers ago . 
and we figured we were up a long way off . 
and then it rained that night , 
and we got up the next day , 
and that creek that had been fifty or sixty feet from our site of our tent was now about three feet away .
so , that was kind of funny . 
it is interesting to watch that water rise all of a sudden . 
i just love the way it looks . 
i could almost just watch the wa , 
on trips before and just stopped and watched it because there was so much , 
and if you were there . i mean , 
it was , 
one time we were there , 
and i guess it was late may , 
so it was really your spring almost ,
i guess the creek , the mountains were really starting to melt , 
and the creek was just wild , just running . 
and all the white water and noise and the , 
it was just beautiful . 
it gets foamy almost . 
and you know it's just pure and pristine .
i have two children 
and they're older now , 
but , um , i found it very difficult to find good child care when i was looking for a place to for stay while i thought school , 
 and , um , i wanted when they were babies say till they were about two years old i preferred that they had an individual take care of them in a home 
and that's what i looked for 
and i was lucky enough to find one right across from my school , 
and that worked . 
well , that's good . 
that worked out real well 
but when they got older i wanted them to be in a school type situation , i think they were both three when they started where they could learn to interact with kids and , 
but i had , 
i have switched schools several times because i really didn't care for what was going on at that the school . 
i wanted them to learn to play i didn't academics forced on them at an early age . 
i , um , 
that , that's , 
oh , oh , you mean you switched schools for the kids . 
for the kids . 
well , i'm just recently married . 
so i don't have any children .
but i think , um , that that's probably one of the biggest difficulties , uh , 
i think , um , i'm lucky though that , um , my wife will probably not have to work while our children ,
  i'm a college professor , 
and that's also , 
and it's nice for me because , um , most of the time you have so much flexible hours so that i could probably work two or three days a week ,
oh that's , wonderful . 
so it will probably workout real nice for us , uh , 
i think we're very lucky because just my job sort of builds in flexible schedules , 
that's wonderful . 
i can even teach on saturdays and , 
um , i do know that my brother and his wife have a terrible time finding , uh , child care , 
 and one of the things they made in , um , uh , 
they're number one priority was that , um , they're children didn't have to leave their home  . *[[transcript errorspelling of initial "they're" should be "their"
oh , that's ,
my sisterinlaw is uh , um , a clinical speech pathologist , 
 so , she is als , 
i guess her most recent position after she returned back to work , she applied for a director's position and got it . 
so , i guess she's very well qualified for her field i guess 
and even though she took off two years for , um , 
i guess four years all together , 
it would be three years , 
how old's  kayla  
three , yeah , 
i guess she took off three years all together , um , cause i guess they have a four year old , 
almost two , 
so i guess she took off three all together 
and then when she decided to go back to work , um , she was able to find good position and pay for somebody to come into their home . 
oh , that's wonderful . 
i think they were really lucky there , 
but i think they've lost this woman she will not continue . 
oh , dear . 
and she won't do it in the summer because her kids are home from school . 
 so i don't know what they are going to do . 
oh , you know that's an ideal situation , 
 but not many people can afford ,
 so she was probably twentyseven when they were married , 
 so she already had gotten bachelors and masters and established herself in a ,
so by that time she was so well established , you know , 
 but , uh , i think the longer you wait the easier it is ,
 oh , i do to . 
oh , yeah , 
 but they're are just so many people out there that aren't that , uh , 
that's right , 
that's true , yeah . 
 uh , because i'm a single parent , 
 and i , uh , you know , my exhusband and i got a divorce , um , when the children were small 
and so i , uh , was a teacher 
i , uh , still am teacher , 
 and it was really difficult to find affordable child care that was what i wanted ,
and i knew my kids were being taken ,
and , uh , plus i , uh , wanted them to get something out of it ,
i guess when they're five , 
 and sometimes they flunk kindergarten now . 
they don't let them into kindergarten unless they can count to ten and know their a b c s 
and i think that's so funny because , um ,  , i don't know if i want 
 and i , 
it's a very important part of your life 
and i hope to read with my kids , 
but i don't know if i want my kids to go to school . at four ,
i agree with that . 
 you know , i can see that when you make that point . 
well , the thing is ,
and they're the ones that are having problems not only getting along with the other kids but academically ,
 and so i want my 
i wanted my children 
and they did learn to get along with other people . 
that's a really important point . 
and i mean i feel a lot of maladjusted adults 
and i bet if we trace back to their ,
i think that's important 
i've seen the same thing 
i think you're exactly right because , you know , i've gone ou , 
before i was married i went out with a girl ,  , 
and you know ,  , um , boy , you know , after about two months i realize this girl really has some deep set emotional problems . 
and i bet , 
and they could be traced back to just uh , you know , being moved between day care centers when she was one and two and three years old ,
i bet you could trace all the way back .
i bet you could too ,
 and if they don't they just don't turn out to be really , you know , good adults or ,
that's true , 
 you know , really 
but , uh , it is a big problem 
and you kno , i have lot of friends right now that , uh , have young children 
and they daily have problems with whoever is taking care of the child , 
 or they switch a lot , which is not good for the child either . 
that's true . 
so you need , 
cause you need that consistency when they're young like that , 
and it would be ideal like you hope when you have children ,
i would have given anything if i would have been able ,
i'm very lucky . 
um , because of having , you know , flexible higher education provides a flexible schedule . 
i teach a computer classes 
 oh , great . 
and i'm also , um , you know , 
they have vocational type courses on weekends ,
 and , you know , you can take you can teach two three hours classes on a saturday ,
 oh , that's , 
so that lets you be available three days during the week ,
 oh , great . 
 so you be will home with your kids you know 
it's really funny  , i picked this career when i was in college because , uh , i think with my commitment to family and , um , 
so , by the time he got home he was so tired 
and he was all rung out from the day , 
 and i think he missed a lot of , um , our up bringing . 
you know , my mother 
that my mother stayed home until we started school . 
um , and i don't , uh , 
it's probably costing you a fortune . 
oh it is , 
they really are expensive , 
my goodness , if you want them to be able to drive the car , the insurance bill . 
th , um , 
well , and they 
most of the area where we live in most of the kids have cars . 
so , you know , right now i'm looking for a little truck for my for my son , 
 so that you know an older ,  , truck 
so i can afford it , 
 but , you know , i just look forward to him helping me out because   i for years just car ,
carpools , uh , 
my parents did a lot of that . 
that's right . 
and just to save you trips to and from ,
that's right . 
isn't that something how , you know , you think about child care 
and it lasts along time . *[[along a long
it , does for ever . 
and then when you get through with your own you've got grandchildren , 
i see . 
are you from the , 
where are you from ? 
this is baltimore , maryland . 
oh , my gosh , i'm from , uh , plano , texas which is outside of dallas . 
because that's where t i is .
that makes sense . 
uh , well , i guess you know it's , you know , 
since living in dallas it's always so hot , because i don't work during the day . 
so , do you work ? 
uh , and , 
but i work at a manufacturing plant , 
so i wear a lot of blue jeans ,
but occasionally i have to get dressed up and wear panty hose and a dress ,
and i feel really uncomfortable doing that 
but , normally i just wear blue jeans and a tshirt . 
very , very , comfortable . 
i like that so much better than having to wear dress clothes . 
and buying suits and stuff , yeah , because just being at home 
and , i work at home , 
i don't go out and spend lots of money on , uh , different , you know , suits and stuff , you know . 
but when i , 
before i got married , you know , i was working 
so uh , you know , i had more suits and stuff then 
worry about all that kind of stuff .
 well , i have plenty of suits and dress clothes because i'm like you , when i first started working ,
 but now that i , you know , work in the manufacturing plant , then it's just , to actually get dressed up to come in to work like that . 
uh , but occasionally i have to because , uh , part of my job is teaching ,
and , uh , so you have to look just a little bit nicer than your normal ,
when you're training , right . 
but i'm like you , too , uh , i moved from ohio down to here 
moved from ,
 and i had mostly polyesters and ,
and then , of course , you have to iron them all the time . 
that's really , 
that's been a problem for me . 
because i came from wyoming 
and i had wool suits and wool skirts 
and , uh , the seasons are just so much different . 
you have so much summer . 
and , uh , so then when you know , i finally get a chance to go out with my husband it's like a real chore to find something nice to wear .
 that's true , that's true . 
well , i know , i was just now , uh , uh , putting away a lot of my winter clothes , 
 and i was going through here 
and i was thinking , i haven't worn this in three years . 
and , because it's a wool skirt 
and there's just not that many opportunities to wear it . 
and i have five or six wool skirts , 
 so i was thinking well , maybe , you know , i need to think about getting rid of them , 
you hate to get rid of it , because you know how much you spent on them . 
and it's real hard to get rid of some of that stuff , i know . 
well , i know last year , uh , well , this past winter , it wasn't that cold . 
but the previous winter we had more , uh , cold weather where i was able to actually wear ,
clothes , 
so  ,
and i just don't spend , you know , 
right now my clothes come from target , you know .
and they're all one hundred percent cotton 
and  , 
and they , 
you take them out of the drier 
and they're wadded up in a ball . 
i know . 
oh  , 
i'm so glad to meet somebody that their iron board is their permanent fixture in their house . 
it is , it is . 
you know , i have very little furniture , 
 but my ironing board is part of my decor 
 that's true , 
the door . 
and , uh , 
and then you can actually have one where you can put it inside of a wall , you know , to have it ,
and that's what i'm thinking i'm going to have to do because mine's sitting right out in front of my bedroom 
and it's just an eyesore , i think ,
well , yeah 
it is , it is , 
i've been thinking about putting the ironing board in the closet ,
and i wouldn't have to have that eyesore .
 , that's an idea . 
so , i have a big closet . 
i , you know , 
if i have , 
if i know i'm having somebody come over to the house and there's a possibility they might be going back into my room ,
 but i iron our clothes as we go along , 
 so , you know , 
i no longer do that weekly thing ,
and i'm like you ,
and that's it . 
because it's too many , 
hundred percent cotton . 
you can't iron it all 
and then with my kids , they're always getting into , you know , 
they can't decide what they want to wear so they ,
but she's still changes her mind two or three times ,
oh , i know , i know . 
and then they never put anything back . 
of course not . 
uh , that would be too simple . 
absolutely not .
that's right . 
our lot in life is to make her life miserable 
absolutely , absolutely . 
 well that's , 
it's been good talking to you , to hear somebody that does the same thing i do because i tell people what i do 
that's right .
so , uh , 
but , yeah , 
uh , we all keep our ironing boards out and just , uh , an ever present thing in our household 
i don't think i'd know what to do if it wasn't there , you know . 
my husband wouldn't know where to hang his dirty clothes . 
 there you go . 
things that need to be mended ,
he wouldn't know where to put things 
that's true . 
oh , well , it was nice talking with you . 
oh , it was nice talking with you , too . 
take care . 
take care . 
what are you interested in in restaurants ? 
right , uh . 
uh , once a week , twice a week ? 
oh , at least once a week . 
we're retired now . 
when we working out we ate out more than that .
i understand . 
uh , but we both work 
and we have a daughter , 
and we normally manage to eat out once a week anyway . 
well , what type of restaurant do you like , richard ? 
uh , really , i'm kind of open on food . 
i'm what you might call a culinary adventurer . 
been on a real barbecue kick lately . 
oh have you ? 
we like chinese . 
we eat ,
excuse me . uh , yeah , 
we usually have chinese once a month . 
what do you look for in a restaurant ? 
i hate franchised restaurants . 
you what ? 
oh i , 
i always prefer to go to something that seems more family run .
i know what you mean . 
i like some ambiance , 
and i like good food . 
i don't like fast food hamburgers and all of that . 
i don't , 
but i don't like something fake or put on either . 
you know , if i could have a good small restaurant or a good large restaurant i'd go to the good small restaurant . 
and i don't know why that is . 
i think it's probably due to pricing , often . 
i don't care to go to a place just for the price of it .
well , yeah , 
i mean , it's like continental french restaurant or something really 
and seven courses isn't what i usually look for .
oh , isn't . 
uh , i try to get my money's worth . 
and not just that , well , that's a big part of it . i try to get my money's worth .
well , like 
it's important . 
and we're trying to give them a little patronage . 
but sunday we went there , 
and i had a pretty good meal of grilled pork chops and a baked apple and potatoes . 
so i said if they would just add a little bit of cranberry sauce , something like that .
something a little extra 
that's what i mean by , 
and just for color if nothing else . 
it would mean a lot to the looks of the plate . 
what i miss up here is , i'm originally a texan , and i miss home cooked mexican . 
texmex , texmex . 
home cooked texmex . 
uh , mexican restaurants where it's not owned by an anglo or a corporation . 
i know . 
uh , we have a daughter in texas and one in new mexico , 
and we've really gotten to like , 
we like the real mexican food 
well , there's real mexican food 
and there's real texmex mexican , you know , by third or fourth generation americans 
oh , yes , 
and , of course , when you talk about mexican cuisine that's kind of like talking about american food or chinese food , its regional , too . 
that's true . 
i'm originally from maine , 
so we like seafood , too . 
and that's something we don't get here , 
and we're in the mountains in virginia . 
and most of the seafood's frozen . 
uh , yeah 
that's the way it is here in colorado , also . 
no fresh , or almost no fresh seafood 
 and in texas we got it from the gulf . 
that's true . 
lots of shrimp . 
and , yeah , 
here a couple years ago my wife and i went to seattle on vacation . 
and i think everything except breakfast was seafood for almost a week . 
i know it .
and it was , 
i was like a man starving at every meal . 
 i know the feeling . 
we do the same thing . 
my soninlaw is a texan , 
and when he goes to maine , he eats lobster , i guess , at least twice a day , all the time he's up there .
oh , yeah , 
it's like shrimp on the gulf . 
two ninetyeight a pound . 
that's as cheap as steaks some places 
oh yeah , 
a lot of the restaurants you can get two one pound lobsters for like ten ninetynine . 
oh , my gosh . 
i've got to go to maine then .
you may have sold a trip for some time . 
it's a good place to go . 
uh , it sounds wonderful . 
uh , so , 
lots of little restaurants , too , with home cooked food , that's up there . 
that sound good . 
uh , down in the gulf i've eaten a bunch of those little uh , seafood shacks , we've called them . 
and , uh , it's just so much different than to eat something that's been frozen .
we went to gal , 
shrimp straight out of the bay . 
we were in galveston last year well , the first of this year , actually . 
and , ate in a restaurant , 
and they claimed to have the best shrimp on the gulf coast . 
was it true ? 
on the way across louisiana , we pulled off , we saw a billboard and just pulled off taking a chance on a place . 
and they had , 
it was a small restaurant , just kind of out of the way , 
and they were set up with two buffets , one for their regular sunday chicken and roast beef and vegetables and everything .
 that was the best shrimp i have ever had in my life . 
they had shrimp fixed probably six different ways . 
uh , yes , 
the cajuns . 
it was wonderful . 
that no one else can . 
so , have you eaten crawfish yet ? 
but i didn't care for it . 
not there , but at my brothers i tried it . 
oh , as with anything , it's preparation . 
we just , 
he went down and bought some at a 
there's all kinds , 
probably needed some cold beer with it 
and  , 
 so you do eat out a lot . 
one of our other real problems with going out to eat , sunday morning brunches . 
you know , sunday brunch , all you can eat brunches . 
we used to do that , once in a while , 
but we don't anymore . 
uh , we still find it fun . 
it's fun , 
but it's just so much food .
hate to come away feeling uncomfortable .
well , i work in machine shop and do a lot of physical labor . 
do you , 
well that makes a difference . 
and so , 
where do you go to brunches ? 
like at hotels , or restaurants there ? 
oh , yeah , 
we eat at shoney's . 
in spite of the fact i've spoken so badly about chain restaurants , uh , we , uh , do like shoney's pretty well , 
but then there's a place up the pass , up in the mountains that we pretty reliably like to drive up to , i think it's about eight thousand foot elevation .
that sounds nice . 
it's the way to spend a nice sunday morning . 
i imagine it is . 
i think it's as much the trip to the mountains as it is the breakfast brunch . 
you know , and it's not that far . 
it's thirty miles . 
out of , which direction ? 
colorado springs . 
west out of colorado springs . 
what are your favorite programs ? 
uh , it's kind of hard to put my finger on a favorite t v program , 
however , uh , one that i've been watching for a number of years is dallas . 
oh , how funny . 
it's going to be its last show . 
so i've , i've kind of enjoyed watching over the years . 
i've been disappointed in it and also pleased in it . 
and , uh , i was , uh , greatly disappointed , uh , when i did move down to plano to , uh , find out that uh , the , uh , great south fork ranch was really only a one bedroom house . 
i've seen the sign that goes to there . 
well i think i've seen it in the distance . 
but i have not even seen it . 
and i have not seen the program . 
so  , 
and , uh , i know when we went to london , it was really funny . 
uh , people recognized dallas , texas , by the cowboys 
and that's the two things they associate with dallas , texas . 
and i , 
they asked me , uh , 
and i didn't know what they were talking about . 
it took me a long time , they're talking about the viaducts . 
is that , 
darned if i know .
i was blank looking , you know . 
i felt really dumb . 
well , it's , it's , uh , 
when you look at the , uh , you know , route seventyfive , coming down there . i mean , it's actually a bridge , 
but it's a bridge over top of roadway . 
there's no water there . i mean , uh , 
well , there's water in the trinity . 
i thought it was going to oak cliff over the trinity . 
well there , uh , 
well they , 
i think when they open the show up they give you two different views of dallas . 
oh , do they ? 
one from the east and one from the west . 
and that's why . 
oh , i see . 
but it kind of confuses people . 
but , uh , uh , i enjoy , uh , uh , a lot of different comedies . 
um , i think it's mainly for an escape , um , you know , uh , my job is not the most thrilling in the world 
and then there's other ones that , uh , deal with , uh , in a funny manner , uh , socially relevant things . 
and , uh , one show that comes to mind is like designing women . uh , 
i think that is just a hoot . 
that's one of those few that i do watch when the television is on . 
my husband likes to watch t v . 
it's on . 
i usually read and watch t v . 
but that's one of the few that i just actually watch . 
i really enjoy that one . 
uh , it has been very entertaining 
open your eyes as well as your mind to some of the problems . 
and , uh , i've really enjoyed that one since it came on . 
um , i don't like the politics surrounding the program though , 
but , i mean , other than that , you know , there seems to be a little in fighting going on between the producers and one of the actresses . 
but , uh , 
and then , uh , i've kind of gotten hooked on p b s stuff , uh , public , uh , t v . 
uh , i like things like nova and , uh , some of the special programs they come up with on nature and stuff . 
i just enjoy watching that stuff . 
now , we watch a lot of those . 
uh , and the ones that sometimes will hook me , to put down my book , will be the one , there was one , uh , recently about the gettysburg address . 
and they wrapped a fictional story around it . 
and i thought that was well done . 
and it , it caught my attention . 
i wound up watching the whole thing . 
uh , i guess the awards ceremonies , and there seems to be dozens of them per year . 
maybe i've spent two minutes watching to see what they on and if they make a fool of themselves or not .
but they could take that whole collection 
and it would disappear 
i , particularly take issue with those . 
i really dislike those . 
well i'm one of those rare guys , who , i rarely ever sit down and watch a whole sporting event , um , if ever watch one . 
uh , there's just not that much i'm interested in . 
um , for a while , i watched some football , 
but i've just got too many more important things in my life now than to sit around and watch a baseball game . 
you know , my husband used to just be riveted to the dallas cowboys . 
and now , we're out running around , 
and if they're playing , he'll turn it on while we're in the car to see what the score is , 
and he'll listen . 
let me run in here , 
and i'll do some things 
and i'll come back 
and he doesn't , he doesn't watch it . 
he list , like i say , 
but he just doesn't watch them on t v like he used to . 
well i think it was great when they were , you know , like world champs and they were doing real well . 
uh , i 
personally , i came from the washington area . 
and so 
oh , those people . 
and , uh , when i came down to dallas , uh , you know , i found myself rooting for the home team . 
i , uh , 
in fact i have uh , a baseball hat that was signed by tony dorsett and hershel walker 
oh , how neat . 
well , i actually got to go see them win in the super bowl when they went down to new orleans . 
oh , wow . 
and , and everything
but , i don't know , i haven't been as , 
i'll tell you what i love to watch . and this is not , this is rarely on television . 
but what is a lot of fun to go attend , is this arena football . 
i like it so much better than straight football . 
i haven't seen that . 
it doesn't , 
it has a lot of different rules . 
the field is half the size 
 and there's no , 
it moves a lot faster . 
uh . gee , i'll have to try to catch that sometime . 
uh , again i think it may be on cable more than anything else . 
we don't either . 
uh , i couldn't rationalize paying , you know , 
it's like if i pay for a movie channel , then i have watch what movies they want me to watch when they want me to watch them . 
and you know , if i didn't use cable for anything else other than the basic , well i can get that for free . 
and well , i really don't need c n n , i see enough bad news all the time . 
i don't need to see more of it . 
so it's probably a lot more economical for us to just go rent the movies we want to see . 
and of course when we were living in texas , it was real convenient with tom thumb . 
you know , having movies , uh , back then it was ninetynine cents . 
i mean , go , 
they're everywhere , they're 
um . you can see them a lot sooner than you can see them on any of the stations like h b o or cinemax . 
well , and i like to rent tapes because you can put the thing on hold if you get a telephone call or something like that . 
or it becomes snack time for various reasons . 
you can put , you know , 
the only thing , this dance with wolves , i want to see it in a theater . 
oh , yes . 
i do too . 
because i understand that , you'll lose fifty percent of it if you don't . 
and uh , i've been trying to get my wife to go with me to go see it . 
she doesn't like going to movie theaters because usually they're dirty , 
and , uh , you know , she just doesn't like them . 
and , um , she doesn't think that she could sit still for three hours and watch the movie . 
and i've told her , you know , everybody i know that has seen it has said that the three hours go really quick . 
that's what i hear too . 
and , uh , so i'm hoping i can get her talked into it soon . 
well , my husband smokes . 
he's one of the dinosaurs that still smokes . 
and you can't smoke in movie theaters . 
and that has really slowed down the forward progress of going to movies . 
but i haven't really cared up until this point . 
but i , 
we are this weekend going to go see dance with wolves . 
that's it . 
we will do it . 
that's great . 
but that i would be afraid to admit to you that i've actually sat down and watched .
and then there's others that , uh , uh , i wish i had time to see . 
it's like i enjoy watching cheers . 
it's very funny . 
some of the things in it are mindless , 
but i just don't have time to watch it . 
um , i think about the only night that i really sit in front of the t v set all night long probably is on monday night . 
because , um , i work so hard over the weekend , doing other things with the kids and stuff and going to work on monday . 
monday night i'm just worn out . 
so i kind of use it as the time to catch up on correspondence and look over things . 
and i can sit in front of the t v set and look at , you know , and watch t v at the same time . 
well , i tend , 
and to sit down and to mindlessly either read or just mindlessly stare in absolute comfort isn't as bad as it used to , 
i'm actually at work . 
oh , o , .
i'm in facilities and happen to have , uh , weekend duty here . 
oh , okay . 
what building do you work in ? 
i'm in the south building . 
oh , okay . 
we pull mostly evenings . 
we are having , 
there's three of us , uh , facilities' managers are covering the off shifts . just to have somebody here , uh , from management to , uh , see if they need anything . 
oh , okay . 
oh , the , 
this is the , 
go ahead , you first .
when the phone rings and you've got a recording , and this always happens like around five or six o'clock ,
okay , yeah . 
and then it won't go away 
and where they call all the time , you know . 
there are evenings especially friday nights , thursday and friday nights . 
well , we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night . 
more people call , that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall , you know , your sitting down to eat and the phone rings 
the worst one , i guess , is like you , when it's a recording . i don't mind so much someone calls 
and it's a salesperson , at least you can chat or whatever and say , okay , now , we want to go  , 
and then a computer ,
oh , yeah . 
uh , shut my other radio off here .
that's real irritating to me . 
uh , i guess they get their name , 
i'm amazed the   question about that the , 
my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine 
and i have one too , 
 and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long , if they catch your answering machine , 
they can leave their whole spiel on it . 
they can erase all your others , you know , because if you have , 
i think that's the way it is , no , mine , i guess , if it's full , it will not take it , i'm not sure . 
but they can certainly , uh , block your answering machine so someone else calls you , uh , and your answering machine is full , you know , 
but your right . *[[your you're
that was a good one . 
that's a high irritant for me . 
drives me crazy . 
and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times  these  computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them . 
and so it really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not , you know , you have a unlisted number or not . 
and they pass around , uh , cards that have everybody's name on it . 
like if you order something through a mail order catalog ,
or they sell their catalog list of people ,
but it's , uh , annoyance for me in the office with , uh , speaker phones . 
you know , i , 
they're great for an office 
but this one guy next to me , who's not here just so i could talk about him ,
and it carries over 
and so not only would you hear , 
it seems to me that you you kind of yell into it . 
uh , and so he yells into it , 
and you hear the other person too , 
so it's kind of a double annoyance . 
he actually , uh , ruins my privacy you might say because the , the t i offices are so open anyway .
i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and annoying , you know . 
uh , that's ,
but i think it is , 
and yo , 
we both picked phone items there . 
oh , yeah . 
let's see , i'm trying to think . 
oh , have you heard that , i'm trying to think of what company it was , there was a company that was going to , uh , be giving out information about your financial status . 
oh , yeah , 
i heard something about , not that exactly , 
but go ahead . 
well , um , i work in the computer science center 
and so we hear a lot about things that computers are capable of doing . 
and , uh , this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it . 
and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera , et cetera . 
and , uh , they finally , uh , stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused ,
and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either . 
i mean , there was a lot of stuff going on about it . 
well , i , uh , heard something similar to that . 
i listen to , 
i'm a , uh , uh , talk show person . 
and there was , 
when i do my chores up at the rad , 
i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean . 
and so i listened to , was it five seventy , which has continuous talk on the weekends ,
and , uh , i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a financial application , all that information on there is really not necessarily , 
whether it's your personal salary or whatever . 
uh , if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down 
and i was curious as to you did have to put down . 
but he says social security , you don't need to put that down there . which i thought was surprising . 
so maybe there's something along that same line where , you know , in all these financial , uh , applications that you make out , you don't have to put all that stuff down there . 
it would be nice to know what was , 
but , you know , some things will be private , you know , 
well , that's real interesting . 
i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need ,
and there it is . 
that's all they really care about . 
they just want that credit history to see if you're a   person . 
if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that . 
i haven't , 
i don't have any friends down at the austin plant , 
but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing , 
and we seem to up here have just breezed through that 
and apparently some other companies are having trouble 
i don't have any trouble with it . 
uh , it's kind of unusual here we are in dallas , you know , the biggest location and it just breezed through 
and there were , whether it was a class action or how far it got , i don't really know because t i only had a few things on t i news i think about it ,
but the , 
some people object to that which i don't mind ,  no  problem at all , you know . 
oh , i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it 
so you get kind of used to , 
you know , you don't pay any attention to it . i mean , 
once you sign over your soul to uncle sam ,
i know . 
but  , 
i know , yeah . 
i served my time too , yeah . 
so , to deal with anything like that have learned , you know , it's just one of those things . 
you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it . 
but i do know that there are several  sites  .
i didn't , 
i wasn't aware that austin was one of them , 
but i think johnson city was one . 
oh , did they object too ? 
well , i'm all for it . 
uh , it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or , you know , carry it to wherever you want to carry it really , uh , 
but , uh , i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it . 
uh , uh , and i think it is , they found that it's been very low really . 
i guess maybe at the locations though , i don't know if they have it done but , done it by location . 
i don't really know if , uh , they need to publish that really . 
oh , i don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and ,    , on an individual basis . 
i mean , 
but i think that was actually a good thing that happened , uh , i never considered it , i guess , it's an invasion of your privacy 
but it's something that is for the good of so many people , you know , to ,
 oh , sure . 
and i can just imagine if , you know ,  , you know , some guy being on drugs they go there 
and they fall out because of the drug issue ,
but the   use of drugs or anything like that ,
really haven't thought about any of this . 
they had gardening yesterday and all the repairs , 
and , boy , i could , 
what did you buy ? 
a ford explorer . 
i'm sorry , what ? 
oh , really . 
and , um , i'd probably buy another , this is the first american vehicle i've owned . 
so i would probably purchase another one , um , i would be more selective in the dealership that i purchased it from 
but as far as , uh , the quality seems to be there , um , it's quiet , it handles well , um , 
but i believe i'd get that or a porsche , one of the two . 
oh really ? 
not  , 
um , if i had the money , i think i would love to own a , a b m w . 
and why would that be ? 
i don't know , i , 
from what , or 
either that or mercedes , just because they're put together so well . 
it seems like they last forever . 
what's wrong with the volvo . 
oh , i don't know , they're not as nice looking . 
 uh , m , 
to me , i don't know , i'm sure there are some that are , 
but everyone i've seen is kind of plain , 
what city are you calling from ? 
where are you ? 
up in dallas . 
dallas . 
b m w or mercedes , yeah , 
well that's a , 
if i um , had the money , i mean that's just , 
i know i never would own one , 
but , uh , i don't know . i like , 
my actual favorite cars were , uh , like the ford thunderbirds 
i really like that body style , 
but i don't own one of those either .
what do you presently drive ? 
uh , mercury topaz . 
um , fun . 
cheap taste in cars , okay .
well there nothing wrong with those , uh . 
um , it's just everybody has their own taste , 
but man the mercedes are expensive . 
my wife has a volvo 
sorry i roped on volvos then .
oh no , 
i kind of wish we would have maybe gone for the g l rather than the d l 
oh , is it ? 
see i don't much about them i guess . 
there just safe to just , 
that's the reason why we mainly got it . 
we got white 
and it's the safest four door , you know , if you have a family , which we do . 
we just 
  one out 
and so it's , uh , um , you know , 
they're kind of low to the ground after driving the explorer . 
you know , i presently , 
i used to have a two , eighty z , 
and i'm a tall guy 
and , uh , they're hard to get around in traffic to see . 
because you can't see a car ahead of you , 
but they're fast as lightning and all that crap . 
but the explorer , i mean , you're sitting up on top of everything 
and you can really see real well . 
and i just , 
it's so comfortable 
what are your feelings about american versus european cars ? 
um , i like anything besides japanese . 
of course everything has japanese parts in them anymore . 
i don't like japanese cars , 
why not . 
but , uh , european , i don't have any , i mean , 
those are the kind i usually end up liking the most . 
american cars , a lot of people say they don't last long 
but i've never had any problem with , um , my mercury , 
my cous , 
my husband has a , uh , cougar 
and he's never had any problem with it either , 
so , i don't know . 
that's the way it goes , i guess . 
 well what are your , 
i guess this is your first time to buy american , 
but it was  , 
i don't know , uh , i mean , i think european cars are great , course you've got to have metric wrenches and stuff 
and they're eas , 
some of them are easy to work on . 
a volvo , being a four cylinder is very easy to work on . 
uh , excellent warranty , i mean , just , unbelievable warranty . 
and , uh , of course , ford isn't too bad . 
i think chrysler would probably make a good vehicle , 
uh , but all of it has to do , in my opinion with the service .
i wouldn't send my dog to buy a car from middlekauff ford . 
their just , 
their attitude is just slimy . 
a letter to middlekauff 
and it will never change about that place . 
and , uh , 
but , uh , anyway that's my own personal comment i guess , 
this girl that works for me just bought a car down there 
and sh , 
they hadn't signed any papers 
and they had all ready , uh , taken it in to paint it and everything 
and everything was stolen out of it 
and the people , um , wouldn't reimburse them for anything . 
middlekauff wouldn't ? 
she needs to find herself a lawyer . 
she'd come out like a champ on that one . 
so , i've heard some stuff about them . 
but , um . 
so have you been using , well anyway . 
that was , 
but that's , 
a week . 
good lord , 
oh , wow . 
 well look , i've enjoyed speaking with you . 
you too . 
and keep smiling . 
bye , bye . 
uh , well , we only have one child right now and another one on the way 
and right now i'm all with her during the day . 
if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find , if i was close to home , relatives or people with as parents . 
and what religious faith ? 
uh , latter day saints . 
with a teaching background i've , um , had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations 
but i've seen some good ones 
and i've seen some really bad ones . 
 and so , 
by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they , uh , kind of , uh , eliminate a lot of the , uh , 
better situations . 
the , the , uh , 
what am i trying to think of that , not the imagination but the creativity in the situation 
and so , 
that's very well phrased . 
uh , so , have you ever used outside child care ? 
we've had like people come in and babysit for an hour or two 
but i've never had , um , 
real day care . 
she's not even a year yet , 
our step daughter's ten now 
 and most of the day care has been provide for by grandma . 
but , quite honestly what i believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up , the pass of woodland park 
and they would read and play , 
have structured , 
seem to be , 
uh , yeah , 
and , uh , despite our beliefs , she was , uh , one of the more , uh , charismatic christian faiths 
 and it worked out wonderfully . 
i know knowledge of who's a available , then you could probably find some really good care . 
uh , yeah , 
but i don't know that it would be state approved . 
that's true . 
you can get somebody maybe willing to babysit 
but actual , you know , that's sometimes done on a different scale . 
i have even considered , you know , babysitting myself , i have a teaching degree , and , uh , thought well , you know , i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to , 
but i think if you take more than three children in , well , 
that was how it was this virginia , we've recently moved here to texas , but in virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed . 
now i don't know what the current texas laws are 
but i do know that the license doesn't seem to , uh , guarantee quality . 
a lot of times you might just need to go now and file for it just like a business . 
you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't , 
uh , now here i believe that child care meets , by in large , certain standards for , uh , balanced food , if they provide food , cleanliness , and levels of supervision 
that's , uh , kind of a minimum there that you're getting . 
your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children , you know , like the educational activities , the supervised play and so forth . 
uh , my wife is , uh , agnostic 
and i'm , uh , a backsliding presbyterian 
 and , uh , i really believe that this charismatic care , or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care , or semi charismatic i might say 
it was a good influence for your daughter , uh . 
well , that's good . 
 and , uh , the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child . 
a little bit of love and attention is what most of them need . 
you know , even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program 
and not have any care . 
and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself 
and so , 
and i'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se . 
do you know had a i'm saying ? 
well , even educated play , uh , supervised play , can teach without , 
and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills 
and , uh , uh , you know , like my child that , 
she want be an only child for long , 
but , you know , she was an only child , 
or maybe your daughter ,
proper interface . 
it's of social skills , if you will . 
those basic things that , you know , you would be a little bit of , uh , i don't know if manners is a good term or not but ,
that's done through example , you know , not an actual sit down learn situation 
uh , yeah , 
uh , it's a very broad issue . 
it is .
and , you know , it's a shame 
but most people doing , child care earn almost no money . 
they operate at , you know , 
the owner of the chi , of a , you know , a large child care facility now , 
we're not talking somebody that does six kids ,
somebody that doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it . 
you mean somebody that has an actual establishment . 
their employees earn almost nothing . 
i know i did that for summer 
so i can vouch for that .
and that's really , really a shame too because , 
do you and your husband both work . 
well , that's wonderful if you can make it that way . 
well , we decided to , 
we live on a lesser budget so that we have 
as , uh , there may come a time when i will be working again , you know , 
but right now that's what we've chosen 
and we wanted to have several , 
we got her 
and we've got another on the way ,
so  , 
 but more and more we as americans are being forced into a situation , where you've got to have , 
well , i'm talking to you from dallas . 
what part of the country are you in ? 
i guess the weather hasn't been too different between us . 
what part of dallas are you from ? 
far north dallas .
oh , north dallas . 
about a half a mile from plano .
well , jeez . 
 so we're in the , 
 well then you've been getting quite a bit of rain also . 
how about that . 
how does it compare to the years past ? 
 um , i don't know , i haven't lived here , let's see , we lived out of state in wisconsin 
and we just c , 
we lived here ten years ago , 
and when we first lived here , we were in garland , east richardson ,
and , i don't know , then graduate schooling , 
and it just , 
it's a lot cleaner up there , 
but , um , it's a lot colder too . 
well , what brought you guys down to texas then ? 
uh , his job , he came back to start work again for a different company , 
how about that . 
here we are again . 
that's great . 
it just seems a little more humid than it , 
i don't ever remember , of course , you know , you only remember the good stuff , 
but , um , i just don't remember the humidity . 
this much rain , and this much humidity . 
uh , yeah , 
they are . 
actually , though , it was a lot rainier here in the winter , uh , we came back last august . 
it's just a lot rainier than i remember it , all through the seasons , you know . 
it seems that progressive , 
i've , been down here five years , just over five years now , that , every spring and summer seems to get more and more rainy . 
and i think it's because it's just getting more crowded and more polluted . 
i really do think that's part of it . 
um , uh , the winters are bad , but not what you hear about . 
it's just like down here , when people here think it's a hundred and six , people up north think it's a hundred and sixty down here . 
a hundred and sixty . 
i'm making that up . 
 you know , when it's only like ninetyfive . 
um , it's just like up there , when you hear it's forty below , it's probably really only five below . 
um , and it's so dry , that it's like going to ar , 
well , probably what arizona used to be like , you know , 
so it's not what you think it is . 
um , no , 
there have been times , though , when it gets so frigid that you  ,
where did you move here from ? 
well , there , 
you could talk about that's , 
 oh sure , i'm uh , 
my grandparents and all my relatives are from wisconsin . 
oh , there you go , okay . 
so , i'm , uh , quite familiar with how it is up there , 
and if you , 
kind of interesting , uh , the people down here typically don't think it gets above , you know , fifty degrees .
 this is very true . 
and it's always snow , you know , 
but , uh , 
well actually , the summers up there , we thought , were the most beautiful time of the year . 
oh yes . 
um , in terms of colorado , i know my husband likes to camp and backpack and all the stuff i don't like , um , 
but i'd , 
used to go on , 
i worked for a mortgage company in wisconsin 
and i did a lot of business in , uh , um , well , denver , 
and that's probably one of the stranger things , when you see the air inversions ,
and it's snowy 
and uh , it just was a very mixed bag in terms of colorado . 
 oh sure . 
my parents just live , uh , thirty miles south of denver 
and it can be sunny and no problem in denver 
and they'll be having snow .
isn't that strange ? 
so it's pretty amazing , it can be that drastic in just a short distance .
and then things like torn , 
are there tornadoes in colorado , yes or n , i don't , 
it used to be no problem , just because it was such a rugged terrain and with trees everywhere , 
but now ,
the mountains , 
even , i mean , 
i'm originally from pittsburgh , pennsylvania , 
and i can tell you that , um , they've even had , 
in eastern ohio and western pennsylvania , they've even had , i'm going to say , mini tornadoes for lack of a better word . 
and that's just a part of the country that it's rolling hillside . 
that was unheard of , you know , twenty years ago . 
um , so i don't know what's happening , if it's , you know , we are , the greenhouse , i don't really know . 
me neither . 
it's just , you know . 
i know i associate the pollution with weather in general , 
so i guess one thing we do miss , is that's a smaller town , 
and it was , 
it just seemed a little bit more pleasant in terms of the atmosphere , you know . 
well , it's been good talking to you . 
you too . 
what kind of things do you like to do in your spare time ? 
well , uh , i have two children , 
so i do not have a whole lot of spare time right now . 
one of the things that i have made time for is , uh , playing softball . 
i really enjoy , 
i enjoy softball , 
but i enjoy all kind of sports . 
i enjoy watching and participating . 
i really like water sports like swimming and skiing , 
but i do not get to do that too often . 
and then i really enjoy sewing , 
but i do not get much of a chance to just really sit down and do much sewing . 
how about you ? 
oh , i , uh , like sports type things too . 
we like to get out and walk , 
and we like the water sports too . 
but like you , unless you have a pool in your backyard , it is kind of hard to get to do that 
i , know it . 
it is . 
do you work full time ? 
part time . 
so part of my big hobby has been trying to put together a nursery and all that kind of stuff , lately . 
that definitely takes over your time . 
it does . 
i have been , 
is this going to be your first ? 
i have been doing some crossstitch for something i wanted to put in the nursery . 
so , i have not 
but i have kind of enjoyed that . 
it is just hard to find the time to sit there and do it . 
well , that is , 
it sure is fun to do that kind of thing because then you have got something to show for it . 
that is neat . 
and i guess i kind of consider shopping a hobby .
i do too . 
i just go out just to enjoy it and not 
but you will probably find after your children get bigger , uh , like when they want things like tricycles , toys , things that cost quite a lot in the store , you can find that kind of stuff at garage sales for just a few dollars . 
so , i am , 
i have become a garage sale shopper . 
and it is fun . 
on the weekends i drive around , look to see , you know , who is selling what . 
and i found my little daughter some tap shoes for her tap class .
and i got them for two dollars .
it is . 
it does take more time . 
but i do not work , 
so , uh , that is something i have decided i am going to make sure my kids have a happy growing up years 
and  , 
i think that is important too . 
i am not 
so , i 
i am glad , 
i do not know .
well , at first , when you first have a baby , uh , seems to take every moment of your time . partly because you are not used to , you know , juggling your time around like that . 
but i think , my husband is real into sports too . 
he plays on a t i softball team and the church softball team . 
and by the time he plays two games a week and i play a game a week , we go to lots of softball .
but the kids enjoy going because there's usually a lot of other kids for them to play with 
and that is getting outside and , you know , doing things they like to do too . 
so that is good . 
a whole fam , 
your whole family can enjoy those hobbies . 
and one other thing we are doing this year is , uh , we bought wet and wild passes . 
we have never done that before , 
but the kids are always wanting to play in the water . 
and , uh , like you said , unless you have a pool in your backyard or access to a good place to play , it is kind of hard . 
and , uh , they have real good kiddie areas , uh , at both of the wet and wild's around here . 
so , we are planning on going two or three times a week .
oh , wow . 
that will make the summer go by in a hurry . 
i think it will . 
keep the kids busy . 
because my oldest daughter is in school , 
and she gets bored real fast when she is home with nothing to do . 
so , i think that will be a lot of fun . 
so we are looking forward to that . 
uh , do you consider yard work a hobby at all 
or is that just a chore ? .
but my husband and i both , i think , consider it a chore . 
our yard has had so many problems . 
it has completely died out two times . 
oh , no . 
and , uh , we have had to start all over trying to plant grass . 
so it has become a chore .
do you and your husband like to work in the yard ? 
i like to put flowers out and , you know , 
but as far as 
that is true . 
seems like sometimes hobbies do that . 
they kind of take over and turn into work instead of 
well , that is how sewing . 
i love to sew , 
and , uh , i wish i had more time to do it . 
but sometimes i will get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than  , 
if it does not go quite , quite right . 
another thing i enjoy doing is cooking . 
i like especially , 
it is real strange , 
but i like to cook for other people . 
like i have a friend that is , uh , pregnant 
but she can't get up and walk around right now . 
oh , no . 
so , i enjoy , you know , cooking things to take over to her house 
oh , that is nice . 
and it is fun for me to do that . 
it is something i enjoy doing . 
it is funny though , it is like i do not really want to cook for us .
it is kind of like when you are a kid and someone else's house was fun to clean , 
how funny . 
i think i will enjoy cooking more when i am not working , when i 
oh , yeah . 
it is not fun . 
but i think i will like it better . 
when you are home 
well , do you guys go camping or anything like that ? 
uh , yeah , 
we like that . 
there again , it is just so hard to find time to get away 
well , that is something that we are planning to do not this weekend , but the next . 
my parents go camping a lot , 
and they invited the kids and my husband and me to go with them 
that sounds fun . 
we are really looking forward to it . 
the girls love it . 
they have been a couple of times , and , uh , just getting to be outside , you know , all the time and sleep in a tent . that is really fun to them . 
well , that sounds nice . 
i think that would be a good family thing 
uh , my husband loves to fish . 
i am not much into fishing , 
but , uh , my daughter thinks she wants to learn how to fish 
they can go fishing . 
we have camped with some friends who have young children 
oh , they have so much fun doing that . 
and they think they are really great fishermen 
oh , i know . 
uh , she is really looking forward . 
i am hoping , 
that is another thing though , when sometimes your , uh , hobbies can interfere with each other . 
because my husband is afraid he is going to have a softball tournament that weekend . 
skip this tournament .
if you are doing a lot of things , sometimes you have conflicts , 
and you have to decide what you enjoy the most . 
do you do any other crafts or anything besides your sewing ? 
i keep thinking when the kids get bigger and i have a little more time , uh , i would love to crossstitch . 
i think crossstitching is so pretty , 
but i have never done any . 
it is not too hard . 
it is , 
i do not think it is as hard as like knitting or 
i crocheted when i was younger . 
it is funny , when i was in high school , i made a blanket . 
but you know , i can't even remember how i did it now .
it has been so long since i did it that 
i started to knit a sweater . 
and i got off on my rows somehow , 
and so what should have been the back all of a sudden was on the front . 
oh , yeah . 
and then i tore it out and threw it down . 
 and i never have ,
and now i can't remember anything about it .
well , i did the same thing . 
uh , when i was pregnant with my first daughter , i was really bored , 
and i bought one of those latch hook rug kits . 
oh , uhhuh . 
it was a real pretty rug . 
and oh , it was so , 
it was beautiful , 
but i did not realize how long it took . 
and i got about twothirds of it done , 
and then i just , 
i had the baby .
and then it was just like 
forget it . 
and every once in a while i will be digging through the closet , 
and i will find that thing . 
but , uh , for a while there latch hook rugs were a real big , uh , hobby . 
i remember that . 
it seemed like people did them a lot . 
uh , uh , people do not do that much any more . 
so , it was something easy i could do .
they are pretty easy . 
well , it has been real good talking to you . 
you too . 
and i hope you enjoy your camping trip . 
oh , thank you . 
and thanks for calling . 
 well i always think i'm paying too much taxes . 
how about you ? 
 seems  like , 
although at least texas doesn't have a state income tax yet . 
i mean , you know , they keep threatening us that maybe there will be a day that they're going to , uh , the , um , other means of providing  income  for the state have been dwindling 
so they keep trying to say we may need a , uh , state income tax .
i think that , uh , we probably will i , come here from new york 
and new york had a state lottery , 
and it really raised a lot of money for the state . 
uh , although we , 
in new york we had to pay a state and a city , uh , tax . 
and it was really a great relief when i got to texas that i didn't have to pay that city income tax , though . 
makes quite a bit of difference in uh , well your income level . 
you know , because other states quite a bi , a chunk out for , uh , city and state taxes 
so you're , uh , looking at your yearly salary , it makes quite a difference . 
a little more take home here .
do you live in dallas ? 
oh , you do ? 
oh , i do too . 
oh , okay .
and then , you know too , that , um , taxes are less , like if you live in mesquite . 
you know , some people will go shopping in mesquite at the malls out there , uh , 
or up to collin county , somewhere that you're getting out of the , um , dallas county area because ,
eight point five . 
which , yeah , that really is pretty high . 
is it the s , 
is it , uh , less in collin county than it is in dallas county ? 
or .  guess maybe if i was going to buy a car or something ,
it sure did 
and then once you could deduct at least some of that , um , off your income tax 
and you can't do that anymore . 
it really hit me yesterday , i had , uh , air conditioning service for my car done . 
and i had a little , little , uh , coupon special that was twentytwo dollars 
and if you needed another pound of freon they ga , 
it was like seven dollars and something . 
and then i ended up paying like thirtyfour dollars . 
that's true . 
although i wish , you know , overall they'd try the lottery again . 
when did you first come to texas ? .
really , where did you come from ? 
um , well , ohio , kind of . 
my parents live in ohio . 
i had lived a little while in michigan , 
oh , uhhuh . 
but , you know , basically i went to high school and college in ohio and lived there uh , more years than i ever did in michigan . 
well , uh , i did visit , uh , michigan , i visited kalamazoo once . 
my sister used to live there . 
oh , okay .
 but you know , when we first came down here , i really thought this place was somewhat backward , i mean , i was just shocked that we couldn't shop on sunday . 
remember that ? .
but , uh , there were stores that you could go to , uh , you know , like discount stores and stores down in the village and just all over the place where you could go to
and you could shop until like twelve or one o'clock that night 
and that was really the only night they were open that late , 
but it was christmas eve . 
and when i came to dallas , i thought i was going to do that christmas eve 
and i couldn't find hardly anything open ,
and i think target was the one that stayed open later than anybody else . 
and , uh , i was able to pick up a few things in there , 
but , boy i was really shocked . 
and then another shock i had  ,
oh , few places now seem to do it by the slice 
but they , 
back then they didn't . 
when i first came , no . 
well uh , there was other things too , i mean , i think it's taken us yankee's influence down here ,
um , i couldn't believe that you could have open containers of beer , alcohol , whatever ,
 i mean , you could always , um , uh , be careful about that back then because ,
and people would just drink openly . 
i used to smoke , you know 
 and , uh , that would have been enough me give them up . 
the price of them now , 
but i gave them up a couple years ago because i had some sinus problems . 
i don't smoke , 
so i don't really know what the ,
well they're like two , 
or , i believe they're hitting two dollars a pack now . 
a little bit more in some places . 
so you end up about paying about twelve dollars for a pack and two dollars of that is taxes . 
um , because i remember we went this bingo place . this choctaw bingo , uh , a couple weeks ago 
and somebody that went with me bought a carton for , uh , ten dollars and something 
and they really thought they were getting a big discount . 
they're cheaper there ? 
in oklahoma . 
oh , i got you , 
and , uh , it was a indian , well it's a bingo hall for the benefit of the indians there . 
although i didn't see very many indian people in there .
there were just bus loads of people that come from everywhere else to play that bingo because it's , the stakes are higher and payoffs are bigger and so forth . 
well how did you do ? 
a dollar , oh well , 
one guy won t , 
do you have any pets ? 
and i've , 
i am a golden retriever fan , 
but i had to replace it with something that the kids could carry . 
instead of being carried .
well , they were , 
they really wanted something teeny tiny , 
and i , uh , really wanted that retriever's disposition .
so i called four or five dog trainers because i don't like the little dogs . 
and the only thing that they could come up with was a bichon frize which is a , 
do you know what that is ? 
they're cute . 
they look like an air headed   let me tell you . 
they're calm , they're not  yuppie   , they're trainable , they're , uh , very personable in a different way that a golden retriever is . 
they're not dignified like a retriever can be . 
so how old is your retriever ? 
oh , she's about four . 
she's not completely pure . 
we got her from the , uh , humane society when she was a puppy . 
she looks like a gol , 
she looks just like a golden retriever , 
but she's a little bit smaller . 
she's like fiftyfive pounds . 
well , actually , you know , that's the breed standard for females . 
what you , 
is it ? 
that is not breed standard . 
fiftyfive is the minimum 
but they usually run about sixty to sixtyfive . 
and the ones that are shown , they are inside that weight allowance . 
you cannot show your retriever if it's , you know , a hundred plus pounds . 
oh , huh . 
so don't say she's small ,
she's perfect . 
well , she's got a brown nose instead of black too . 
which makes her , i guess , unshowable ,
but we love her anyway . 
she's just a lot of company to us . 
we didn't , 
we haven't had any kids 
and we're expecting a baby this summer , 
but up until then , she's been our substitute kid 
and she was a lot of fun . 
well , they are the ultimate dog to have around kids so long as your kid is not scared of a big dog ,
and fortunately it was just like a retriever 
and then i've had a retriever . 
i bet it had a pretty coat too . 
it was gorgeous . 
um , and they both , you know , 
both the half breed and the pure breed had the , the perfect disposition . 
but you know what scares me about golden retrievers ? 
since they've become so popular you get what i call backyard breeders .
and in the retrievers it happens to be they like them big , for somehow big is perceived as the better . 
and when you start doing that you really tamper with , you know , the years of , uh , culling litters 
and , uh , you tamper with what the dog innately is . 
we w , 
when i was , 
when i bought my last purebred retriever i mean i looked all over because i wanted one that still looked like a retriever , you know , the short to the ground , stocky , golden , uh , trainable , tractable , quiet 
and i ended up getting one that , uh , came out of a hunting stock 
and i've seen an awful lot of lately really dumb , 
and i'm , and i really fear for the breed because i love that breed , 
but i really figure right when it becomes really popular that it's going to be ruined . 
we have some friends with a brother and sister golden retriever 
and those dogs have been having seizures , 
and i wonder since both of them are having them if it's some kind of breeding 
oh , yeah . 
you bet you . 
you know how they came up with the retriever , don't you , the golden ? 
it was bred out of several different retrievers , 
and they bred it for companionship and , uh , uh , disposition and ability to hunt . 
it was kept only by kings . 
but they selectively culled those litters , i mean , for many hundreds of years 
and since it slept in the castle with its master ,  i mean  it had to be of a disposition to make it , you know , an animal you could keep around that closely . 
but they would go through all the litters and destroy the puppies if they were anything other than perfect . 
now , you know , that seems like a cruel thing to do . 
on the other hand , a wonderful breed ,
they did . 
i had never really had a golden retriever before . 
we were going to get a shepherd and something mixed because my husband's family had had shepherds 
and all the other , 
we looked at some of the shepherd mixes and the puppies weren't very , uh , social and stuff . 
and we went to a pen of a little bit bigger dogs 
and all the others were standing there barking and jumping up and down . 
and one dog would stand there wagging her tail and smiling .
and that ,
well , i tell you ,
only in america is there a dog called a german shepherd . 
oh , really ? 
that dog is bred out of three european dogs . the belgian tervurien , a german skutzhund , and a  , i always forget the third one . i can see it . 
uh , uh , i , 
but the third one is a children's dog . 
and there are distinct breeds in europe . 
now what happened over here was is that people saw the first , um , which would actually have been a skutzhund which is what rin tin tin was . 
and everybody wanted rin tin tin . 
and it was known as a german shepherd here . 
so they created a breed standard . the american kennel club did . 
that said anything that is a skutzhund , that's the other one . alsatian , any inner breeding of that can be called a german shepherd here . 
and what happened is , is that people wanted this shepherd to shepherd and protect . 
and they bred a dog that an animal's critical span which basically translates to how much shit will it take before it bites you . 
that german shepherd , the american german shepherd here was such an unreliable animal that the american seeing eye institute 
and even , um , uh , police corps which started , you know , finding other breeds to use because this thing known as a german shepherd here , its personality and its dependability and its reliability was just terrible . 
so about fifteen years ago the german shepherd club of america decided amongst themselves that they were going to change this . 
so they went back to europe and brought back some good examples of each of the three breeds 
and it's the alsatian that's the kid's dog . 
it's just , 
you see them in europe 
and they're just lovely . 
but you'll see , 
this is bred for , 
and they had to go through and destroy for a while there , about seventyfive percent of their puppies that they bred . 
because they were looking for this disposition . 
and nowadays you'll get a dog trainer to recommend a specific , you know , breeder handler . 
they will recommend their shepherds as a children's dog . 
but  . . . 
well , i'll start off being controversial . 
i'm in favor of it . 
that doesn't necessarily mean you're controversial .
but , uh , i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime . particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now . 
well , i think that those crimes which are punishable by the death sentence , need to be reevaluated . 
i think there are other crimes that could easily draw the death penalty and not make me feel bad at all . 
i think , uh , 
crimes against children is one of them . 
oh , definitely . 
any crimes against person ,
actually , i would like to see the system revert a lot back to some of the forms of punishment that exist in middle eastern countries . 
if you steal , you lose a hand . 
oh , yeah . 
that's a , 
you know , uh , if you kill , you lose your life . 
what's wrong with that ? 
i don't see a thing wrong with that . 
i believe that , uh , 
i think there's , uh , someone that's on trial right now 
and they were interviewing the , the , 
a young lady was killed sometime back ,
well , how do you feel about this ? 
and , you know  ,
and they want the person punished and punished ,
deciding what that proper punishment is , is one thing . 
i think that there should be no way , i realize that innocent people could go to , uh , what is it , lethal injection now . 
innocent people could do that , 
but for every innocent person who would be executed , hopefully there would be ten guilty . 
to maintain a prison inma , 
that's right . 
that's stupid . 
and , well , the problem there is they're not keeping the right ones in prison in many cases . 
there are more ,
or this individual was out on the streets ,
well , i don't have solutions to the problems , 
but you know you have these , 
this would be nice 
and there's probably thousands of holes in that theory , 
i think then that a life sentence to restitution is appropriate . 
i think he should spend the rest of his life working to support that individual 
people who kill policemen . 
here again , anytime anyone goes out with a gun in their hand and crime on their mind 
that's right . 
now i'm not in favor of gun control to the   degree or anything because , uh , there are uses for guns which are noncriminal 
 but it seems that the criminal element are the ones that are using them . uh , aside from domestic disputes , husbands shooting wives or vice versa . 
but these individuals , if they have a gun with them , i think that the sentence should be even longer than if they don't . 
i don't agree with the length ,
i think expediency is the answer . 
that's right . 
there should be some , uh , 
i know there's a law , i believe , that it's automatic appeal if it's a death sentence . 
well , i think that automatic appeal ought to take place , uh , within a reasonable length of time , say six months .
and a decision be made and not drag out in the courts for years ,
that's right , 
technical , 
i think that there should be a statute of limitations on appeals . 
there's got to be a , 
you can appeal it once . 
i think if it is appealed one time and the appeal is turned down or the sentence stands , then you might be allowed one more appeal if it is , 
a legit , 
that's right . 
those are the things that have caused them to drag out i think . 
that's right . 
well , one of the sad things is that so many of these never actually come to trial because of the process in which the criminals were apprehended . 
i mean , uh , you know the guy is guilty . 
you know he's done what he's done . 
you may have stood there and seen it . 
but because he wasn't read his rights whenever he was arrested , you know , 
he didn't see his ,
and i realize that that is designed to protect the innocent . 
it's also designed to line the pockets of lawyers . 
oh , yes .
and , uh , i just don't think that , 
i think we could get along a lot better in our criminal justice system if we had .
i hope you're not a lawyer .
i'm an accountant 
and i agree . 
we practice law ourselves because it's too expensive to hire lawyers ,
that's why you check books out from the library . 
 there you go . 
but i really believe that our justice system is the best around 
but it's not perfect , 
and that doesn't mean that you leave it in tact . *[[in tact intact
well , a legal system which the criminals have found a way to use and a way to benefit them rather than the public itself . 
that's right . 
that's right . 
that's right . 
but you have to continue , uh , to protect the innocent you're giving an open door to the guilty . 
that's right . 
and , it , 
i don't know there just seems to be so many clever ways to avoid the real intent of the law by following the letter . 
and that just , 
that really does ruffle my feathers ,
i mean i can just get so ,
but , you know , it's going to take smarter people than me to solve the problem .
and i hope ,
well , uh , if you had to pick a type of music that you like , would you be able to ? *[[functions as a qw
as i've gotten older , i've started listening more to the words of music 
not originally . 
where you from ? 
georgia . 
okay , well , see 
i'm from chicago , 
so  , uh , i'm kind of in a different category here . uh , 
if you had to pick one , what would you choose ? 
uh , i would probably go with , 
it's tough , uh , i think i would just stick with the classics . only because , uh , i like music just for music's sake 
and  , uh , you know , i'm from the era where , you know , we had all the rock and roll . 
i'm forty 
so i'm , you know , part of that whole deal 
and , uh , that was a real interesting time 
and , you know , the music sort of made the whole time very rich with sound . 
uh , but i think i'd stick back with my beethoven and my bach and my mozart .
i mean because it's just , 
it will always be there . 
it's classic 
and i don't have to worry about , you know , what's current and what's not because i haven't been current with music for a long time . 
but , you know , same , uh , 
and , as far as country music is , i've never really , uh , listened to it . 
i mean because that's just , 
it was , 
it wasn't part of what i knew , 
so , there you go .
well , i understand what you're saying . 
i think if you would listen to it a little , you would discover that it has a lot of roots that we both lived through . 
it's a different perspective on everything , too . 
 it seems sad to me . 
it's always about some guy losing some girl and then , you know , playing the guitar and singing about it . 
well , there's some joy in it also . 
but , mostly it just tells a story about life . 
well , i must say , though , uh , i listen to amy grant . 
do you consider her country ? 
i don't know . 
uh , uh , let's see . well , name some people that are country that i should listen to .
that would be good . 
well , uh , i like groups like the statler brothers .
oh , okay , 
 yeah , they're fantastic , 
so , uh , uh , 
reba mcintire is a little too country for me . 
she's something , though . 
she's got so much energy .
that's true . 
well , i guess i have listened in on some of the stuff and not really realized it that i do like some of that . 
uh , dolly parton , she's kind of , 
is she kind of country ? 
oh , yes . 
that's certainly where her roots are . 
right down there . 
uh , uh , how about the oak ridge boys . 
very much . 
well , i like them , too . 
so i guess i've had a smattering 
and i just , uh , you know , picked , 
i've picked up a little bit along the way that i probably wouldn't have if i'd stayed up north , you know . 
that's true . 
 you know , so , well , i think there's music all around anyway . 
i mean , i think life is just music , 
so , you know , you can hear it wherever you want 
i've kind of shied away from some of the new stuff because i just don't understand it . 
but maybe twenty years from now they'll look at it as classic rock and roll which i really like 
well , it's just difficult for me to believe that anybody's ever going to make a record of the rap songs of the eighties . 
the greatest hits , 
so , i mean , if it stands the test of time , we'll see . 
that's true . 
and , uh , then it'll , 
can you believe this sort of thing , 
but , uh , you know , i think of , 
i get real tickled when i listen to some of these old beatle , uh , music , you know , the orchestration of it and that it's so popular still 
rock stations call it classic soft rock , you know .
but we used to listen to it full blast .
of course . 
so , it's kind of funny the way we listened to the stuff , 
but , i don't know . 
well , you got any more ? 
well , the big key is that , i think you've already stated , that all music is rooted in the classics 
and it has grown from there . 
well , that's , 
well , it was great . 
you bet . 
how many children do you have ? 
i have four . 
oh , four , 
how many do you have ? 
well , i have two children and , uh , two stepdaughters . 
 so we have four altogether , too . 
are you running ragged these days ? 
well , no , 
oh , they are . 
relate now to my grandchildren . 
oh , well 
i do keep my , 
impart me some wisdom , catherine .
 uh , i do take care of my youngest granddaughter , uh , most every saturday . 
uh , my daughter and her husband work saturdays . 
my daughter is , uh , uh , doing a schedule of , uh , twentyfour hours on the weekend , 
but she gets paid for forty . 
and dave is , uh , in supervisory work 
and he has to work almost every saturday 
how old is your granddaughter ? 
she's three . 
oh , so she's a little one . 
are you surviving . 
is she child ? 
oh , no , 
she was a miracle baby . 
was she ? 
oh , that's nice . 
now do your other grandchildren live in the dallas area ? 
do you get to see them ? 
how nice . 
what a treat . 
you know , being from plano , you know , i know so very few people who have extended family in town . 
i'm real jealous when i hear that somebody has a grandma around 
that's really wonderful . 
it is , 
and , you know , just so that they get to know their grandparents , but also for help .
we don't have that luxury . 
but , we have lots of friends , 
and everybody tends to be in the same boat . 
so we trade off a whole lot with friends and , you know , run here and run there . 
we're right smack dab in the middle of baseball season right now . 
and we have three playing baseball . 
oh , that's marvelous . 
well they keep you hopping , i'm sure . 
they definitely do . 
well , i know , uh , that , uh , one of the ladies i know , they are very involved with their little girl 
and i think it's excellent because she's getting qualified quality time 
 and , uh , i think because she is , uh , the only child that they concentrate , uh , they would like to have more , 
but that hasn't been , uh , possible . 
and , uh , she's tried many , uh , avenues 
and she devotes , 
and they're focusing on all of her , uh , welfare . 
well , our kids , you know , 
uh , my daughter uh , sings with younger generation , i don't know if you've ever heard of them . 
there they're a singing group here in plano . 
oh , okay . 
and they're part of the civic chorus . 
and they're going to washington , d . c . next december . h , to sing for president bush at the white house at christmas time . 
oh , how wonderful . 
isn't that neat ? 
that's wonderful . 
well , that's wonderful . 
it is . 
so , you know , and then she plays softball 
and my son plays baseball 
and my stepdaughter plays softball 
so we tend to do a lot of running . 
things are very different nowadays than when i grew up 
oh , they are . 
 and i'm sure when your children grew up you didn't , you know , 
i don't remember doing all these things . 
i certainly don't remember my parents running me here and there and supporting me in all these things , 
but we had more , i guess family time alone 
now i think 
it can be 
you know , i kind of long for the good old days when 
it wasn't so he , 
but on the other hand , we just love watching the kids play and getting to know the other parents 
you have to look on that , on the , uh , positive side of that . 
it's just different . 
it is . 
it's just a different lifestyle . 
it's just very different . 
my , uh , second grandson is in a cappella 
and i know what you're talking about when he's involved , you know , the children are involved 
and he's been , 
he has traveled 
and they have won awards , 
so i 
oh , really . 
and , i know where you're coming from 
 and it's very nice . 
i think , uh , uh , those type of children , uh , that are involved in things like that , their , uh , goals are going to be set higher than the average child that are not participating in things . 
well , i think so , 
going to , 
and , uh , 
a team effort , 
and so i've been real pleased with that , too . 
i think they've learned some real good life skills . uh , you know , being 
and , uh , 
that's really is 
and , uh , there's less , uh , friction involved in relationships when you add that skill 
and , uh , i mean a lot of people that are adults are having to go back and learn those basics when our children are already learning that . 
and i think it's a a giant step of progress , i really do . 
so , uh , i , 
give me some wonderful advice catherine . 
what is the best advice of mothering that you know ? .
the best of ,
oh , that's good , that's real good advice . 
and , uh , keep your mind off of negative things . 
and keep your mind on positive things 
and stress that to your children . 
and , uh , even if they're discouraged , tell them that that's just a passing moment 
 and , i think you'll see a lot of growth uh , in their ability to , uh , control their thought pattern 
and when you employ the word of god there's nothing as powerful as the word of god . 
well , i would agree with that . 
we're also real active in our church 
and my kids do an awful lot with that . 
allyson sings in the choir . 
and you need to return that back . 
oh , absolutely . 
that's right . 
and you owe that 
i'm real proud of her . 
i'm equally proud of her when i see her in church as i am when i see her performing . 
you know , that's , that's real neat . 
well , if she looks , 
uh , do you work outside the home ? 
do you ? 
have you ? 
uh , no , 
well , yes i do . 
in fact , i am at work right now . 
uh , i think what is really important , uh , 
of course , salary is very important , because that's why you are working for the money , but , job satisfaction to me is also , uh , very important in having a job . 
uh , i'm assuming that you are married and have a husband that supports you . 
and so what would you like to see increased 
like , uh , perhaps , uh , he has , uh , 
how important you think that would be . 
just as important as salary is . 
because of course , if you did not have them , you would be pulling from your salary , of course . 
especially when you have a family , with children , and you are always going to the doctor for , 
and they always have surprises for you . 
with children , 
they always do . 
you know , and so , it is , uh , 
we could not do without the benefit package whether they be a conglomerate or just a small , uh , uh , business . 
i think even if your insurance policy is not the greatest . 
you would still have something . 
  you would not be pulling it out of your account all of the time 
also , for working women 
they are getting a handle on that , in fact , uh , my oldest daughter uh , is uh , a nurse 
and she just received her masters degree 
and she is now into consulting 
and that's one of the areas that she is working on . to have , uh , uh , a day care center for of the nurses that are staffing the facility . 
and that is true in many , many areas of , you know , uh , job titles 
it would , 
and it would be just , 
 and they would not have the quality , 
basically be me working to pay for them to be at a day care ,
 and they , 
i understand that totally .
besides which , it would be easier , uh , there's a lot of single mothers out there now , from divorces and a lot of ,
oh , i  hear   , 
that's true . 
and to go to work , you are worried about your child , besides which you have to get up earlier to take the child to day care . 
and if they were in the same building 
and you could go for your lunch hour down and visit with your child ,
do you , 
do you think that would be ,
i think tha , 
i do too . 
i think if the company could not provide it all on their own ,
that you , 
that's right . 
but it would still probably be cheaper  ,
with the company than , 
that's    , 
that's right . 
i think it would be really .
that would be fair . 
i do . 
uh , and how do you feel about , uh , let's see , eye care ? 
eye care is good . 
i do not , 
i am not sur , 
i do not think we have that on our policy . 
but , uh , we , 
vision , i guess it's called ,
it would be great , i mean , uh , the glasses that , 
the exams themselves are not expensive , it's the glasses . 
that's true . 
if you have an   optometrist or an ophthalmologist ,
now like my  . . . 
well , like my mother , she has to go for testing cause she has got , 
well , she does not have it , 
oh , okay , 
her eyes are changing , 
and she has to be tested periodically . 
they are . 
now , i think your insurance covers her 
but you know , for something like that , that's just as bad as a medical , you know , 
that's critical , because she's in need of it so often . 
and , you know , we have , uh , needs in our life that are unique to us 
i mean , we are all different 
now , i would like to see better dental insurance to me . 
well , no 
so , that's it 
that's okay , 
that phone is ringing to an empty desk 
and she's on vacation , 
 so , it's okay . 
but , with the three children 
that's very expensive . 
because on a lot of the dental insurance , they do not cover that well . 
for the orthodontia stuff . 
that's true . 
orthodontic work is terribly expensive . 
it is . 
especially when you have a lot of problems with the children teeth ,
i know , two of my daughters had to have that 
and they started having extractions at age eight , uh , because they just had too many teeth for their size mouth . 
and we footed the bill , because there was not any such thing when they were young . 
my middle child needs to have , uh , orthodontic , because his , his pallet is squared , not rounded .
oh , uhhuh . 
and it affects his speech a little bit , not anything , you know , 
but just enough that his bite is off a little bit 
and it's like four hundred dollars , 
and my insurance is only going to cover like fifty of it . 
well , i tell you in our publication at texas instruments , where they are breaking the jaw and , 
it's less painful and less expensive . 
that sounds like it would hurt more . 
i know , 
but it's , uh , easier on the patient in the long run ,
oh , gosh . 
do that ,
that would kill me . 
do you have any personal feelings on uh , the subject ? 
well , uh , capital punishment is a hard thing , 
but , uh , there's been several , 
there have been several things that have happened where i felt like if i had been involved in it i would have had to the people . 
there have been some things , you know , 
there's things done that are just  , 
so outrageous . 
i know , 
that i do not know how , 
i do not really there's any other way to deal with it . 
well and having them go right back the day they get out , back in crime .
i think that that , 
i have a real problem ,
i think so . 
is basically set up in lawyers 
and anybody ,
they are the ones with the rights . 
they have the right to , uh , you know , 
i think i watched something last week , uh ,    , i am sorry , the accused has the right to a speedy trial . 
but , the victim 
so , now the accused can ask for delays and extensions 
whatever they call them , you know . 
and meanwhile , the witnesses ,
and there's no one to face them . 
they can get continuances on for years , before the thing ever comes to trial 
and that makes the victim suffer ,
the    , 
that too . 
i think uh , you know , that there needs to be a way that , you know , once someone you know , a trial , i do not know how to fix it . 
i mean , it just seems like there should be a limit on how many appeals can be made . 
you know , when someone has been , 
a time limit too . 
when someone ha , 
well , even when someone has been convicted 
and , i mean , it's just so abundantly clear that they did it . 
but appealing , you know , and continuing to appeal , like four or five or six times . 
to have convictions overturned 
and then they have to be retried and all that . 
it's such a waste of time and energy and money . 
and it just , 
that's what keeps , 
that's what is keeping all you know , the criminals in a position of being able to be released all the time , like this . 
do you feel like there's any certain type of crime that this should be the results , they should be consequences of capital punishment , 
or , 
like in a robbery situation , trying to hold up a store and getting scared and , you know , firing a gun and accidently killing someone . 
okay , i could see that that might be the situation where , uh , the person could be rehabilitated . 
but , i think just out and out murder , and i am talking about , uh , cutting people up 
and how do you feel about murders of law officers or fire people or something that are , because they have had them , they have had them killed when they have , 
 well , what bothers me , 
that bothers me a great deal , 
i had a friend who was a police officer , who was killed in the line of duty . 
um , um , um . 
and the thing that was the worst about it is that uh , two of these individuals were , well all of the individuals involved were very young . 
one was technically a minor , 
and they had told their teachers that i mean , 
repeatedly during high school , they had told their teachers that they were .
that was what they had told their ,
and so that's what they did .
and , uh , they were given , i think , 
that would be premeditated .
oh , absolutely . 
he stopped them for routine traffic violation 
and they 
several things happened that night 
but they beat him up and took his gun and shot him 
uh , uh , uh . 
and it was really terrible . 
i mean , uh , i had seen him like three or days before that . 
we had gone out , uh , with he and his wife 
and that was really disturbing  ,
and these people , you know , with all these , you know , things about well , you know , they were disadvantaged and all this stuff . 
well , nobody is that disadvantaged .
well , that's right , 
there's no reason , 
 and there's just no rea , i mean , 
i do not care if you are poor or if you are rich or if you are ,
i think so too . 
and that's , uh , 
so , i do feel strongly about . 
and all these kids , they have got an excuse for everything . 
and i can see it continuing on when they are adults . 
i just , 
it's , it's , uh , 
i sometimes think if i were on a jury and had to make the decision could i . 
and i like to think i could , like you , 
if especially violent crime ,
the thing that even though juries sometimes make the decision 
and still the people , nothing ever happens to them . 
and they go right back and do it again . 
do you work ? 
i think that's the main change . 
what do you think ? 
well , i think that's a big part of it 
and i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home 
that's right . 
but yeah , i think that's a big change .
i'd like to not work . 
what about you ? 
well , i've worked all the time up until just about a year ago . 
and i just , 
physically i wasn't able to 
and i mean , i love my job . 
but i have four children , 
and that's real hard . 
you have children ? 
i assume so . 
and that's been a big deciding factor because i mean i never wanted to be a career woman , 
 but as long as i as much as i could ,
and i wanted to stay home when i had kids . 
well , i have two . 
i have a four year old and a three year old . 
and we would like two more 
but i , 
it's like , we talked . uh , i don't want two more unless i can quit and stay home and take care ,
it's real hard . 
i mean even i , 
it's full time work . 
it was so hard for me to work full time . 
of course , my kids are a little older 
but then you give up the money . 
you know ? 
you do there's sa , 
of course , you know , everything you give up something 
but i just , 
the kids are so wonderful .
 but i do think that's one of the major changes . you know , 
my mama i remember her being home 
i know . 
 and if she worked it was part time 
and it was work that was done while we were maybe at school , 
and she was there when we got home . 
 you know , and , 
 well , i've decided now in fact , afar cry from my travel agent career ,
 but i'm there in the same school as my children , my two littler ones . 
and i'm home when they are home . 
in fact , i've had an offer to just work the christmas season at a local jewelry store , 
and i'm just really hesitating ,
i mean , well , i didn't have babies or day care working as a travel agent 
and it was wonderful . 
my kids and i , we just had a ball . 
and i think , 
of course , their ages , they are almost seventeen 
 and we are just running every direction 
 but see , it's such an important time to be home .
it is . 
 and that , 
you know , my husband was raised , uh , 
his parents were divorced when he was young so his mom always worked , 
always worked . 
what , yeah . 
well , as our kids are getting older , you know , he sees it more . 
and i want to be able to do those things 
i think that , you know , it's good . 
you know , sometimes i'll have the cookies ready when they ,
and a lot of my boys , uh , my older boys' junior high friends will come over . 
in fact , everyday ,
and it's wonderful .
i'm real close to the schools 
and , you know , we are just 
i'm very happy to be staying home . 
i think that's wonderful . 
but again i miss ,
 so , where do you see , 
i don't . 
i  keep on working  .
and i see it go anywhere . 
i think they are still going to have to work . 
that we are because it's so expensive . 
if we want , uh , extra clothes , the extra car , the extra , 
the thing is , when a woman does work , then there is the clothes to buy , 
 and then there is the gas , 
 and then there is the lunches and then the day care . 
the day care eats , 
  you must pay for   , 
day care . 
you know , i pay four hundred fifty to five hundred fifty ,
for two . 
they would eat you ,
it's almost hardly worth it for you , 
i know . 
then you work summers unless you are a teacher . 
are you a teacher ? 
 and i would love , 
you talked about having the summers off 
 and i love the little preschool they are in . 
it's wonderful . 
you know , so i feel good about them being there 
but it's still not the same . 
it's not the same . 
i don't see things changing really , 
and it's terrible for divorced women 
thank goodness i have mine , 
please come back to work . 
  and we'll pay you this  .
and it's been a real tough decision 
but i'm very happy to be here with my kids . 
my kids , we've seen a remarkable difference in ,
that's wonderful . 
that's wonderful . 
i'm real , 
and i'm , 
but i've been doing a lot of volunteering at the schools and playing lots of tennis .
i like that . 
 i know  .
well , we're working on it . 
i'm hoping in about three to five years i'll be able to stay home 
and my kids , of course , will be in school then 
but i'll ,
  right  .
i feel like ,
 and i can work part days in my husband's business , you know , so that ,
 oh , that would be great . 
i think that has changed for woman because we are working is we are having less children . 
 was famous when they executed somebody . 
gary gilmore . 
gary gilmore . 
by firing squad , as i recall . 
that's right , 
and we still have a death penalty . 
a gentleman , uh , that was one of the hifi murderers just had his conviction overturned , well , appealed again . 
i guess we have the longest , uh , running inmates for death row too . 
and then we had another guy , uh , ronald lafferty , that thought god told him to kill his sisterinlaw . 
he just got a new trial because ,
uh , how do you feel about the death penalty ? 
 well , i , yo , you know , 
until recently i've been sort of , 
could go either way , you know , 
it , sort of doesn't much , you know , 
it didn't , 
it wasn't a strong issue , um , i guess it still isn't a strong issue . 
but i must say , i find it very silly , the way politicians are running around 
i assume they're doing it for that reason .
well , i'm sure that's   .
well , i kind of agree with terrorism . 
i think those guys should be done away with . 
that's one of the worst ,
and , uh , drug dealing , um , 
but , uh , 
 it's not enough just to lock them up forever . 
uh , no , 
it's got to be something that is going to cost them , because we never lock anybody up forever . 
we've got these guys in new york that , uh , i'm sure you heard about , the ones that killed , uh , the gentleman that came from utah to watch the tennis 
and i guess they got convicted , the four , of 
 so you've come to a definite opinion on it now ? 
well , i , 
 gotten carried away , 
um , and know where to draw a line , 
i mean , and incarcerating them for a long time , if that could be improved upon , that would have more impact , i think . 
you kind of hate to , 
a more serious capital crime ? 
i mean , murder , um , because that one at least , you might escape from because his victim , you know , his witnesses will be gone .
doesn't this encourage ,
you mean 
yeah , i mean , doesn't this encourage murder , in order to wipe out the 
the witnesses ? 
well , maybe it would . 
uh , i kind of have a problem with our legal system at the moment , uh , as it is . 
i think that people who , uh , infringe on other people's rights , uh , and screw up their whole lives with rape , uh , child molesting , uh , terrorism , just uh , 
there's just like five things that i think they ought to be snuffed for , 
but i'm for it for certain reasons . 
and i think that things like rape , uh , you can't get over , uh , it takes a lifetime . 
i see , 
if william kennedy smith had been found guilty , you believe he should have been , uh , executed ? 
a six person jury could have decided either way , of course .
if it was , it would probably have to be a pattern . 
you know , we have plenty of convicted guys that go into jail and come back out , do the same thing and go back , 
and , uh , if they're habitual , like three times caught for rape or child molesting 
well , the   problem is that they've just been let out of jail . 
if they've been thrice convicted , they should have been kept in longer . 
but we don't seem to keep them long enough , 
and then they learn such bad things in jail . 
that isn't 
that's for sure . 
uh , let's see , 
what's the laws there in d c ? 
when was the last time you went ? 
the last time i went camping was about , uh , in the middle of october , 
and we went up to lake bonham and really enjoyed it . 
had a real good time with the family . 
we do an awful lot of camping . 
how about yourself ? 
well , i haven't been in probably about three years . 
and the last time we went was in , um , well , i guess it was like hunting season , 
and we went down to like a hunting ground and a lake 
yes , oh , 
very good . 
i bet it's pretty over there . 
it is real pretty . 
um , let's see . 
what do you think , what kind of 
do you do a lot of fishing ? 
do you go out , 
and is camping for you in a motor home , or a trailer , 
or do you actually put up a tent 
one of the ones that you pull along 
oh , okay , 
so you have , 
 and is it popup ? 
what do you have ? 
we have a tent . 
and we really enjoy that . 
uh , one thing , uh , i've done all sorts of camping . 
i've camped , uh , in the snow on a glacier . 
i've camped , uh , basically almost anywhere , even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that camping trip and had to pack it back out . 
so you're a serious camper . 
well , we enjoy it , yeah . 
but since i've been married and with a family , uh , we have to go where there's restrooms .
well , that makes sense . 
so , we really enjoy it . 
but also while i was growing up , we did have a trailer , 
and , uh , i camped in that trailer and in a tent and in log cabins and so forth too . 
so a lot of different things . 
and yes , 
to answer your questions earlier , yes , we do enjoy fishing , 
and i do go fishing . 
haven't done a whole lot down here . 
we recently moved from the rocky mountain area up in , uh , northern utah down to here because of work , and , uh , haven't been able to enjoy fishing like i used to up there , which is , uh , clear water fishing and streams and rivers . 
but when you all went camping is that what you normally , i mean , 
what did you normally do ? 
we normally , yeah , 
we did a lot of the fishing , 
but mainly what we did was we did a lot of hiking and exploring and just going out and seeing what there was to see , uh , in the area . 
i guess probably just wherever you live at has a lot to do with what you're going to do when you go , 
and you do actually camp . 
oh , yes . 
that's true , 
did you ever like travel around to what's that , the little k o a camps whenever 
ever done that ? 
although i've stayed in k o a campgrounds , uh , we've never done that just to go around and camp . 
um , personally , when we were growing up and when we were going camping , i thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground . 
um , you know , that was mainly for people in motor homes and so on and so forth , where , you know , we really wanted to go camping in a tent 
 and , uh , k o a is geared for the people that have a hookup . 
that actually travel , what , city to city , state to state . 
and , uh , i started out basically camping when i was in boy scouts , 
and we did an awful lot of that as a boy scout group . 
as i mentioned earlier , we went into wilderness areas 
and we camped in the snow , and in , uh , snow caves , 
and , uh , 
that's probably where i first started , was in girl scouts . 
all right . 
what do you like to do when you go camping ? 
um , well , let's see . i mean , i just like to go 
and , normally i go with a whole group of friends 
 and we just kind of go and hang out and just do fun stuff . 
roast marshmallows . 
tell scary , or scary stories around the fire 
or , um , take a deck of cards if we can actually see and , um , play cards and stuff . 
 oh , yeah . 
don't you , uh , get bored and not have anything to do , 
but i've found out that actually we really enjoy getting away from the television , the telephone 
it's relaxing . 
 and , yes . 
get out , 
getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping . 
plus , you , um , 
kind of makes you appreciate a lot of the things you take for granted . 
running water 
running water 
your hair dryer 
and a private bathroom . 
curling iron . 
what about your family . 
do your kids and everything like to ? 
and like i mentioned , uh , we've been camping a couple of times this year 
and the last time was in october 
and we went up to lake bonham , 
and there was a playground for them 
so they had swings , 
i'm carol , 
and i'm calling from garland , texas . 
this is   
i'm in dallas . 
oh , okay . 
okay , um , 
let me see , i think we've only planned one family reunion in our life , 
um , most of my family's in california , 
but my husband's is in san antonio , 
and so we did this in san antonio , 
and , um , it was an experience that i won't do again .
how big a family do you have ? 
um , well , it wasn't that big of a family , 
but , um , it just got out of hand , 
and , um , so many people were coming that we were trying to figure out how much food we were going to need and , um , how much , um , beverages we were going to need and this and that , 
and oh , it just grew and grew and grew , 
and , um , when the time came , only about half that amount of people came . 
so , it wasn't , you know , 
you have to really just get an accurate amount , 
but overall we all had a good time . 
we saw people we hadn't see in a while 
did you have people coming from far away ? 
well sometimes . 
but it just kept growing and growing and growing and growing , 
well you have 
the family lives too close together , they see each other too often 
and if , uh 
i think you're right . 
my family's not very big 
but , uh , we're kind of . 
your family's from where ? 
well , i have a brother lives in indianapolis , a sister lives in chicago , and my folks live back in buffalo , new york . 
oh , no . 
uh , i guess we have reunions about once a year or so . 
we got together over christmas . 
my wife's family , they're all in , 
most of them are in upstate new york . 
they have uh , regular family reunions every summer . 
oh , those are nice . 
it is . 
and i'm sure they're a lot more organized too , because they've done it before . 
and they plan on doing every summer . 
they just have 
that's great . 
and every year everyone asks 
 and they just plan on being here . 
that makes a big difference , too . 
i know everybody's real eager to participate . 
well that's great . 
uh , well , for my motherinlaw at her seventyfifth birthday ,
and they managed to get just about everybody into town , uh , last november 
so uh 
one the whole shebang 
more people want to come back again . 
that's good . 
so , so that works pretty well that way . 
uh , my grandmother in california is , um , 
this is my dad's side of the family is planning a reunion , um , this spring , 
but we won't be going because , um , i don't know how they thought of this , it's going to be on a cruise , 
and , um , it seems like most of the family is , uh , going , you know , all the nieces and all the grandchildren and all that are , most of them are going , 
but it's too costly for us . 
and , um , it sounds really neat , it really does . 
i can go for that . 
what do , 
i guess interesting if you had 
uh , i don't know how you would go about , uh , getting them together , 
but that would be , uh . 
and a friend of mine , um , she plans her family reunion , um , every year , 
and they go camping , 
and she says they have the greatest time , 
and she says , usually everybody shows up in exception to maybe one person , 
but she said they all go camping , 
and they have a really good   for the whole weekend . 
so , that's . 
i kind of wonder what kind of tradition we're going to establish for our family . 
i had hoped that our kids get together at least regularly . 
right now we only have two children 
so i , 
what are your favorite t v shows ? 
uh , i guess one of my favorite ones is cheers . 
i always liked that one . 
they're always so funny . 
those are probably my two favorites . 
i rather enjoy the cosby show . 
my wife and i both like commish . 
you know , i've watched that one time 
and it was really good , 
but now that's on , what , saturday night ? 
it's either tonight or tomorrow night . 
uh , around here at least . 
i guess 
i can't , 
i saw it one time 
and i really liked it , 
but i just haven't , uh , you know , watched it since . 
uh , we always enjoyed it . 
it seems to be kind of halfway between , uh , something like all in the family and , uh , hill street blues . 
i , i , i , 
it's a good show . 
the episode that i watched , uh , i liked him because even though he's a law enforcement officer , you know , sometimes 
you t , 
and he seems to do that sometimes .
he's tender hearted fellow . 
i think that's what first drew us to him , the relationship between he and his wife kind of looks a lot like ours . 
but , uh , 
i thought it was a pretty good show . 
i always like , 
i like to watch like sixty minutes and twenty twenty . 
uh , i know uh , we watch commish any chance we get . 
uh , used to be a big fan of star trek , 
but that's kind of , th , th , 
it's gotten more and more to where they are so totally against , uh , anything spiritual . 
but , uh , anyway , 
i've never gotten into the star trek era .
used to be a real big fan of star trek . 
uh , pretty much , yeah . 
i always enjoyed the show anyway .
and star trek's in a s , or the , uh , star wars set 
 uh , one of the first star wars movie ? 
i think i watched it like nineteen times . 
oh , my goodness . 
you must have some of their lines memorized .
uh , i did at one time .
read a lot of science fiction work , too . 
but , uh , no , 
it , uh , 
we don't do a whole lot of t v watching , 
but uh , i don't know if you heard them or not , i got a twelve year old , twelve week old baby . 
i imagine 
between him and school , there's not much time left for 
well , we're expecting our first in about three months , 
so i know we won't be watching as much as we do now .
this one here is our first . 
and we're both full time students 
oh , wow . 
that must be tough . 
it doesn't matter , just a healthy baby . 
but we told him not to tell us , 
i mean , it's like finding out somewhere in july what you're going to get for christmas . 
i mean , you know , 
it's not 
i agree .
i'm sure we'll be watching more , uh , children oriented television shows . 
oh , i'm about half kid at heart anyway . 
oh , i am , too . 
i , i , 
i still watch cartoons sometimes , every once in a while  , when my sister comes to visit 
the new cartoons don't seem to be worth much , 
but the , uh , 
well , a couple of the , uh , ones disney's doing aren't too bad 
well , you know , it seems like a lot of them are a lot more violent than they used to be . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , i remember , like , the flintstones and the jetsons 
the worst of the violence in the flintstones was when somebody gave fred a poke in the snoot . 
but , oh , shoot , i mean , blowing up galaxies 
and they wonder why kids turn out the way they do nowadays .
everything's mutations 
what was it feature at the theatre . 
those old little ten minute jobs where , uh , the real ballooned looking art work , you know 
a , and , 
oh , so what would be your favorite meal to cook ? 
none to cook . 
i don't like to cook .
i make a mean spaghetti . 
uh , got kids ? 
 so what about yours ? 
well , my wife and i and we've got a thirteen week old baby 
uh , yeah 
we don't , 
let's see , a good dinner party 
think you , 
i suppose it would just about depend on who was coming , i guess . 
you know , uh , something light and easy . 
if it was pretty informal 
breast  of chicken  .
oh , gosh , 
how do you usually cook your deer ? 
on the grill , we'll take the back strap and soak it in italian dressing for a couple of hours 
and it is good . 
i imagine . 
real good . 
either that or hamburgers , we really don't have dinner parties . 
i understand . 
we just had , uh , deer stew sort of 
uh , some veggies in it . 
did you kill 
no . 
i mean , i get close to the woods with anything resembling a weapon 
and suddenly there isn't a deer within fifty miles . 
so , no , 
uh , guy was uh , in a hunting club 
 and , you know , 
but the whole group goes out hunting 
and then at the end of the day , they split it 
 and whoever brought it down gets the lion's share 
and the rest of it is split with the rest , with everybody in the group . 
oh , well , that's nice . 
well , he wou , 
they went out last year and almost everybody got it , the limit 
 so everybody had deer coming out their ears . 
we still got some from last year . 
they gave us some deer 
and some of it's still in the freezer 
and they , 
about eight months ago they gave it to us . 
we either crock pot deer 
or we'll , uh , you know , put it out on the grill so that , uh 
we h , 
we usually have most of it made into , uh , hamburger meat , though .
that is good . 
i think if i was going to have a dinner party , i'd probably have , uh , sandwiches or something along those lines and 
oh , well , anyway .
usually it's ,
let's see , what did we have the last time we had guests over . 
we had uh , a turkey loaf . 
which , uh , kind of taco turkey loaf . 
it was good . 
uh , scalloped potatoes . 
mashed potatoes . 
mashed potatoes with , uh , cheese melted over the top of them . 
a couple things like that . 
it was pretty good  little  dinner . 
usually it's k , 
this isn't a good topic for me right now . 
i'm on a diet .
oh , don't you hate that ? 
i got a few pounds to lose myself . 
that's okay . 
i've been fighting my weight since i was about ten years old . 
i have , too . 
i was real skinny till i was ten . 
i left the fourth grade weighing about a hundred pounds and started the seventh grade , grade at two , 
how you doing , howard ? 
well , let's talk about air pollution . 
what do you think causes air pollution in dallas ? 
or where are you from ? 
maybe you're not in dallas . 
i'm from the , uh , 
i'm from dallas . 
i'm in richardson . 
okay . uh , 
what do you think as far as air pollution in the dallas area ? 
well , i have some small experience in this area . 
the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown 
but , uh , one of the major problems that dallas has is oxides and nitrogen . 
that's because of all the equipment that's being operated . but at the same time , uh , because we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we ,
now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas . 
uh , power plants since , 
many of our local power plants , uh , are natural gas most of the time , uh , the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide , and n o x . 
there's no particulates in natural gas , of course . 
and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products . 
we're burning fuel oil and a few other things , 
but gasoline , of course , now the lead's out , at least theoretically , uh , i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur . 
that's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter 
oh , really ? 
and that's , uh , course hydrogen sulfide , which is when you burn gasoline , you also produce some water vapor 
and under the right condition you get h two s . 
but , anyway , uh , 
well , you are well versed on the subject , i tell you . 
well , i don't know . 
this is not one of my better ones . 
that's where i see most of it . 
uh , ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is . 
and when they run rich they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons , 
and that's another part of the problem . 
the gas is not being burned completely . 
but , uh , hopefully , if we ever get our road system fixed up , this will get a lot better . 
oh , i don't know , i've lived here since seventyfour , howard , 
and , i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here , 
and i think they'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone . 
well , i guess , not trying to top you , but i grew up in dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of north central which was built after the south part of 
and , uh , i can remember coming over the hill down there long about , uh , i don't know , little bit north of over those hills 
course , it was designed for most of us to go about fortyfive miles an hour because the short on ramps and off ramps , 
seems like , uh , those ramps might kill us yet . 
hopefully the new ones will be a lot better . 
i understand . 
i sure hope so , i tell you . 
you know , you get out on the , uh , interstate highways versus , 
i travel quite a bit 
and traveling from , like , dallas to austin to san antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles you're at your best 
and , i guess when you're out on the interstate , heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars 
ron , have you noticed when you're driving south on thirtyfive , i guess towards waxahachie , hillsborough on down to austin ,
right along in there somewhere , suddenly the air feels cleaner . 
have you noticed that ? 
well , sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing 
 but , uh , i also travel a little bit 
and , uh , i don't know , it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier . 
it may be all in my mind . 
oh , i know . 
i know going to , uh , uh , 
i detest going to houston because it's such a , 
mike , i'm calling from dallas , from richardson . 
oh , okay , great . 
i'm in addison here . 
well , good . 
 and , quite honestly , with the exception of being involved in a part ownership of a little bass boat , i have never really got into sailing or boating . 
i do , uh , quite a bit of sailing . 
i own a sailboat that i 
oh , do you , well , great . 
and we take it out 
and we do some teaching of sailing with the scouts , 
well , that's neat . 
it's just 
so it's hard for me to get it somewhere 
i've seen some nice , nice sailboats . 
the guy that used to live next to us in richardson before we moved twelve years ago , or whatever , he had a sailboat , used to park it right in the , uh , driveway 
and it seemed , uh , 
i think it held probably , uh , 
it must have slept four people anyway . 
this one is not that big . 
it's a day sailer . 
it does have a little kind of cabin thing that you can store things in 
 but you couldn't really sleep in there unless you sort of stuck your body out the hole ,
they can be black holes to throw money into .
i tell you ,
boats are kind of expensive to maintain . 
and , you know , we have a swimming pool at our house 
and i think of all the time , now that my kids are gone and away and married and going to college or whatever , that i put in there , i just could not imagine a boat because i know it's a lot of maintenance . 
especially a bigger one . 
oh , gosh 
the bigger 
you bet . 
a sailboat at least doesn't have an engine to mess up , 
but you still have to 
it takes a , a pretty good amount of maintenance to keep one up 
you bet . 
i know , my wife and i were first married here 
aunt and uncle , 
aunt and uncle up in new york , they kept a boat on jamaica bay 
and we used to go out with them and back then they had bought an older chris craft 
and we were involved every weekend in just , uh , 
as we visited , we were involved every weekend in just helping them redo this and refinish that . 
we just worked all the time . 
but their boat slept about four people plus had a little kitchen . 
it was sort of neat . 
but i think that was the last time we were really involved , 
and that was twenty years ago , or twentyfive 
and when you work hard and you're under pressure and everything all week long , a boat can be a lot of relaxation , uh , especially with a group of friends and 
you bet . 
but it's , uh  , 
i visited my cousin a couple of years ago , my wife and i 
and our daughter and he had a place on lake of the ozarks 
and he had a boat 
and , uh , i never seen so many boats in all my life . 
people actually park their car when they get to their place they're staying , townhouse or condominium , whatever they own
use the boat 
i mean they go , 
if they want to go to the lounge to have a cocktail , they use the boat . 
they just go across the boat and tie it up and go in , huh 
and that was sort of neat . 
that's true , that's exactly how they do it . 
they go to dinner that way , go to all the restaurants 
and that was sort of a neat setup . 
i enjoyed that . 
we spent a week with them . 
i'm envious , 
that would be fun . 
and , uh , 
i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat . 
uh , once i get my son into and through with college , he's going to be starting , uh , rice next year 
so he's going off , 
but uh , once i get to that stage where i'm not paying for something else 
you bet . 
i might just donate my little one to the scout troop and let them ,
you think you'd really enjoy it ? 
uh , the sailing part of it i like because it's so quiet . 
and if you get a big enough one , then you've got a little motor on it also , where if it's light wind , you can still putt around a little bit and have fun . 
oh i , 
 or if the wind dies , you're not stuck in the ,
with my little one , i've been out there many times 
that's great . 
and you're just stranded out there trying to pick up what little gusts you can to work your way back in 
oh , i know . 
and if you're a big enough boat to have the little auxiliary motor on there , at least you can kind of drop the sails and 
and putt putt . 
well , that's neat . 
 but it's fun . 
where do you work ? 
who are you with ? 
i own an insurance agency , a managing general , a wholesaler of insurance , uh 
well , good . 
and , uh , i'm a scout leader , though , 
so i'm out with , 
so you have a son ? 
uh , he's thirtyseven 
and i don't know if he's ever going to have any or not , 
but i do have some neighbor kids , lots of little neighbor kids . 
i go out and , uh , i play ball with them . 
you know , it's , because like this one that lives right next door , her mother does some work at home 
 and it just seems like she doesn't have any time for her . which is kind of sad , you know . 
so the kids are kind of hungry for someone to play with them . 
so i will go out and play catch with them or you know , let the dogs outside 
and they will roll around on the ground and play with the dogs 
but , uh , actually i do think that the parents should have , you know , a little bit more time to spend with their kids . 
i would think so . 
when you , 
when your son was at home did you , uh , working ? 
did you work 
or were you able to stay at home with him ? 
and then he went to a baby sitter that this lady had about five other kids that she baby sat , you know 
 but we always had our days off together 
and we went camping on vacations . 
so we had a lot of time together that way you know . 
well when my mom , uh , 
when i was growing up my mom worked too , 
but she worked nights 
and so she was always home for us 
 and i always , you know , when i came home from school and when i worked , 
but now when i look back at it , it must have been a really difficult thing that she did 
oh yeah . 
well i am sure it was , you know . 
but , uh , i don't know what the families are going to come to now days because there just doesn't seem like they do have time for their kids . 
because most of them , the father and mother both work , you know . 
so , it's really rough . 
uh , i have one neighbor uh , the father is a fireman 
and he works like four days on 
and it seems like he is suppose to come home for like three or four days , 
but he can't make enough as a fireman to support his family , you know . 
so , he's got a second job . 
so you know he's not home very often . 
and that's , you know , 
the kids i know miss that . 
they really do . 
uh , a family without a father , it's , uh a really hard thing . 
yeah , you know 
and i don't know , 
but , uh , 
kids , i think would much rather have dad there than the toy anyway . 
 oh , i am sure they would you know . 
so , are you planning on , having any children 
oh yeah . 
 but we are , 
we just got married like , like december ,
so we are going to wait a year . 
um . yeah . 
 well that's good . 
that's what my uh , daughterinlaw told me . that they were going to have kids probably after two years of marriage . 
and they will be married nine years  ,
so , i don't know . 
she's a nurse , you know 
and , uh , she has brothers and sisters that has got lots of little kids , 
so maybe they just decided that , uh , if they wanted to have kids around the house they would just you know call one of their sisters or brothers up and tell them to send the kids over for the night . 
that's a possibility . 
 but , uh , 
 well , we really want to have a family . 
we feel like that couple you know , you are not giving enough of yourself 
give them an edge , 
but , we feel like the first year needs to be devoted to , uh , making the family , the couple strong 
 but then , a family is definitely a high priority . 
uh , do you plan on staying home after you have your children 
or do you work or what ? 
well , well i am in a different situation . 
i am a missionary 
 and i am home on furlough . 
it called , like 
i have worked for four years in africa 
and i come home for a year . 
and then we go back for four years . 
but my husband and i will do the same job 
and we will be living in africa 
and we will be working together . 
so , uh , we will share the job of raising the family . 
i mean as a mother i will have certain responsibilities that he might not necessarily have 
but , still we will share that job . 
but we have , 
 or do you send them away to boarding school 
and if you do that when do you do it 
and that's a , 
do you play ? 
how about you ? 
uh , i'm not as good as i'd like to be 
but it's a , 
is anybody ? 
uh , i'd started playing when i was in elementary school actually . 
we lived 
and i'd go up there with friends after school a couple of times every week 
and then 
oh , wow . 
and then i'd started picking it up again a couple of years back 
and i've really been enjoying it . 
that's kind of the way i did it too actually . 
i played , uh , just a tiny bit when i was real young 
and then , uh , i got on to a team in high school but wasn't very good still .
and recently i picked it up , like you say , about a couple of years ago 
and , uh , i've been playing , you know , off and on when i can . 
up in minneapolis it's not too easy to play in the winter of course 
 but i actually live in florida 
so , uh 
the one factor that really bothers me is the expense of playing golf . 
i was going to say .
i mean it's a great game 
but i mean to play a really nice course , you've got to have a really big wallet  , i mean . 
that's true , all too many times . 
fortunately , uh , down where i live in florida , there's some golf courses that are pretty reasonable if you know where to look . 
uh , one of them is the university of florida golf course 
and that's pretty good . 
i , uh , attend the indiana university 
and it's the same way here . 
they have a really nice championship style course that 
can you get like a student discount type of thing 
i mean you'd think you would 
 but , uh , you don't 
so . i , 
what are green fees run there ? 
uh , well they range anywhere from about five bucks for your basic city type course up to fifty , sixty dollars for a really , really nice course . 
that's about the same i guess as it is in florida .
my dad is a member of a golf club over in my home town 
and i can play for free there 
and it's a pretty nice course . 
oh , that's super . 
and i guess    , well it's free for me .
somebody's paying 
but not me . 
well , that's the way to do it though . 
that's the way to get in some good practice without having to pay for it all the time .
as far as watching golf , i mean , i can watch it on t v 
but it's kind of boring . 
it's nice to see those    , guys . 
they have such good style that , uh 
they need to get a new photography method . 
because once the guy hits the ball and they got to try to follow the ball 
i mean , it , they do a generally okay job 
but like you said , it's kind of boring actually . 
 what i really , 
i , uh , had a chance , 
they had the p g a tournament up in indianapolis last year 
oh , yeah ? 
 and i was able to go and see one of the rounds of that 
and that was really fun . 
 i mean you knew it 
i bet that would be   .
i never really thought it would be that much fun to go to a big golf tournament and watch 
but , man , it was something else just to follow those guys around and actually watch them play . 
i've never been to a tournament . 
but , uh , that's wild though . 
i'll have to see if i can't get a chance 
  you got  
 i mean watching it on t v . 
and if you pick a group of golfers and follow them around , i mean , it's just , watching them the whole time instead of like on t v , you get to see them make a tee shot 
 and then they go off to some other hole 
and they come back when they're putting , 
but , you know , it's really something else . 
i can imagine . 
  what do you do for a living ? 
uh , i'm a student right now . 
oh , you are ? 
uh , which university ? 
at , uh , indiana university . 
all right , great . 
what are you going into ? 
uh , i don't really know . 
i'm a math computer science major right now . 
i wi , 
it'd be nice to be a pro golfer . 
i mean , it seems like that would be an okay life just to hang out 
if you're good , you can really rake in the bucks . 
what was 
there was a movie about a professional golfer 
and i 
it was on network t v a couple of times . 
oh , yeah ? 
well , you know , it seems like , well you go to work every weekend . play , maybe , one , two tournaments a month . you come in about tenth , you'd still 
that's right .   .
that's a good thing . 
but , uh , yeah . 
i guess when i get back , i'm going to school in florida actually . 
uh , and , fortunately , i've been able to play some golf on a student budget which is 
but , it's unfortunate , you know . 
you hear about japan .
and those fees to join a club . 
like a million dollars or whatever is just 
that is out of control . 
 , really be liking your golf . 
i guess they have those , uh , driving ranges that are actually stacked one on top of the other . 
 , i saw one of those on t v . 
that is pretty wild . 
   . eah . 
in gainesville , as a matter of fact . 
and it was really wild . 
they were into it . 
you know , they kicked our butt all the way to , 
do you work with a company that , uh , gives drug testing  ? 
i'm a student 
but , uh , 
and they do a little bit of drug testing . 
oh , they do ? 
what , uh , 
did they do that before you went in or what ? 
and , occasionally they'll have a random urinalysis . 
well , i've , 
i worked , 
i don't work right now because my company i worked for , p i e , went bankrupt 
 but , uh , they was getting a program set up , that for all new hires they was going drug , uh , give them drug tests . 
but , uh , they didn't hire very many new hires because all the people that usually work there , you know , just stayed there because they had been there for a long , long time . 
but , uh , actually , i think they should do it . 
i believe they should too . 
you know , uh , i don't think anybody needs anybody to be working for them that's on drugs 
but , uh , i don't know whether i believe that they should just randomly do it . 
but after you , 
you have ,
well , i suppose you are right there too , you know . 
uh , personally i , 
i know when i was doing my , uh , basic training in a i t 
and then when that urinalysis came around they would be all scared . 
the only problem is , you know , if you have done drugs but you've stopped and , uh , you do get caught , it is kind of harsh . 
or what do they do with you guys if , that you guys get , 
uh , we get counseling 
and , uh , i think part of our pay is docked if we're 
i really don't , 
i haven't , 
i don't do any drugs 
so i don't know . 
well i don't either . 
i wouldn't even think about it .
i think anybody that does them are dumb , you know . 
 , really . 
you're so stupid ,  god  
and you just watch it on t v and see how it just burns your brain completely up , you know . 
you don't , 
wastes your future . 
but , uh , . et's see , what else was i going to say here . 
uh , what do you think about our , uh , like , uh , other government agencies testing ? 
do you think our government agencies should test ? 
i think they all should test really 
uh , it just seems like there is so much more of it going on anymore 
but i think that the government should do something about stopping it completely . 
about it coming into our country . 
you know , they just slap somebody's little hand , 
oh , i know , 
  they aren't  .
and they're right back at it again . 
right now it's too lucrative for the drug dealers 
but , uh , other than that , why , i don't know . 
like i say , maybe one of these days i'll get a job because i am looking still for a parttime job , you know , since my company went bankrupt 
but , like i say , i don't even smoke 
i wonder   if you take medicine if that would effect it . 
oh see , that's , 
it is a problem . 
sometimes some medicines will give off a false positive . 
i've heard of that , 
  i believe you should have the testing
but they should be , like , if you get a positive , they should double check you and still give you the benefit of a doubt . 
find out you know , if you have been taking some kind of medication and , you know , if that would effect it and everything . 
well , it was nice talking to you rose . 
okay , lewis , 
and maybe i'll talk to you again . 
we keep a monthly budget . 
i just recently stopped working so i can be home with my kids 
and we try to stick to it .
 i know . 
it's really difficult here . all because there's always something breaking . 
car needs tires or you know , something . 
that's the kind of things that throw you off . 
uh , uh , we do ours more monthly than long range . 
uh , we , uh , 
my husband gets paid once a month 
 and when he gets paid , i pay all the bills .
and out of his check they take a savings 
and out of my check , they take savings 
so , as far as extra savings , we really don't have that much extra to save . 
uh , his check , once a month , pays all the bills . 
my check , weekly , buys groceries and gas and 
oh , how nice . 
 and it works out real well that way . 
we don't run into a lot of problems 
we do , 
my husband gets paid twice a week 
and so we pay all of the little bills , uh , one 
and then , again , he does have a savings that comes out , you know , for christmas and stuff , that kind of thing . 
that kind of thing . 
  uh , it would be nice if we didn't have to touch the money he has taken out and put in savings 
but we do . 
 but it's nice that it's there , you know . 
i'm just glad that it is there for 
 but , uh , 
i know . 
but i , 
it's just really is difficult . 
uh , neither one of us has had a raise in a couple of years . 
and , of course , the cost of living keeps going up so much . 
groceries are outrageous 
that's kind of how i felt when i was working because it seemed like we spent more . 
we bought more things 
then a lot of it was going to , uh , daycare and that kind of thing . 
so it just seems like with me staying home , we had that big cut 
but we save more .
i don't know how 
and i don't know why 
but we 
it seems like we do . 
you kind of try and buy bigger quantities . 
and i'll stop by the deli and pick up , uh , chicken or whatever . where if i did not work , i'm sure that the grocery bill could be managed a lot , uh , better . 
that's how i felt too . 
it just , 
you could take a little longer . and 
 well , y , 
i guess that's kind of like the way we do . 
i don't know how it comes out . 
it just seems like we save a little bit more whereas ,
 well , i'm sure you do . 
uh , well i do not have to pay child care during the winter . 
my son's old enough that he likes to come home 
but in the summer he's still young enough that i cannot leave him by himself . 
so in the summer i have that extra 
and ours is seventy dollars a week plus all activities 
 and that's usually movies one day , skating one day .
swimming one day .
it adds up . 
so you usually end up paying close to eighty dollars a week 
and that's a lot of money . 
it is .
 but you know , if they're going to be in daycare then they need to have some activities other than just being there . 
do you have two children ? 
one is four and a half 
and the other one's two and a half , 
well they're expensive too . uh , just the 
so i'm sure the budget , 
i just came back to find jeans for the little one
and it does add up . 
 but , uh , 
and medical bill . 
although the insurance we had was good , uh , when thomas was younger . a lot of the stuff had to be paid up front 
and then you were reimbursed . 
so it was nice when you'd get a couple of hundred dollar check from the , 
but in the meantime you had to put out the money first . 
 . but , 
 well , that's hard . 
it is . 
 but i'm enjoying my stay home for the little time that i can .
oh , i would too . 
for the , 
i know it's not forever 
and that's what's so sad 
well , you probably wouldn't want to do it forever . 
i don't know though .
 well , we just got our income tax return 
and i'm perfectly happy . 
what about you  ? 
well , let's see . 
i haven't got mine yet because my parents are getting all that stuff uh , at home 
so , i'm not sure how much i'm getting back 
but i'm pretty sure i should get back a little bit since   student , 
it's not too much . 
not too bad though .
but as far as writing checks out and paying taxes , i think it's pretty high . 
but i , i'm , you know , 
although it is kind of a pain sometimes though . 
how high are the taxes going to be when my children are my age ? 
you know , that's scary too . 
because it's not anything like the way it was when i was young and small and a child . 
so , you know , that's a scary part too , that you have to think about . 
 and  , 
and because we were   increasingly complex society that 
and , you know , taxes are one of the ways to help pay for a lot of the things that are needed in this society . 
i mean , everything uh , to , you know , feeding the homeless , to maintaining prisons , to maintaining polices or fire departments and things like that . 
and it's , 
now there's more and more things that need attending to and that sort of thing . 
and , you know 
but someone has to pay for it 
and that's us . 
and then you find out about all these things about is your money going to where you want it to go 
and . there's going to a special this week . 
i can't if it's twenty twenty or one of those things where , 
uh , i think it's one of the local news . 
i think they're having a documentary . something about that . 
about their trying to catch some people that  , not spending your tax monies right and fraud and that kind of thing , you know 
and that's kind of scary too .
and , uh , so that would be interesting to see .
i wanted to see that program . 
even today it's like the   amount of taxes that , you know , we're paying for . 
but you'd think that we're  still in   , that 
we're still not able to pay off things just because 
you know , it's like fifty percent of everything you make is already gone before you even get it . 
and that's kind of a scary thought . 
i hope it doesn't come down to that . 
but , on the other hand , while those countries that have high taxes , also have things like , uh , socialized medicine , things like that too , which are nice fringe benefits of it . 
so everyone has the access to medical facilities as well as the doctors . that sort of thing . 
and it's good 
but it's the price they pay .
 i mean it can be argued one way or another whether economically it's actually good for the country or good for any given country to have that because those countries tend to have a much slower cash flow 
well you sure do know a lot .
well , just keeping up with the times , that's all . 
one of those  interests   , you know , i kind of like to keep up on . 
because , well it's nice to know that when you know , i do start working that , i like to know where my tax dollars are going too . 
  work hard to get , you know . 
that's true . 
what do you think about these items that are going to be , uh , taxed even more . like , uh , tobacco and that kind of thing .
i think in a way it's good , in a way it's not . 
uh , but i think in general it's probably good . 
i mean , a lot of things like tobacco and alcohol and things like that against 
and they're a proven health hazard to smokers 
and it's , 
and so if you walk into any restaurant or any hotel there's no smoking allowed anywhere . 
oh , really .
uh , i just currently quit my job 
and so .
but my husband does 
and , uh , i think one of the , uh , my , 
first of all , always salary and se , 
the second thing is , uh , because we have children , 
so it would be , uh , health benefits and medical benefits 
we have with aetna 
and , uh , i don't know if you're familiar with them 
but we're real happy with them . 
i've had a variety of different jobs with various types , uh , in the computer field . 
and so i've seen a variety of types of benefits . 
uh , i've worked   for awhile 
and they are , you know , a really academic type of place . 
and then i've worked with regular , you know , industry type places . and then with others that are kind of half way between and stuff . 
so i've seen a wide range of both , you know , nonsalary type benefits and other stuff , you know , like health care that's either fully or partially paid 
and , you know , some have like bonuses
and others have had lots of vacation time but not much other types of benefits 
i'd say health care is way up there , especially anybody with kids . 
and does the company pay for it . you know , all or partially 
or how does that work . 
and , uh , also , uh , vacation time too is a big one for me . 
uh , cause i've 
so that's not so bad , you know . 
you know , it's kind of a give and take kind of thing , i think . 
uh , i say that health care is probably definitely number one though . 
  want to just , you know , all your salary can't even begin 
uh , and another good thing is with the health benefits when they give you more than two choices on who to go with . 
and that really helped us out a great deal .
but my husband does get vacation 
and it's worked out really good for us too . 
flexible hours are pretty important to me as well . 
uh , cause that makes a big difference .
my wife works parttime . 
and she works , uh , as a assistant manager in a fabric store . 
and so she works a lot of evenings and weekends
and so two days a week , i , uh , manage to get home early enough to meet the kids on the bus .
so she you know , goes in early those days and works like , you know , noon til close .
uh , so we have   .
 well , that's great that you all can work that out . 
and being on a , you know , rigid schedule there wouldn't be anyway to do that at all . 
and i think it's kind of neat to be able to spend the afternoons with the kids occasionally too . 
i mean usually , you know , you go to work before they're awake or as they're getting , up for school 
and you get home 
and it's already dark unless it's summer time , you know . 
and even in summer time , sometimes you get home so late that you know , you can't do anything with them . 
and especially in the winter . i mean , you get up in the dark and come home in the dark you know . 
it's like a vampire  sometimes  .
it's the same with my husband cause he's got pretty flexible hours as long as he puts in the hours he needs to do   .
worked out really well for us too . 
uh . well is there anything else that you look for 
 uh , a lot of   i guess is . 
you've hit pretty , 
you've put a lot of the main points in . 
i think some of , is how the , uh , you know , 
i guess it's not really a direct benefit but how your , uh , performance is rated and stuff like that at work . 
cause i've been , uh , 
especially in large corporations . you can really , you know , wind up having , you know , real problems i've found out . 
i've worked for a few , you know , several thousand plus , you know , type companies .
if you're , 
like i've , 
i work with , uh , computer systems a lot . 
so it's kind of hard to say , you know . 
and they were all straight 
and your building didn't fall down , you know .
you did a great job . 
but if you build computer systems , like , well , you know , what does that computer program really do , you know . or , especially if you write like papers , you know . 
it's real hard to rate something like that . 
it's like get a painter , you know , or something , a artist . 
it's like well   how do you really rate , you know , michelangelo , you know .
how would you tell if he was , you know , really good or soso or whatever .
and that does make a person want to stay  , 
an interesting topic . 
the , uh , type of cars that uh , i would be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a , uh , mazda miata . 
uh , the , uh , 
i'm very much a fan of sports cars . 
 the , uh , 
uh , uh , though , actually , in som , 
actually if i h , 
i have av , 
i've avoided buying a new car for quite some time .
i'd rather put my money into , uh , 
i have a old triumph t r six . 
and , uh , uh , so , uh , 
but if i was to buy one , probably something like a miata . 
it's certainly , 
i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time .
oh , really . 
what's the , 
how old is your car ? 
uh , well uh , eightyfive c r x . 
uh , which is , you know , it's , 
it still works fine .
but actually , it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to replace it .
but , uh , 
so what do the miatas run ? 
they're about , uh , uh , thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and , you know , a bit more if you add some some options and so on 
 well , that's not too bad . 
uh , yeah , 
that's a pretty good price 
i've never driven one . 
uh , uh , it's nice . 
i've been down to a dealer and driven them . 
and i've also driven one at in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of , uh , cones to see who can get through the fastest . 
uh , you know , about a minute or so .
and oh , it handles so nicely . 
and so you've done this ? 
it was just , 
 it's just so smooth 
nice car . 
what are you interested in ? 
you don't get involved in , uh , car decisions ? 
that was my husband . 
he wanted a van 
and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there . t v , you know , the whole bit . 
but i never drove it 
i can understand . 
 and then , 
 they're nice . 
 because i'm with the kids all the time . 
oh , yeah . 
it's not , 
it's small enough that it's easy to drive . 
holds a lot . 
and the whole parking lot's full of minivans .
but , you know , i drive a little subaru . 
 and , uh , i love that . 
we were going to trade that in for the van 
but i just wanted to hold on to it cause i just really enjoy that . 
and , uh , that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back . 
 minivans are nice . 
i have a friend who has a minivan . 
and , uh , i've driven it a few times 
and , uh , it's nice , 
of course , you know , always had a v w bus every since , uh 
oh , really .
oh , really . 
uh , uh , 
they , well , 
he used it , 
he often has to transport plants or , uh , things 
or   .
it's amazing what a minivan can do . 
we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan .
the popup trailer ? 
and , uh , it's , 
and they're not that expensive . 
they're not . 
they're probably   .
mainly because everyone makes them , you know .
you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be . 
and we do a lot of , uh , driving . 
we do a lot of traveling .
and so that's the only time that the , uh , conversion van came in handy . 
but it really didn't cause our kids are still little . 
so , uh , that was the only time we really needed it . 
other than that , it got terrible mileage 
minivans do pretty well .
some of them probably even do thirty . 
the , uh , 
there's some other cars i'd like 
but i would never be willing to send quite that much money for , uh , like , uh , uh , 
i'll drool over them . 
uh , mandatory service . yeah . i don't think it's a good idea , uh , 
because we'd have to change the constitution to , uh , allow , uh , involuntary servitude , uh , in service to the government . 
and i'm not sure that we could ,
i like the , 
in what way are you talking about . 
well , i like the idea of voluntary support . 
i mean they might be able to , ah , say that anyone who does that , uh , gets certain benefits that would not be available to someone who didn't do it . 
but to use force , uh , there's a title to your body and that title belongs to the government . 
and you are not a free american 
the idea itself of service is good 
and when someone is say , out of high school and not sure about college or out of college and not ready to go into a career and they're not committed to huge amounts of debt , that's the best time to be able to do work that doesn't pay very well . 
see , i , 
and i also thought that , uh , that would interfere with college work . 
unless it were tied 
 and they didn't , 
you know , if someone were studying something ,   take something obscure . somebody was studying economics , the state department could offer to send them to the soviet union for two years to teach them how to run their country . 
but , in reality , i think what you would wind up with is a political football where they would see all these body counts that they can use for their own will 
and i just don't think it would work . 
when do they assume this is going to be proposed or mandatory ? 
or when , 
what year are they looking at ? 
it's been suggested . 
and it's sort of a topic of debate . 
every time it comes up it gets voted down . 
the people who are promilitary oppose because they don't want people to have the right to opt out of the military into something else . 
and the people who are proconstitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless 
so , mostly , it's just kind of one of those things that goes away . 
uh , what age group are they looking at ? 
uh , oh eighteen . 
the draft age . 
eighteen . 
that seems , 
normally that would interfere with college , i would think . 
wait a , 
i moved . 
that's better .
now their , 
they figure that they can draft you at eighteen . 
they usually do draft you at nineteen . 
and that's the ,
oh . um . 
 and , of course , this one the women would be equally grabbed 
and they're almost on the verge of saying that if you're going to draft men , you're going to have to draft women . 
and you're going to have to put them in front of the guns just the same . 
so , uh , if you're near that age or you know somebody who is 
i'm not near that age .
i'm way over it 
but i 
 oh , okay . 
and you don't want them sent off to the middle east to 
 you know , we only find out about that a year after the fact . 
so , it's another thing . 
when in doubt , don't trust the government at all .
it's really reached 
hey , you're in perot country .
i'm really thinking that this guy might be good for us . 
i do too .
i've been , i , 
it seemed dangerous . 
and then i find out that he helped rid the united states of the gablers . 
he's helped out in a lot of ways . 
he's from dallas . 
or he's in the dallas area . 
and , uh , he's very well known around here . 
well , i'm in the computer biz too 
so i know he's well known in the industry . 
they , uh , 
i have high hopes for him . 
and i think that  , you know , if he could get people interested and encouraged and to believe that the government was actually for us , then i'm for him . 
i , i . 
 i mean in the democratic primary , i'm going to vote for brown just because i kind of like brown and his attitude . 
but uh , when it really comes down in the fall , i think i know where it's going to go . 
i think he's got a very good chance . 
so , there's a lot of people here pulling for him . 
so . i don't know .
we'll just see . 
 you know , th , 
did uh , you work in the , uh , computer business , is that what you said ? 
i teach people how to use macintoshes and how to buy equipment and desktop publishing magazine production and things related to that . 
oh , okay . 
uh , my husband works for , uh , texas instruments . 
oh , yeah . 
okay carol . 
is it , 
i know in here , uh , downtown dallas , you can see it . 
but , then again i originally was from california 
and , uh , there is a big difference between texas and california . 
 and , uh 
and , of course , they don't have that here in texas 
so , there's  . . . 
you mean they don't have uh , the smog alerts ? 
we're going there tomorrow . 
oh , really .
 actually , i'm a california born person . 
i was born in l a 
so i know what you're talking about . 
in l a , it's pretty bad . 
oh , okay . 
you do then . 
 uh , the worst city in the world is actually , uh , mexico city . 
is it really ? 
i would not imagine that . 
the worst one for smog is mexico city . 
the most polluted city in the world .
you learn 
i know that they're looking at , uh , uh , you know , uh , you know , better running automobiles . 
i've seen that . 
uh , some things they do , one of them is they're using corn in fuel . 
you ever heard of that ? 
well that's big up here because they grow a lot of corn .
oh , yeah 
 uh , that's one thing that they do .
at that , it's pretty easy to do . 
and the , uh , 
unfortunately , it still contributes to global warming cause , you have to , you know , wipe out forests to grow corn and things like that . 
that's true . 
it doesn't make sense . 
uh , but it's , you know , 
one of the most , uh , productive crop in the world 
and , of course , i doubt if there's any , 
you can buy regular anymore . 
you buy unleaded . 
drive cars with catalytic converters ,
it's interesting . 
they're looking at , 
there's some work being done on , uh , automobiles that are electrical powered .
and , uh , 
but it has a engine in the back 
so the engine kicks on when the batteries need power 
and it turns off . 
interesting thing about any energy .
that is good . 
unlike a car where it's running . 
a electric car it's on demand . 
i mean it's either on or off . 
you don't have to shift .
so you , 
cars become very simple all 
very interesting . 
that would be nice . 
i think i saw that on t v one time . 
maybe it was c n n where they were demonstrating that .
there's a race in australia with solar powered cars . 
and ford and general motors and all those compete . 
 but what , 
i think that was a setback .
that they , 
i don't know , 
they went , i don't know , how many miles an hour .
i think like twen , 
i don't know . 
g m , uh , chrysler announced that they're going to , they're , 
well they actually have an electric minivan . 
their caravan . 
but it costs , uh , fifty thousand dollars right now . 
and they're very expensive too .   .
 to operate , yeah . 
but , you know , people are buying them . 
the power company . 
 you know , free for them . 
 well , yeah . 
 kind of  interesting so see . 
 well , it doesn't make sense . 
because if they want people to convert , you know . 
it's top speed is something like eighty miles an hour . 
 so it's 
um . well i'll tell you .
like today i think it was pretty bad . 
i don't know if it's just , uh , the allergies or what 
and other days it's just really bad , 
so , i don't know . 
so what kinds of things did you experience in l a when you were there ? 
or can you remember ? 
were you there at a ? 
oh , i wasn't there too long ago . uh . 
cause i haven't been there probably  . . . 
well , you know , going over the hills , you know , coming into the valley ? .
you can see that horrible , horrible brown haze . 
well , we were there when they had a  , 
uh , do you have a pet randy ? 
uh , yeah , 
i read somewhere that , the poodles is one of the most intelligent dogs , uh , around . 
well , um , uh , i definitely wouldn't dispute that , 
i became part owner six months ago when we got married , 
but , uh , it , uh , definitely responds uh , to authority 
and , i've had dogs in the past 
and , uh , it seems to , uh , respond real well , 
it , it 
just by , uh , teaching by force , i guess is what i'd like to say . 
oh , uhhuh . 
so , how long did you say . 
well , about a year i guess . 
oh , well , uh , is it , 
uh , uh , how old is the dog ? 
it just turned two , i believe . 
oh , it's still just a pup . 
pretty much , 
i have a , uh , well a mutt , myself . 
i call it a , uh , uh ,  chowperd  .
it's , uh , part chow and part shepherd 
and it , 
as i understand it , uh , both sides of the , were thoroughbreds . 
so , she's a genuine  chowperd  .
oh , that sounds interesting . 
she has tongue of a chow , 
but , uh , she has the shape of the , uh , uh , shepherd . 
oh , that's neat . 
about how big then ? 
oh , she weighs in at about fifty pounds , 
so she's a medium size . 
most definitely . 
and right from day one , she was teaching me .
oh , i wouldn't doubt it , 
she's the most intelligent dog i've ever seen . 
course , i'm a little prejudiced , of course . 
well that's understandable , 
it's , uh , 
 you know , the first time i brought her home , she was only , uh , was it six weeks old . 
and i spread the newspapers out in the kitchen area . 
but , uh , next morning , she let me know in no uncertain terms that she wanted to use the bathroom . 
so , on next night , i spread the newspaper in the bathroom 
and she used them there . 
but it wasn't too long until she , uh , found out she could wait until i let her out in the morning . 
and since then , i live alone , 
and , uh , i live in motor home , 
by the way , i'm , uh , an full time r v er , 
and it's such a pleasure to come home at night 
and you can see her smiling from ear to ear , she's so happy to see me . 
and , uh , i don't know if you get that kind of greeting or not . 
and so now , uh , in order the master bedroom during the day 
and then she's got for free run during the day 
she's definitely ready to get out and run around .
uh , she'd rather the cold ground at night . 
oh wow . 
but , uh , i do make her come in . 
and i feed her indoors , that's to lure her in , 
but during the day i have her uh , on a leash ,
i have a thirty foot cable ,
and then attached to that is a , uh , twelve foot leash , 
so she can cover quite an area . 
most definitely . 
and , uh , she's the best , uh , burglar alarm going . 
that's , uh , definite security involved uh , in a dog like that . 
oh , yeah , 
she , uh , 
it's the strangest thing , though , uh , children , no matter how strange they are , or how new they might be can walk , uh , right up to her , 
but adults , if they're strange to her , or they look suspicious or something , boy she acts like she wants to chew their leg off . 
and i have not discovered yet where the line is between children and adults . 
that's interesting . 
but , uh , she is a great comfort to me . 
i know our dog has had , uh , some different reactions , 
she's never really been around children 
and , uh , is pretty straight forward , um , she's fine . 
and yip and bark quite a bit , 
and if the child gets scared , uh , she's still trying to play , but she doesn't completely understand what's going on 
and we've had a little confusion with , uh , with younger kids . 
but , uh , you know , that's , 
it's a matter of exposure really . 
um , we , uh , took her home to , uh , my family's place in south dakota , 
and she was the one that was intimidated then . 
there was about seven kids ranging from about , uh , three years to ten years running around the house all at one time ,
oh , uhhuh . 
and , the dog she was being fed , and everything else from all directions . 
she really didn't know how to handle herself . 
you mean she didn't appreciate all that attention .
she really did , 
she just , uh , 
with all the attention . 
uh , she kind of sat and   it all in for a little while 
and then she'd go get back in and try to play and what not , 
but , uh , such a new experience for her . 
she's only been around one and sometimes two people at the most 
so , uh . 
what's her name by the way ? 
uh , pardon ? 
oh , it's , uh , mitzi . 
mitzi . 
mine is gin . 
oh , okay . 
as in , uh , martini . 
 actually , it's gin two . 
i see . 
because , uh , when i was a teenager , in high school , i had gin one , 
 but then when i went out in the world , i couldn't take her with me . 
i had , uh , a similar , uh , experience . 
i grew up on a farm 
so i always had , uh , outdoor pets 
and he was a real lovable type ,
oh yeah . 
so uh , he had to stay home . 
it really was . 
he , uh , apparently had a tough time with it for a little while 
and then he came to accept the fact that mom and dad were his company from then on , 
but , uh . 
and i must say it was interesting . 
most definitely . 
i enjoyed talking about pets with you . 
well that's great . 
maybe we'll get together again in the future . 
that sounds real good . 
take care now . 
you too . 
amy , how are you doing today ? 
all right , 
how's that ? 
you go ahead . 
um , i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and we're talking about criminals , 
in public places . 
there is one state that does that , by the way . 
what is that ? 
i want to say oklahoma , 
i saw something the other night about it . 
they don't do them real often .
um , but i think if we quit , uh , building , these taj mahals with the color t v s and on a life sentence , we should start hanging them and get it over with 
and let's just screwing up the system . 
well , the sentences are so unbelievable . 
i just saw on the news last night , that they said the average time a sentenced murderer , you know , is in jail is two years before he's paroled , and a rapists is like six months ,
that's pathetic . 
because they just say there's either no room in the system , you know , in the jails for them 
or , you know , it's just that , it seems like the automatic sentences , if a judge has leeway , on what he's going to , you know , sentence someone for between , you know , two months and fifty years and , you know , what's his whim to decide it should be two months . 
this is true , 
you know , it's crazy . 
 and the way the law reads , uh , if they sentence you to life in prison , then he's available for parole . 
if it's life and a day , then he's not eligible for parole . 
so , what , you know , 
let's quit b s ing with the system . 
well even if it's life , like you say , we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some , you know , joker in there for life . 
we could spend that money , you know , for children that are starving , or twelve million other things would be more useful than that . 
so to me if somebody has life , you know , beyond a reasonable doubt that should be it . 
a life for a life . 
you know particularly for some of these really , i mean , 
there are so many just major , major serial murders ,
it's not just like one instance , or something , it's just , uh , horrifying , some of the murders that go on . 
the old charles manson case . 
i mean the guy 
there's just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that . 
uh , about the issue about sentencing by the judge . 
 my understanding , when there's uh , a verdict 
and it 
for example there's a hung jury here in fort worth , today , in eight to four 
and bam , bam the guy got off . 
uh , he was a veterinarian , and killed two , a father and a son , okay . 
i heard about that on the news . 
let's just go like a regular vote . 
eight to four tells me that there were eight , 
rather than have to retrial the whole thing and spend all the money for people to , uh , you know , go back to court and all the lawyers 
and , i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers you know , a fortune to keep doing that . 
and the victims , you know , the family of these people that have been murdered , they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution . 
because it's not next day they have , the , start the trial , it's x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more . 
i think if it's not a split decision , go with the highest number 
and let's just get on with the program . 
but as far as the sentencing by the judge , i would have to vote against that since there is a jury , because that's what the juries are for is to make the decision . 
uh , what are your feelings ? 
well if i , 
i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge , i believe from florida , 
and she just has , really stiff penalties 
and i saw that a judge that would really make a good impact . 
but likewise , you could have the flip side , and have some judge that was paid off or , you know , had a good old boy network 
or for whatever reasons , you know , politics , just let all kinds of people through 
so , he would have a heck , or she would have a heck of a lot of power , you know , if used wrongly . 
so at least the jury system does something to prevent that , you know , or help it with it anyway . 
i don't know if it prevents it , 
but , seems like the jury system does have it's advantages . 
but i've also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient , you know , 
and i don't know how much they're getting just a jury of their peers , at that point , they're really getting a select group . 
it's not just random people . 
it almost should be the first twelve people that they , you know , have on a list are the ones that are on the jury 
and that's it . 
i get back to price's comment when he , uh , was found guilty he said well he didn't have any blacks , uh , you know , from his neck of the woods . 
he'd have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like he's got his peers or something , 
i mean you're in dallas 
so everybody , 
i can't believe they can , 
uh , like in a murder situations , they look for juries who don't know anything about the system , well or know anything about the occurrence , 
you'd have to be pretty dense , 
you'd either have to be in a cave not to know what's going on , or moving it to lubbock ,
oh , they'd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically . 
this is true , so true . 
well , really , this breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors , i mean , 
what can i say . 
so , you're at the house you're not at the plant . 
i'm at home with two little preschoolers .
my husband works for t i . 
oh , that's good , 
i thought i heard a holler there in the background , 
but i wasn't sure . 
oh yeah , 
i've got the dog and two kids waiting here , 
i'm just locked up in the laundry room .
oh goodness , 
thanks a lot . 
i enjoyed it . 
ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy ? .
well , as a matter of fact , i was thinking about that the other day , 
and , uh , i really don't know the answer ,  , 
uh , i would sort of like to , uh , think about something in the way of , uh , uh , sort of a sporty car but not , you know , a luxury type sporty one . 
but , um , something that still has a lots of amenities and , you know , gadgets and things . 
oh , you do want a lot of that stuff ? 
they come in really handy .
what kind of , uh , things are you going to consider , 
you know , about the , 
well , what do you call them , 
you said amenities ,
amenities . 
but what about , um , their reputation of the company or the price . 
well , of course , i guess , uh , price is always the big consideration , 
it is for me , 
other people ,
 well , that's a big one in my book , 
but , uh , um , i have preferences uh , for some , uh , makers over others , um , 
and i would sort of like to buy american , 
but , you know , i'm not so totally hung up on that , that i wouldn't buy something else , 
how about you ? 
well , um , the last car  we  bought was american because of that reason , 
but  have  not been entirely happy with , uh , several things about the car , 
it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be . 
oh , really ? 
because several things , minor things sort of , 
but still they cost us money , um , that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay , on a car that was that new ,
we bought the car new 
and after , 
um , well , well , well under two years we had to replace the clutch . 
brake pads are  disposable   ,
we know that , 
but i never thought a clutch was disposable .
i wouldn't have thought so either . 
so that was kind of a shock .
to think about when you're trying to make that decision . 
you know , the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars , 
they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like , uh , uh , a mercedes benz , 
they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that , that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable . 
you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a mercedes ,
but then , 
but on the other hand , i guess , too , uh , whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune . 
oh i don't know . 
i've , uh , worked with a couple of people who have owned , uh , various years , uh , 
and , even though they do a lot of the work themself is pretty expensive . 
but for them it's sort of a hobby , too ,
what kind of , 
what brand of car are you thinking about buying 
or  like  what things are you looking at ? 
well , i haven't really gotten that far with it , um , 
i've always sort of liked general motors ,
but , uh , oh , i guess , i really don't know . 
how come   
i've been kind of , um , 
i guess the commercials are getting to me , the toyota commercials , 
and i know that a lot of people hardly had any problems at all . 
i think that's , 
i think they have a really good , uh , quality .
my , uh , daughter has owned two different ones ,
and , uh , you know , we've had some work done on them 
but it's not too bad , 
and the reason , 
one of the reasons we , um , bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years 
and he lived way out in the country 
so he put a lot of miles on it , 
and , you knew it had been through a whole lot , 
and yet , you know , it held up pretty doggone good , 
they seem to be really durable . 
so , i don't know , 
i'm not ready to buy a new car yet , 
but i don't know , to stay with buying something american or if i'm going to go for a little more , what i would consider to be a longterm investment .
and i guess , you know , you always have to think about things like , your gas mileage and stuff like that , you know , 
you  . . . 
oh , it's easy to get gas mileage in this car ,
it gets excellent gas mileage . 
that's one of the big throwing cards for , some of the foreign ones .
i think so . 
well , enjoyed it . 
all righty , 
 uh , i was thinking about whether or not we should have people , uh , be required to do public service for a year or two . 
and i was thinking that you needed to put some waivers in there for the handicapped and also for people that had to stay home and maybe be wage earners for their family , 
or they had somebody at home that was ill that they had to tend to . 
i mean , you can't make it everybody . 
but then you need to make it sure that the rich people can't buy somebody off and maybe send them in their places or get out of it some other way too . 
or it could be like the draft where , you know , before they draft you , uh , you get a physical anyway . 
so when they send you a draft notice and they give you a physical 
and if there's nothing physically wrong with you , then you're drafted . 
it doesn't matter how rich you are . 
that would be good . 
and then we could maybe give physicals to the rest of the family members , 
what did you say ? 
and they all had to pass . 
oh , yeah . 
uh , i thought it a good idea too , though would be to extend this and make people that are accepting public welfare have to do something along this line before they got any money . 
that's true . 
and , uh , if they did this , maybe help them out in their college cost 
and maybe they could pay people for doing this , at least something , 
so they could subsist . 
well that's true . 
america's paying all this money to have other people give , uh , aid to other countries , 
so they could be paying their own people and training their own people at the same time . 
because , actually , or something like that , 
so you're really learning a skill .
and you know all these old people , they would get out of this right . 
all the ones that are already retired . 
so what we could do is take all the retired people that are going around in their big mobile homes and they could do public service all over the country . 
what did you say ? 
i'm just teasing .
i , think , well that's probably the idea , 
i don't know whether the idea is to be within the country , or outside the country . 
well i thought it would be a good idea if maybe you took some of the kids and had them go over to other countries 
and children from their countries came over to ours too , a trade off . 
that would be neat , 
sort of like an exchange program . 
and other than that , i can't think of any other ideas . 
i like the idea of , uh , being , uh , a mandatory thing for welfare . 
course that's what , um , 
that's sort of like what truman had , 
or was it roosevelt , 
i can't remember , um , 
with the big , 
oh with w p a . 
getting people , uh , 
all the make work jobs . 
that was sort of public service in a way all the highways they started building . 
and we're still using those things too . 
what did you say ? 
that's true a lot of them are still out there . 
like all these wonderful highways in west virginia and no one knows why . 
they built lodges before too , like at caddo lake .
caddo lake . 
it's between texas and louisiana , 
it crosses into both of them . 
i've never heard of it . 
well , it's real pretty , 
it's like a swamp . 
you know with all the spanish moss on the trees , it's eerie . 
oh okay , 
real pretty , like a swamp , 
oh yeah . 
i been , uh , 
i don't know , 
where are you from ? 
uh , virginia . 
virginia , 
oh , that's neat , 
oh yeah , 
i didn't even know if they were thinking about it .
there is somebody 
and    , uh , i can't remember who it is 
but there's a really famous , 
i can't remember . 
politicians pushing it , uh 
that proposed it , 
i read something in people about it . 
mitch snider , i don't know who mitch snider is . 
 oh , okay , 
well see that's a d c thing . 
mitch snider is he's said it out here in washington 
but he started um , uh , the movement for creative nonviolence . 
and that was basically a , you know , donate time and money to , uh , help the homeless , 
but , uh . 
gee whiz  , 
how far can you go with that one , 
that would be neat . 
i'd have to basically say my birth . *[[humor
that's probably the best one . 
cleaner ways of burning coal 
because we don't have much coal . 
oh we have a lot of coal .
in virginia . 
but , uh , uh , it's a dirty fuel , that's for sure . 
i'm an electrical engineer here in virginia . 
for t i . 
no . 
i'm in a telecommunications company 
we buy their parts just as much as anybody else . 
but , uh , electronics industry . 
and since , 
i don't know , 
i don't . 
i don't either . 
oh , i don't know . 
oh , i didn't hear about that . 
i'm not t i . 
you don't work for texas instruments . 
oh , okay . 
let's see , one of my friends had a roommate that worked for t i 
oh , oh , that's a neat idea . 
i was saying because i've , 
 and it shouldn't be too good right now anyway , because they've been laying off so many people . 
well i enjoyed talking with you . 
well thanks a bunch , 
we'll talk to you later , 
i'm going to save my two year old from the pile of grapes she's diving into . 
well i'm going to try to   clean up the house after my two children for about an hour see if we can walk around . 
i'll talk to you . 
all right . 
last thing i saw was , um , i think , uh , sleeping with the enemy with julia roberts . 
oh , i hadn't seen that , 
but i've heard that it's real good . 
my husband didn't like it that much . 
i thought it was okay . 
it was a little strange , you know , 
this woman supposedly is , um , being mentally abused by her husband , you know , 
he keeps her pretty much terrorized to stay in the house , 
and she figures out this way um , to leave him secretly . 
you know , she fakes her death kind of thing 
so , are kind of suspenseful , you know , when she realizes he's in the house , you know , after her , 
but , uh , kind of had the feeling along that , uh , 
why didn't she just tell him to straighten up . 
hey look bucko , 
you don't get away with this nonsense .
but anyhow , um , what have you seen ? 
well , last week , as a matter of fact , my children was on spring break 
 and we went to two movies . 
we went to see awakenings 
and we went to see kindergarten cop . 
and i really liked both of them . 
awakening was kind of sad to me . 
it really was , 
and it would be to anyone because , you know , they really don't know that much about it . 
so this is where the people have been kind of w , 
i don't a better word to say than like asleep or in a coma ,
and the drugs let them come back . 
but the drugs didn't work for long , 
and they started having real bad side effects . 
and this is about nineteen sixtyfour , i believe , or something like that , 
and there still hasn't been any , you know , new development in prescribed drugs that can help it . 
but , yeah , 
there , you know , 
it was a big breakthrough , 
but in time , you know , all the side effects started showing . 
well , how bad were the side effects ? 
they actually went back like they were ,
all it was , 
they wasn't mild , you know , 
they was just bad side effects . 
but i really enjoyed it , though . 
well how about kindergarten cop ? 
oh , yeah 
that was just  , 
it was , 
you know , arnold schwarzenegger is getting to be , uh , a bit of a variety actor , you know . 
at first he was just a big muscle man . 
but he's kind of branching out . 
he sure is . 
as a matter of fact , um , sylvester stallone , is that his name ?
i really believe schwarzenegger is really going to be a variety player more so than he is , because he really played the part good . 
you know , he could be this rough , tough guy and then , you know , this substitute teacher . 
it was really good . 
well , there was a movie out , 
it's been on cable , 
i get cable , 
and there's this thing with , uh , danny de vito called twins .
oh , i've seen that . 
i thought that was just great . 
it is , 
isn't it ? 
i even like i mean , some of the original stuff , 
like i like the terminator . 
at first , you know , it was kind of strange , 
but i still like watching him in the terminator .
um , total recall last year i thought was really good , last summer . 
oh , yeah . 
guess it didn't last too long at the box office , 
but i thought it was pretty good . 
i did too , 
i really did . 
i enjoy a lot of movies . 
now as far as , let's say , heavy violence , i can't handle .
i'm not into that , you know , 
i ju , 
like rambo and all that . 
that's just something i just don't want to watch . 
and i have some , 
one person at work i know gets really into those goofy horror flicks 
and i told her when she had her little girl . 
you shouldn't be watching them with your little girl , 
and she says her little girl's into it now . 
oh , my goodness . 
and she watches these really gross things you know , like ,
oh , uhhuh . 
i don't go for that at all . 
i guess i'm a little too scary for that . 
i remember when i was real little , we all went to some kind of scary movie , 
and it was like this big house had a basement , 
and there was all these weird things going on in the basement , you know , 
and i was scared to death of our house had a basement for years .
oh , uhhuh . 
and i got a lot of really weird ideas ,
you know , they tell you that kids can , you know , be impressed by all that stuff , 
and it's true . 
it is , 
nobody told me that it was all fake . 
watchi , 
watching , 
oh , i don't want to go home , 
oh , goodness . 
but i think a lot of kids , it's funny , get the same kind of fears , like there's somebody under the bed . 
where do we get that from ? 
i have two children . 
i really try to watch what they watch , 
i really do , because my youngest one , he watches something , you might as well just plan on staying up all night , because you know  ,
mama , i think the ghost is in the house , 
mama , i hear it , 
don't you ? 
they're eight and ten . 
so they're , you know ,   
it's just a movie , you know , 
but no , 
mama , i've seen it .
but i remember , i was with a friend of mine , had , uh , three kids , 
and the little boy must have been , oh , maybe about ten . 
and we rented charlotte's web . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and he didn't want to listen to it . 
he just was beside himself , you know , 
this is supposed to be a nice children's movie , charlotte's web . 
he just couldn't stand it that charlotte was going to die at the end .
die , 
it's funny how your little minds work , 
isn't it ? 
oh , yeah 
she's so nice , 
she can't die .
 oh , it was jus , 
oh , i guess that's why the actors and actresses make millions of dollars , 
people like us , you know .
 oh , goodness . 
well , well i've enjoyed talking to you . 
you too . 
and maybe we'll run across each other again . 
do you ? 
well , as far as , 
um . how weird . 
i don't know , 
oh , uhhuh , 
i don't know a thing about fishing , 
so i'm not even going to try .
but i'm really not for sure , though , if 
well , i'll let you go , 
and we'll talk to you later . 
all right . 
um , have you ever been involved in any trials ? 
it was quite a session that disrupted my whole summer , of course ,
sounds like it . 
but it was an absolutely fascinating experience . 
oh , it sounds like it . 
i haven't had any actual real life experience 
but , uh , my fatherinlaw's been involved in , uh , several trials including , uh , a couple murders . and , uh , you know , talking to other people who have been there 
and so i don't have any real experience with trials 
but i do , you know , 
in college 
and i've , you know , 
try to keep abreast of things . 
but , uh , m , 
i think that the , uh , trial by jury is a great idea at it's inception back two hundred years ago . 
um , right now though to get anything really done as you know you spent , you know , a whole summer on one trial , 
um , there's a lot of things they could do to , uh , make things easier and , uh , you know , like , uh , the suggestion that , uh , maybe uh , a judge should be the one who decides on what the sentence should be rather than the jury . 
well , i think that there are many cases where , uh , the judges probably do make the decision rather than the jury . 
our situation was somewhat different , uh , in view of the fact that , uh , we were a landmark case , 
it was the first time in the state of ohio that , um , d n a testing was entered as evidence . 
and they were being , 
the judge was being especially careful that everything was done correctly so there couldn't be a mistrial of any kind . 
uh , um , uh , the interesting thing was the tremendous selection of jury process , uh , that we experienced . 
that took one full week , uh , to get fortythree people qualified to sit on the jury . 
and then it was a matter of the selection of , uh , twelve people after that . 
actually it was fourteen because we had two alternates . 
and the judge was extremely concerned for our welfare , if we were comfortable , and , uh , things of that nature which made us feel good . 
uh , and we were sequestered 
but the makeup of the jury , uh , was truly uh , you might say a cross section of a country . 
there was one other person besides myself , we were the only ones that had ever been to college . 
um , one was a former student of mine a few years before who was out of work . uh , 
two others were ones who had never finished high school and were out looking for jobs , 
um , a couple of them were housewives who had never worked , 
and then some are people who did work . 
so , we had quite a cross section of black , white and women and men . 
and , uh , uh , it was interesting just to listen to the rationale , uh , being proposed and the logic of some of the people , uh , 
it was also extremely difficult to stay awake sometimes because there was so many witnesses , 
and we were not allowed to take any notes of any kind . 
uh , and i thought that that was a failing because , uh , from the standpoint that it was difficult to try to remember everything , 
and he was right ,
but , uh , i certainly , um , 
i agree . 
uh , would surprise me that , uh , 
when i was in texas i had the , uh , displeasure of getting a , uh , traffic ticket . 
and , um , i went to court 
and you can even get a trial by jury for a traffic ticket . 
you're kidding . 
and money . 
i mean that's extremely expensive . 
i mean , the first thing you had to do when you came before the judge was waive your right to a jury trial . 
i do think that , uh , 
i do think the jury system works 
but of so many people now , uh , 
by the same token we had , um , uh , some people who had vacations planned 
and one man in particular had reservations made , plane tickets made , everything , 
and the judge called and had it all canceled so he could get his money back 
and then he wasn't selected on the jury . 
oh , my god . 
and then another young fellow had to meet with the judge and the prosecutor and the defense attorneys on three different occasions before he was finally excused from the jury because his wife was about to have twins . 
and  in three days to get excused from that jury , to be with his wife on the birth of the twins . 
and , uh , you know , some of it just seemed rather extreme . 
i think they can probably come up with some ways to insure that , uh , you know , people would get a fair trial ,
i mean , some things are just so cut and dry . 
um , and audio tapes 
and you know , they've got ways to nail people  ,
well , i guess  he'd  have to be careful with entrapment or some of those things , 
but , uh , i don't , 
i assume you have seen on television recently , as probably the whole country has , the beating of the man in los angeles . 
oh , that was horrible . 
isn't that terrible ? 
uh , you know , 
that  it   , 
but the fact that it can happen , that it probably does happen in many places , it's horrendous 
and it's just a stroke of luck ,
i know . 
i mean , i only heard portions of that 
but it's absolutely ,
and , you know , if you beat a dog like that , they'll put you ,
well , we get a few other case ,
they wound up paying him , uh , 
the officer , of course , was fired , 
but they paid the defendant , uh , three hundred thousand dollars or something to drop the lawsuit , 
and then last week someone shot and killed the former policeman . 
so , uh ,  as  
some of those things , uh , are absolutely horrendous 
and we do need an overhaul 
and we just need more discipline country wide . 
 it would   , 
then we'd need it on that , 
well , it's been very nice talking with you . 
well , it's been nice talking with you . 
thank you , 
you do the same . 
well , i was just looking around my house and thinking about the painting that i've done . 
and the last time that , um , we tackled it , i did the kitchen . 
and i had gone through a period of depression at one time and painted everything a dark , 
it was called a sassafras , 
it was kind of an orangish brown . 
it was not real pretty . 
anyway , so the kitchen was one of the rooms that got hit with that color . 
i see . 
 so i tried to cover it with white , 
and it was quite a feat getting that dark a color covered , and then just the hassles getting around the cabinets , 
and i did on it because there're splotches . 
but , i'm glad it's done , because it's brighter . 
that's for sure . 
well , we , uh , 
i just got married about six months ago , 
and we bought a house at the same time . 
so we're , 
i'm sitting here in my forty year old house , 
and we're about halfway through the painting process .
oh , lord . 
so , uh , the only , uh , 
i guess the big discussion , just kind of what you were mentioning , has been the color . 
we ended up with a light peach color with , uh , 
and it's got all the old , original hardwood trim and stuff , 
so we've got the trim in uh , kind of an offwhite . 
and this is really the first , uh , interior painting project that i've attacked . 
and , uh , it's been something else , to say the least . 
we had the same type of situation . 
uh , the walls were , uh , uh , 
well , they weren't , 
the color difference wasn't so bad , 
but , uh , there was semigloss underneath 
 and we put a flat over the top , 
and everywhere you'd miss there'd be this little bright spot you could see .
it seems like you could see it through about three layers of paint . 
oh yeah . 
every time the sun would come up in the morning i'd see another spot and have to drag out the paint can . 
but , uh , we've learned . 
we've worked our way back into the hallway , 
and we're in the middle of the bathroom now . 
but , uh , it's been quite an adventure . 
the other thing that makes it , uh , a little more difficult , we've got all hardwood floors , 
and , uh , toothbrush and what not cleaning up . 
so what are you going to get it off with if you get it on and it's dried ? 
well , it's not too bad . 
it , it , uh , 
the floors are finished with a polyurethane , 
we're just using latex , 
and soap and water . 
so , we got pretty lucky on that . 
and it's not scratching your floor ,
oh , that's pretty good . 
we painted every room in this house , some of them like two , three times . 
we have two children . 
and , they just , 
they ruin ,  , 
it's just terrible what they do . 
and then i have been coloring my hair , 
and i'm real haphazard when i do it . 
so i've got dye on my bathroom door . 
oh , gosh . 
and i haven't figured out how to get that off . 
i guess i'll have to take that door down and really get it good . 
probably so . 
and then we have a two story . 
we did the outside of it one summer . 
that was horrendous . 
i mean , i couldn't stand the back side going up that high on the ladder . 
i could get up on the roof and do that . 
i , uh , 
uh , our house was painted as part of the purchase contract , 
so we didn't have to mess with that this time . 
but i grew up on a farm , 
so i've messed with outdoor painting a little bit , uh , 
but most of that , it was done with a sprayer and , uh , up in the bucket of a loader tractor , or something like that , 
so , it took a lot of the hassle out . 
and then 
you know , you're not nearly as concerned with a barn or a grainery , or something like that as you would be with your own house . 
i wouldn't think so .
have you guys tackled your ceilings yet ? 
oh , we got to do that this summer . 
we're dreading it . 
it's like , they're dark . 
everything else is white . 
oh , gosh , 
just the opposite of what everybody's , uh , working towards now . 
now have you thought about this ? that wherever you buy your paint , you need to make sure that that store's not likely to go out of business . 
uh , we stocked up the first time around . 
but we've definitely got all the formulas on file , 
and , uh , they'll be there for a while . 
we're pretty comfortable with that . 
but , yeah , it , 
i open a new can . 
i'm wondering if i shouldn't buy about twenty gallons at one time and keep it all i'm always afraid that the next coat is not going to match . 
but , uh . it's gone pretty well . 
it just , 
it takes some time . 
my problem is , while i , 
i'm not overly proud of it , 
but i'm a selfproclaimed , perfectionist , 
and it takes me a long time to do trim and things like that . 
and i'll find something as i'm going along , something not related , 
they really didn't match . 
they were , 
a few of them were broken and things like that . 
so , i always pick up these little extra tasks as i'm doing this , 
 and the painting actually takes probably , uh , a fourth of the time , 
and i'm always doing all this other stuff , 
and my wife's hollering at me and wondering what else i've come home with from work this time to put in , a ceiling fan or something strange like that . 
so uh , it always , 
you start putting a coat of paint on everything , 
you start to notice where all the dents and scratches and things are everywhere . 
oh , but i still feel good , the minute i put that paint on , even if it does got a dent in it 
i do . 
it sure makes a difference . 
oh , what else can i tell you about painting ? 
oh , and i get it all in my hair , too . 
do you do that ? 
spots in it . 
it's been , uh , 
you know , spend a lot of time working on it , 
and , uh , it was part , you know , 
part of the excitement really hadn't been taken care of very well . 
it was actually , 
it was rented out for a couple of years and things like that . 
so , uh , we ended up getting a fairly good deal on it . 
but , uh , there just isn't enough time , 
that there's a job about half done at home , 
and i really , 
if i'd just stay home and finish it , i'd feel a lot better , 
but , uh , i'm starting to learn that there's always something else . 
once you get done , you can always start over 
and you make up all kinds of excuses . 
are you having to repair the walls at all ? 
a lot of little filling holes and nicks and things like that , 
but , uh , the only , 
the most major things have been , uh , oh , i guess i moved a couple of outlets , and , er , uh , switches i should say . 
for some reason , they put a bathroom light switch in the hallway 
and , uh 
um , that's smart . 
and i didn't like that very well , 
so i moved that , 
but , uh , most of it's in pretty good shape .
so where do you live ? 
uh , live in dallas . 
i'm in garland . 
uh , i hadn't tried . 
you didn't ? 
in fact , we were planting flowers this weekend .
so , uh , i was pretty tied up , 
well , i've never tried any other kinds of painting besides on a surface like the house 
i don't know , 
i can't think of anything else to say about painting . 
that , uh . 
it hurts your back , 
and it hurts your arm . 
you know it .
i get a sore neck from looking up all the time , yeah , things like that 
that pretty much covers my experiences . 
but you're glad you're doing it , 
oh yeah , 
it just , 
it makes such a difference . 
like i say , the overall appearance of this house is what really devalued it so much . 
uh , i don't want to put a price on it , 
but i just feel like every gallon of paint adds a tremendous amount of value to the house . 
you know , the walls are clean , 
and they match , and all those kinds of things . 
do you have one of those straightedge things to put underneath when you're doing the baseboards ? 
and it sometimes doesn't . 
it's a , uh , 
when i start doing trim , it's so hard to tell where an edge is anymore , 
and uh . 
on your baseboards ? 
they y , 
you don't have any carpet down in your house ? 
see , we've got carpet , 
and , i haven't figured out how you're supposed to paint it , on down , so that you won't see where you stopped off 
um , kay . 
because every time you move that edger then it gets the carpet into it . 
well , you know , um . 
you can't hold it there until it's dried . 
i've seen , uh , 
they make some plastic edging stuff that comes in like three foot lengths . 
and , uh , you can tape them together 
and put  . . . 
what do you think about , uh , the way the criminal justice system handles trials ? 
well , you know , they tell you that you get tried by a jury of your peers 
 but , you know , it's pretty hard to try , let's say , the man down the street that's living on social security or somebody that's on a limited income to be tried by a jury of his peers if most of the people , 
like the juries that i've served on , are businessmen . 
now they don't understand that , you know , maybe he needed fifty dollars 
they don't understand that because they have fifty dollars ,
so , you know , i think that a trial by your peers should be exactly that , someone in your own age bracket , 
 you know , you can't really do it ethnically , you know , 
but you could do it , 
but then there's another thing that i disagree with in texas is sometimes you have a jury of six 
and sometimes you have a jury of twelve . 
and i don't know why they do that . 
do you have any reason , 
do you know of any reason why they do that ? 
well , i think the six is called a grand jury 
and that's mostly to decide whether or not the person's actually going to stand trial . 
whether they're acquitted or whether they're actually going to be accused you know , 
i don't know much about the grand jury . 
how do you feel about the , 
in texas i noticed since i've been here , the trial and then the sentencing part of the trial . 
i don't know . 
i think that , uh , 
i know that judges aren't supposed to be crooked . 
well , we know there's a few out there . 
it seems like if you break the sentencing away from the jury and you give it to one person you're letting there be a whole lot more of an opportunity for something to either go wrong 
or for , you know , 
if the judge is not of high moral standards 
would be pretty hard . 
well you know , i don't think that , if i was the criminal , that i would like the judge passing sentence on me . 
if the jury found me guilty , then they should be able to decide at the same time what my punishment should be . 
and i think it's , 
not only that , it's a waste of our money . 
we have to have a trial for this person , 
then two weeks down the road we have to excuse me , set a sentencing date 
and that's more money spent . 
it's not so much that , i haven't seen a lot of really bad sentences passed either by trials or by judges .
someone could be sentenced to thirtyfive years 
and yet , you know , in three years for good behavior . 
and it's not working either . 
it's not . 
it seems that we have more and more repeat offenders . 
i know , 
i don't know how you all are there where you're at , 
but where we're at , now our jails are overcrowded . 
we just built a brand new one two years ago . 
oh , i think they're all overcrowded . 
and it's overcrowded . 
they've , uh , 
so now they start turning them loose . 
i think i heard fort worth that , uh , they've been ordered to do something because their jail is so overcrowded . 
they're not allowed to accept any new inmates . 
now what are they supposed to do ? 
they turn them loose . 
well , no , 
you know . 
well , it seems the way it's been working here's , 
there , yeah , 
something that is working 
and they , 
and they are not allowed , 
i mean , some of them are even allowed to work , 
they can go to their regular job , 
they come home , 
they have to be home by such and such a time , 
they're instructed , uh , so that , this electronic monitor 
and it connects them up to a system where they know their whereabouts .
all right . 
and , uh , they can put a , 
they usually install a video monitor in the house 
and when the parole officer calls to check on them , they're instructed to turn it on and stand in front of it .
all right . 
and that's working rather well . 
that's a good system . 
that allows people ,
instead of being completely penned up . 
and that way it would give , you know , 
the probation department and parole department , they've got to be overloaded with as many criminals as we have here in lubbock . 
oh , yeah , 
at least they don't have to drive all over town trying to find one guy ,
i've really , 
i could go on for hours about the criminal justice system and what i think we ought to do about it . 
sometimes it's pretty messed up , 
isn't it . 
and this may sound cruel , 
but i do not think that they should be allowed cigarettes . 
i mean they're in jail for crying out loud . 
what do they need cigarettes for ? 
well , see 
and there's another thing about the justice system that i don't like 
and there's a lot of people that tell me that maybe my thoughts are wrong . 
i came from california 
 and when you're in jail , they take you out just like they do in alabama or anywhere else , what they call a chain gang . 
and they clean the city parks . 
oh , i think that's a wonderful idea . 
and they clean the city streets . 
but you know , we have criminals in jail that do nothing but sit on their duff all day 
and here it costs us seventeen to eighteen thousand dollars a year to support a prisoner , 
more than that . 
and i know , 
but i know families myself that have three and four children in lubbock that don't make that much . 
i know . 
and you know , they're not doing anything to support themselves ,
the thing that , 
when they get out of jail they get handed all that money . 
that really ticks me off . 
i think that while they are in jail and they are working , their wages 
like , i don't know , 
they could , 
some percentage , like eightyfive percent of their wages should go toward their room and board 
see now   .
and when they get out they should have i don't know , you know , some reasonable amount of money 
but there should be a limit over which it all goes back to the state . 
anything that they've earned while they're in prison should go back to the state except for that , you know , there needs to be some allowance for when someone gets out that they have some money to start with . 
but at least that way they would be helping pay for their own . 
and something else that i would , 
that's the part that i really think we need to change . 
and they're working , 
they're getting paid , 
but the guy that they messed over to get there or they stole something from , or beat to death 
has nothing , 
our victims are victimized , period , 
and the law has no , uh , regulations to deal with that . 
they know how to deal with the penal system 
and they know how to deal with the criminal , 
but they don't know how to deal with the victim because we as citizens , i guess haven't laid anything up there for them to deal with on that aspect . 
but it's , 
but i sure don't , 
i strongly disagree with any judge passing sentence on a person himself . 
there that , 
i think it works much better if it's the actual jury . 
because , well , see the jury is dealing with the seriousness of the crime , 
the jury gets to see the whole trial , as does the judge , 
but you know , just doesn't care , you committed this crime 
so i'm just going to throw the book at you . 
whereas the jury may have a little , shall we say , sympathy , you know , 
he did this , 
but , you know , why did he do this , 
in some ,
is there a basis for it . 
in some cases it would work the other way . 
the jury would , slam them 
well , they have a stronger debate , too , because there's twelve people there . 
they have to decide whether or not he's guilty 
and then they can sit at the same time and decide what his punishment would be , 
and you'd have more than one person's input on it . 
i think that's probably a much fairer way . 
so , you know , if you can find me guilty , then you ought to be able to pass sentence . 
and a lot of jurors , 
not that i know of , 
but i don't have to deal with it from here , you know , 
it might be more , 
it would be more work for the jury , 
but it would be a more responsible 
it would , 
serving on the jury you'd have to be a definitely more responsible person . 
the thing that i don't really like , 
i don't know , if , uh , a lot of jury selection processes that i've seen have been a , 
you want to start ? 
um , yeah . 
um , i think we should have a balanced budget even if it means that services are dramatically cut back . 
if you can't pay for it , you shouldn't have it . 
that is very true . 
that's just . 
however , our whole economy is based on loans . 
uh , uh , but , bet right this moment , you probably have several loans out 
or you have borrowed money against your credit card or something 
master charge . 
i don't have a master charge , 
but , see our whole system is built on owing 
but , that's the problem , see . 
our system shouldn't be based on owing and borrowing and all that . 
uh , true . 
but , uh , uh , without it , people wouldn't be able to own automobiles 
or they wouldn't be able to own a house . 
they would . 
they just wouldn't be able to own the kind of automobiles that they think they deserve to own . or the kind of homes that we think we deserve to own . 
we might have to , you know , just be able to , 
i think , if a generation went without debt , then the next generation , 
like , our generation , 
my husband and i , we're twentyeight , um , the budget would balance . and that we became accustomed to living with what we could afford , which we wouldn't be destitute , 
i mean , we wouldn't be living on the street , by any means . 
but just compared to how spoiled we are , we would be in our own minds , 
but i feel like the generation after us would , 
oh , man , it would be so good . 
it would be so much better . 
it wouldn't be perfect , 
but then , they could learn to live with what they could afford to save to buy . 
and if you want a nicer car than that , well , you save a little longer . 
well , now uh 
i'm just taking the other side so we'll have a discussion here . 
uh , but i still go to right back to what i said . 
when is the time you had fifteen thousand dollars all at one time to go out and buy an automobile ? 
but , see , we made poor choices in college . 
we took out two , 
both of us had twenty thousand dollars in loans , for student loans 
 and i look back on that , 
and i bought shoes . 
i went shopping . 
i did not need that money . 
i shouldn't have even qualified to get it . 
and it would have been a little rough , 
i might have eaten some bologna instead of roast beef out of the deli , 
and as i look back now , now we're paying that back . 
but don't take out ten thousand dollars in loans . 
don't do it . 
and i don't think he'll have to do that
but , i just feel like if we didn't have those loans , we could have saved in the last five years the money for that , 
and i believe we would have , because god's really put it in our heart not to get in debt , you know . 
but we have friends in church that do this on a constant basis , that are totally debt free . 
and they pay cash for everything they buy . 
including new vans , 
and , so i guess , i've seen it done 
and i know you can do it , you know . 
but you have to drive that old car until you get that money saved up for that new van . 
and that's where americans don't like to do it . 
and we don't want to cut back our services from the government , because we're spoiled . 
well , i have one way to suggest reducing the budget . 
very simple . 
just take all these civil service employees ,
i know . 
now give them , 
i know . 
and that's about , uh , three or four less than civil servants get . 
now just look at that money the government could save if they didn't have all of those days off , all those holidays . 
that is true . 
because i always think the mail never comes on these days 
you don't even know it's a holiday .
well , now don't forget the mail is something else again . 
that has nothing , 
they're not civil servant people . 
but isn't it in the federal budget ? 
but isn't it part of our income , 
it's not part of our taxes ? 
it's not ? 
that's why the price of mailing a letter keeps going up . 
that's why it keeps going up , uh ? 
you know , 
that's another topic .
those stamps are valuable , now . 
they probably , 
i ought to go looking through some of my old mail . 
that's funny . 
and that is a good short term thing , though . 
that little things like that 
overall , though , i just think we're just going to , i don't know , see , 
i know , 
i guess i'm kind of leery of this topic , because i know that bush is real for the new world order . the one world government , and alleviating all , you know , national debt between all of the nations . 
but i see that to be a potential power problem later , with , um , who's going to be in charge with this new world order . 
and you know , i'm uncomfortable with that much power being in one place . 
but , i know , we already have a new money system . 
we already have new bills printed , for , 
the u s treasury already has our new bills printed for new currency , 
and i've seen them .
and so i know that the longterm vision for the u s government is to alleviate all national debts and to start over afresh , 
that's a lot of power for one or two people to have . 
and so , um , i guess because i , 
i guess , 
in fact , i know what their longterm vision is . 
and i don't think americans are willing to do it . 
well , what about , uh , uh , sending all this money overseas supporting other governments , third world governments . 
how do you feel about that ? 
i don't feel we should loan them money . 
if i wish our leaders were really seeking the lord on these things , 
and if we feel led to give a country money to help them , fine . 
but i don't feel we should be loaning money like that . 
i mean , it doesn't work , i mean . 
well , in so many cases , it's not a loan , 
it's just a give away . 
but it's not set up as a giveaway . 
if it were set up as giveaway , 
is it your will , this money and your will for us to give to them , 
and i believe if we gave it , no strings attached that god would bless our nation . 
but because our motive is interest , our motive is not pure , it just backfires , 
i mean , none of these nations have paid us back . 
but , you understand , i guess it's a principle of giving and receiving . 
you give it , no strings attached 
and they may never give you anything back , 
but because there's no strings attached , it like gives them a freedom to give us something back . 
and it might not be money , 
it might be , um , no taxes on our things , our computers going into their nation , 
it might come back in another way , 
but it would be come back . 
but because we're loaning it , i think that's the problem . 
and i don't mean give it to everybody that asks . 
use a lot of discernment . 
don't give money to every nation . 
you know , what i'm saying , 
i think we're loaning money to too many nations , 
but i think if we gave to a few select ones , that really needed it , that it would work out better for us and for them . 
and so now we have all these nations that owe us all this money 
and so i just think , we're never going to get that back , you know . 
do you understand ? 
that's true . 
i understand that france still owes us money from world war i . 
and , uh , world war two debts have never been repaid . 
i think the u s just wrote them all off . 
uh , uh , half the countries of the world simply canceled the poland debts to help them . 
  long term though , do you think it would best to see a one world , you know , 
you can't alleviate all national debts 
or do you think it would be better for our leaders to just start seeking god on how to turn our nation around financially ? 
that's my opinion . 
my opinion's the latter . 
well , uh , i've got to respect your opinion . 
you have some 
i know . 
what's yours ? 
do you agree 
or do you disagree 
or i mean , what do you think long term ? 
 well , i don't believe in a single government or a single control for the world . 
uh , that's asking for trouble . 
people are too different . 
i mean you could travel from one coast to the other here in the u s and find a tremendous differences between the peoples . 
they have their own ideas how things should be run . 
so , therefore , i don't believe there could be a single government for the whole world . 
there's too many societies involved , uh , 
the language barriers . 
that's a big laugh , 
we can't even make english a national language here in our country . 
we've got too many , uh , uh , immigrants . 
i know . 
they don't call them immigrants anymore , 
that was back in my granddaddy's day . 
different ethnic groups .
my grandfather came over from lithuania back , uh , just before the turn of the century 
 and , uh , as a matter of fact he's a draft dodger . 
he , uh , was supposed to serve some time . 
well , he did serve his time uh , in the militia . 
and he came back . 
he was a civilian again 
my major source of information , i guess , is t v news .
excuse me . i , uh , wake up to it in the morning . 
this is i guess , my prime time for news , first thing in the morning while i'm getting ready to go to work . 
oh , i quite frequently glance through headlines or , in the newspaper . 
but , uh , primarily mine is t v news . 
how about yourself ? 
i have to agree with you , um , 
i normally don't have time in the morning to watch any type of t v . 
usually catch it going to work on the radio . or when i drag the paper in from the front and   catch the head lines , which is normal what you see the night before on the evening news . 
so i've kind of , 
we have a one year old in the house 
so it's kind of hard sometimes to watch t v during the night , 
but i usually try to catch the ten o'clock or , um , 
i have to say , during the war the american public was probably flooded with too much information 
and as far as the  sub  question about was , am i  satisfactorily covered   , i have to say yes . 
but when it came to the war issues , who's telling the truth . 
between the channels there was , uh , the casualties , the amount of missiles launched were different 
and it was almost too much information , over communicated . 
well , that's true , 
but i , 
my personal opinion is that the various network news medias were trying to interpret the news to the best of their abilities since they were not very well informed by the military . 
i agree with you . 
now , i can appreciate that , especially after what happened in vietnam . 
which is a joke . 
today's , uh , means of communication , a newscaster could very well giveaway a piece of top secret information .
that's a good point . 
um , but i would have to say acrosstheboard , i'm satisfied with the way , uh , the news is spread . 
um , of course here at texas instruments , uh , the rumor mill runs rampant . 
the secretary's probably the best resource ,
very true . 
i find  tnews  very enlightening , too . 
and i check that everyday . 
of course , with that goes along with the stock price of t i . 
i agree you . 
i think , i'm glad you mentioned that , because i think i have to , since i don't have the opportunity in the morning i'll probably catch the head lines on  tnews  .
that's a good point . 
of course ,  tnews  is more or less headlines , 
uh , i don't think much of their sports coverage . 
kind of , 
only give the scores . 
but , uh , that's all right . 
outside of pro football , i'm not too interested in other games , other sports , anyway . 
but , the , uh ,  tnews  is a good way to keep uptodate . 
i think they do a pretty good job of selecting the most important items . 
they do . 
surely do . 
uh , anything else crossed your mind . 
i guess most of us go by the audio , which is the television or the radio . 
um , but you need to continue to read , so you people learn to read , you know .
well , i spent twenty years in commercial broadcasting   radio and t v , 
and i know what it takes to get some of those little bits and pieces of news on the air , 
i mean , life and limb . 
i've seen it happen time and time again . 
and , uh , well , i remember one time up in nashville , tennessee . 
one of the fellows got mixed up in a riot that was going on down there , 
but he was lucky he got out of it for some reason . 
because he was carrying a camera , 
uh , they left him alone . 
everybody got excited . 
that's tough . 
well , i've enjoyed speaking with you . 
nice to talk to you , too , jim . 
they're pretty good . 
is that right ? 
have a great day . 
i'm sorry , 
ready to go . 
excuse me . and , uh , i do that , 
we recycle , uh , newspapers . 
we take , you know , the dallas morning news daily ,
and , you know , after a month of that you got a ton ,
i know it builds up really fast . 
it really does , 
i do recycle ,
we don't really have enough plastic to mess with , 
you know , like we don't drink milk 
and we don't have children 
so we don't have , you know , six thousand plastic milk jugs ,
we do , .
with a two year old and a ,
but you know there is a place you can take those also you know at the same place just put them in a different , uh , container . 
and , uh , plano has plans 
i believe it's tentatively scheduled for sometime in may of this year , 
the city is going to leave , uh , receptacles at people's home . 
 oh , yeah , 
 and they ca , 
that would be much more convenient . 
and they can separate it 
and then the , you know , trash guys will pick it up .
or it just builds up so often , 
they can't get to the these centers . 
and i'm sure rather than try to , uh , ask someone to take them for them they probably just pitch them , you know ? 
but i think that's probably a good idea . 
they used to have several places , um , that were a little ways out in the community that did the paper and all , 
 and they stopped doing it because they said it wasn't profitable .
so finally , um , the people put so much pressure on the city , 
they did a survey of everybody , 
and they took a big huge bin that has paper and plastic , um , 
and it just really , 
every time you went by there it was just over flowing ,
that's right . 
 and so walmart complained  , 
so they moved it behind the store 
and nobody knew where it was , 
and so people kept piling stuff in the same place ,
oh , it was just like a dump there , 
i bet it was . 
 and so finally , you know , i called 
and they said , you know , it was behind there 
and i started taking my things behind there . 
so we do that because we have milk cartons , you know , constantly ,
but it just builds up , 
it would be so nice if they had it , you know at your home ,
and they have pickup there , 
it's , uh , i think once or twice a week . 
and the first couple weeks they did it nobody got their stuff out 
so they had not much participation , 
and they were going to cancel it , 
but then finally people started getting the message . 
it's just a matter of education , i think . 
and i think that , you know , if they can get enough going ,
but it's not , 
i think originally people thought it would be profitable for cities to do this , 
and it's not going to be , 
i don't think .
that's right . 
i think basically it's a good idea , you know , 
i hope it works . 
i do to because it's amazing , how much , you know , trash ,
i know this year we took our christmas tree 
they had a place ,
and they gave you a little , um , seedling to plant ,
you could take the mulch home with you , you know , and take buckets of that home , 
so that was really good idea , 
i thought . 
and there's just , you know , the two of us my wife and i 
and it's amazing how much stuff just the two of us generate , 
you know , i can imagine a family of , you know , four or five . 
oh , yeah 
it's really , 
it adds up so fast . 
it really does . 
as far as new stuff to recycle , you know , i don't really know , 
i really hadn't thought about it to tell you the truth . 
well , they're working on diapers ,
that's right , 
i was , 
i've read so many different things about diapers 
and now their saying that originally they thought the disposables were just awful , 
but now their saying that they're , really not that much in comparison to the others because you don't have to use the water to wash them ,
that's right . 
so the diaper service , trucks 
apparently the fuel that they use and the fumes that they produce to deliver ,
so i don't know what's the , you know , right thing to do 
but i really would hope that they would come up . 
i know there was a brand just briefly on the market that was recyclable  , 
but the landfill have to do something special , you know , for those , 
i see . 
but that just generates a tremendous of volume of trash too , 
 oh , i'm sure it must . 
you know i'm not personally involved because children that wear diapers , 
but i'm sure it creates a large amount of , you know , 
it does , 
and you just feel guilty if you don't do ,
that's right .
that's right . 
because you hate to contribute to the problem , 
but on the on the other hand the alternatives aren't to great either .
that's right , 
i don't know what else they could recycle more of .
i guess we don't really use that many tin cans . 
i guess there's some places where you can recycle aluminum 
but i don't know about like cans that you keep vegetables and stuff ,
i don't know if those are recyclable 
i think they're made out of aluminum , 
there is a receptacle , you know , at the centers also for aluminum , 
but again we don't generate that much 
we don't , 
we don't either , 
we usually use frozen vegetables and things 
so we don't really have ,
that's right . 
that , 
ninetynine percent of ours is newspaper and , uh , you know , uh , glass . 
well , now when we lived out in california they actually had places where you could recycle if you change the oil in your car ,
that's right . 
car batteries . 
you know i don't change my own oil , 
so i don't , uh , don't have that problem . 
well other than that i'm not really sure , 
we try to recycle old clothes .
our church has a place , 
and they , you know , pass them on to ,
we have one of those in town . 
you know , our church each year has a , 
one of their major fund raisers is , you know , a garage sale . 
and there's a ton of clothes always , you know left over 
and i take those down to the , 
 uh , it's called the clothes closet , 
that's what it's called here in plano . 
and they distribute them to the people ,
that's real helpful ,
well , i'm not sure i can't really think of anything else that we could recycle . 
i can't either  , 
um , no , 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
you to . 
all right . 
what types of music do you like to listen to ? 
well , i primarily listen to classical music when i have my druthers , partly because i find it more soothing . 
i don't know a lot about classical music so far as , uh , any background in music , 
but it's the music i enjoy the most . 
how about you ? 
i like classical music also . 
i , uh , 
like you , i don't know a whole lot about it , 
and i would like to buy more classical tapes and stuff , 
but i'm not sure which composers or which   
so i kind of hesitate 
there are certain kinds i like and certain kinds i don't . 
i tend to listen to the classical music , uh , on the radio a lot . 
well there several stations in this area that play , uh , classical music all the time , 
but there's one in particular that is on both a m and f m so i can listen to it without , uh , worrying . 
it's cute , though , because my children , when they get in the car , and i have , uh , the button pushed for that , they always switch it to something else .
because naturally that isn't their taste 
i understand that . 
are you involved in music ? 
uh , no , 
my husband is , 
but i do , uh , the world a favor 
and i don't sing aloud ,
 well , my whole family is somewhat musical , um , and not from training , but just because we sing in our choir 
and my daughter's quite involved and all that sort of thing . 
so , um , i think that one of these days maybe she'll get involved in classical music , too , because that's usually what happens unless you get into rock , which isn't her voice style . 
i don't care for rock , at all . 
i guess i'm real old fashioned in my musical tastes . 
well most of it is not all that exciting in that it is terribly repetitious . 
it's loud and repetitious without having a great deal of meaning . 
now i do like folk song . 
um , and there have been some nice folk songs over the years that , you know , kind of still hang around . 
um , but , uh , the more popular music i don't care for , usually . 
um , even when i was a teenager i didn't really like the music of that period so much because i found i liked , um , a little bit more melodious music than what was often the popular ,
i agree with that too . 
although now i kind of enjoy hearing the rock and roll , i guess it makes me think i'm young again .
now rock and roll seems tame compared to like the new age and all that stuff . 
isn't that the truth ? 
it's funny . 
in fact , it's interesting to me that so many of the songs , 
now i grew up in the late fifties and early sixties , 
and so much of the music that was popular at that time , has come back . 
and , you don't hear everything all the time , 
but you hear much of the same music , perhaps a new version of it , 
but it's the same stuff .
um , and i remember my older sister . 
i have a sister who's sixteen years older , 
and at the time that i was a late teenager i guess , i can't remember the year , smoke gets in your eyes became popular . 
i think it was done by maybe the platters or something . 
and she laughed 
but they've changed a little bit . 
well , they did it again , about two or three years ago , 
and i laughed again . 
crops up every so often . 
it does indeed . 
i listen to , um , the christian radio station when i'm in the car . 
k l t y . 
i like to listen to some of that . 
now there's some wonderful christian music when you can find good stations . 
uh , the there is inconsistency in the quality 
if you get someone who's very good at selecting , it's okay , 
but sometimes they kind of get on a binge , 
and they play the same sort of thing over and over again , without really necessarily quality . 
where do you live ? 
uh , i live in the , uh , washington , d c area ,   maryland . 
i thought maybe you lived in dallas , because that's the complaint i make to my husband about the radio station too . 
it seems like every week they pick ten 
and they just play them over and over , 
and i , you know , 
there's so much available 
but , um , now my children have sometimes , 
um , they've gone to a few of the concerts and so on of christian musicians that come to our youth group at our church . 
um , and when they buy a tape or something , sometimes that's fun because it's different and something i've not always heard , 
and , you know , i enjoy that . 
my husband likes sandy patty songs . 
he likes to sing those in church . 
oh , wow . 
that's nice . 
so , is your husband a singer ? 
he sings in the choir 
and he likes to do special music and stuff at church . 
well , that's a good thing to do . 
i like to hear him sing . 
he does a good job . 
that's nice , 
uh , well , do you have children ? 
well , wonderful . 
i guess we'll start listening , 
that'll be a musician . 
we'll start listening to children's music .
 oh , there's some wonderful christian , uh , children's tapes .
there are . 
and i know when my children were younger , um , we found a lot of really nice tapes that they liked . 
um , there was an agape music group , 
and , um , some of the songs i still find going over in my head over and over again because they were really , um , very memorable 
my youngest is almost sixteen . 
oh , uh .
but i still find uh , some of the same songs from those tapes i enjoy . 
um , there's one that's , um , a little girl singing practice makes perfect . 
and , uh , she's playing the piano . 
and so she gets the wrong note every now and then . 
but then she keeps repeating it , practice makes perfect , 
and then you know , talking about that so far as christian life , too , 
and it's really cute . 
that sounds really cute . 
uh , i tell my husband to sing to my stomach , because they say that babies can hear quite a lot while they're still in the womb , 
and i said , then when it's born you can hold it 
and maybe it'll comfort her , you know , when she's fussy and stuff . 
well do you know something ? 
because i have always played classical music , uh , or classical style , 
it's not always classical as , you know , the official , uh , word might go , 
but , um , even when i was pregnant , of course i listened to that , 
and when our first child was , you know , an infant , um , of course , when i was around the house , i played that music , too . 
when he first made sounds that you could detect they were in the music scale . 
someone else noticed it 
how strange . 
and it was somewhat melodious , 
in other words 
 you know , it was really funny .
i'll say , that is .
well , we'll have to keep up with that then . 
i do think there is probably an influence there , because i noticed that even though popular music , early adolescents , when they first start listening to music on their own 
um , this same child , um , really listened to more , um , ballady or , um , pleasant sort of songs and even classical , rather than the real hard rock stuff that so many other kids listen to . 
and i didn't want to say too much for fear he would think it was wrong and wouldn't do it anymore .
have something to rebel against .
but , uh , then i must say they all kind of like a variety of music , which is nice , 
i like that . 
that's good , 
variety is good . 
it was real good talking to you . 
well , it was nice talking to you , 
and good luck with the baby . 
well , thanks , 
okay charles , uh , gun control , 
i'm very much in favor of gun control . 
oh , you are ? 
well , this should be very interesting ,
i don't mind people owning guns , 
i just think it should be a little more regulated . 
well , you know , uh , now here's something that , uh , first occurred to me when they started having all these problems with these automatic , uh , weapons . 
uh , now there always has been a federal law against fully automatic weapons . 
i believe that's correct , 
and , yet , we should have stronger laws and what not . 
i don't understand why we don't enforce the laws we have . 
that would certainly help , 
i'm sure . 
now this is not just a state law , 
this is a federal law ,
and , uh , all right , now for instance ,
 or , uh , now what was it they called them ? 
the military version , attack weapons ,
uh , how is that going to affect the , uh , sports weapons ? i mean , rifles ,
i really don't have any problem , jack , with , you know , uh , people using firearms for sporting purposes . 
the only thing i , 
i am in favor of the sevenday waiting period . 
i would like to see that happen . 
well , now , uh , i've got to admit i'm inclined to agree with you there 
and their reason being that well , if you let one little law get through , pretty soon one's going to stack up on top of another ,
i understand that . 
and you've got to admit that congress does kind of look at things that way . 
that's true . 
like i say , i don't have any problem with people using firearms , you know , for sporting purposes or hunting purposes , 
i just think it's just may be a little too easy you know , to acquire one .
 that's true . 
uh , now did you hear about the control that they have up in virginia ? 
i'm not sure i have . 
uh , it's a little hard to believe , 
but they can , uh , of course , 
like just about every other state in the union they have a felony law . 
anyone ever convicted of cannot purchase a weapon . 
because they have access to computer records concerning all these felons . 
and the , 
uh , when you go in and buy a weapon or a handgun in , uh , uh , virginia , 
and if it comes up negative , okay , fine , 
and you get your gun right then and there . 
i see . 
uh , but they are the only state that does it . 
hm , that's interesting . 
and , uh , according to virginia , it didn't cost all that much . 
 and frankly , i don't understand why a state doesn't have those records available anyway . 
uh , uh , at least 
you would think they would . 
i'm surprised that more states doesn't do that . 
uh , uh , uh , certainly those records are available , 
and all they would have to do is expand it .
i wouldn't think it'd be that difficult to do . 
well , virginia is not a particularly rich state , 
and they managed to squeak out a few bucks to do it . 
and , uh , it's , uh , uh , onehundred percent successful . 
hm , that's interesting . 
i just heard about this last week . 
uh , they were bragging about it , 
uh , uh , they should have , have pride in this because it's a good system , 
 and it's working well . 
i agree . 
and they don't need that sevenday waiting period . 
because the whole idea of that waiting period was ,
 well , you know what's going to happen there , 
those files are going to back up on somebody's desk , just  some of  that typical bureaucratic work . 
that's another , uh , uh , thorn in my side ,
i agree . 
 i was , 
 so anyway 
i guess that's about right , 
although neither one of us are , uh , really uh , uh , dyed in the wool . 
uh , we , 
but we both , 
i'm not totally rigid on the subject , 
i just think there you know , shouldn't be quite so easy to do . 
 well , there should be some way of checking , 
now here in texas , uh , all you need is a driver's license . 
and , uh , even felons can still get a driver's license . 
sure , uh , 
so i don't think they are too , 
well , they're not rigid enough here , in texas . 
that's true . 
but don't tell the n r a i said that . 
i wo , 
i promise . 
i won't .
they're liable to tear up my membership . 
i promise .
you say you retired a year ago ? 
i'm looking forward to it in about just over a year , myself . 
i really enjoy it . 
i stay pretty busy . 
i do not quite a lot , 
i do some , uh , volunteer work here in plano . 
help them do . 
oh , uhhuh . 
well , uh , i bought a motor home here four years ago 
 and i have been living in it ever since , 
that's , uh , 
and i'm looking forward to just traveling . 
i can understand that . 
i have four sons scattered all over the country ,
and i'm looking forward to just traveling around visiting them . 
that'd be neat . 
sure would . 
 well charles , good luck to you on your , 
nice talking to you . 
take care . 
we have immigration problems 
and what do you think about it ? .
 well , i think it's a very , very complicated , 
 and i sort of , see perspectives on all sides . 
um , and i've no hope for solutions . 
but , uh , i do keep myself somewhat abreast of the issue . 
i have worked uh , uh , a little bit with refugees from ,
and you know , heard about some of the problems that they've had .
and i'm also fairly sensitive to the issues about how open should the borders be . 
because i , in general , like a smaller rather than a larger population ,
and , uh , 
where are you ? 
well , we've got a lot too . 
i'm in texas . 
in garland , right outside of dallas . 
so , we're getting a large  , 
oh , gosh , i don't know , 
i think there's like twentysix different languages now , that are spoken in the i s d . dallas innercity school district . 
cambodians , uh , asians , vietnamese . 
we're getting a lot of , uh , mexican americans , 
you know , we've had ,
well , texas ,
oh , yes . 
i'm busy right now , steven . 
steven wants me to do popcorn right now . 
and i don't know what the solution is . 
i don't either . 
it's a really delicate , uh , moral , issue . 
because , if you have , well , 
i guess the one thing i do see is that needs to be a solution is , that if you do let people into the country , i do feel you have a certain obligation to , 
to get them on their , 
because otherwise what you're doing is you're letting people in 
and you're dooming them to being underclass people . 
you know , you're dooming them to ghetto life or whatever . 
and i know and unsure of themselves when here . 
because they're coming you know , from the slash and burn intercultural society , you know , 
they're coming from the middle ages , basically . 
and they're being plunked down into america . 
many of them had been promised by the c i a , during the war over there , that because they cooperated with the c i a , and they helped the c i a out , that when they came here , the c i a would help establish them in america , 
and the c i a , of course , isn't doing that . 
and , uh , so they come here 
and they don't know what the heck they're doing . 
and they're finding themselves adrift in the big cities . 
and , of course , there are people in the big cities who would like nothing better than to take advantage of them . 
and they're incredible victims of crime . 
and part of it is this lack of , 
and i'm not saying it's easy to do , 
and i know there are a few people who are trying , 
but the funding isn't there for very much work to be going on . 
and there's a lot of graft , like people oh , giving them information that was free to them anyway if they just knew how to get it . 
uh , yeah , 
 i mean , these are people who don't have the foggiest idea about what america's like . 
um , and it's , 
until i met with them . 
and i realized that , some of the information that i just , you know , don't even realize and know is information , they don't have . 
and i never thought , well , i guess that is something you need to know , you know . 
people getting into trouble because they come here , 
and so they start farming on , uh , available land , you know . like the median strips on freeways because no one's using it . 
why can't they ? 
they have no idea why not , some of them , you know . 
the ones that have been here longer and have been in , you know , understand now . 
but when they initially come over , 
you mean , really trying to plant something ? 
that's what you're saying ? 
'cause they're farmers . 
and they're being put in the middle of the city .
 oh that's terrible . 
i mean they're nomadic farmers , you know , 
they're people who farm on the hillside and then leave the hillside to another hillside and farm on that hillside . 
these are people who've never seen flat ground before and people who've never seen property rights before . you know , these people who've never seen any machines other than those used in war . 
and , uh , they have , you know . 
so i do have a lot of sympathy for them , 
and i feel that america could try a little bit harder to help people adjusting to the american way . 
because if they don't , you know , you're going to produce an underclass , you know . 
you're going to get a situation that i think a lot like what happened to the blacks , being sort of led out of slavery 
and then many of them ended up just working the same jobs they were as slaves then . 
and there was no ,
and not being cared for . 
and , not being , you know , 
that's true . 
well , what did you do when you helped these people ? 
what did you do , 
i wasn't helping them . 
i worked with them , not to help them , but for my own purposes .
i'm a linguist 
and i was , uh , trying to learn their language , a little bit . 
and i actually , um , i mean , helped them in the sense that they received money for working with me . 
but i wasn't a social worker or anything like that . 
all right . 
i do have friends who have tried to do more ,
because all the models of teaching english are based on teaching english to spanish speakers or to other european language speakers . 
and people don't realize how different some of the languages they speak are . 
well , i'm an e s l teacher . 
oh , you are ? 
well you , 
i got my certification . 
but actually they did not teach us very many things about how really to go about helping people to learn another language .
that's been my impression . 
i mean , it's like people don't know , what they say , 
they're not withholding information , 
it's not step for step . 
they just don't have that information . 
they haven't the foggiest idea . 
 but anyway , i enjoy it . 
the kids i've worked with so far have been spanish speaking . 
 and spanish is , 
 but i'm applying for , 
it is . 
a lot of our words are the same , 
 like , you know , 
but , i love it . 
i love the culture , uh , the way that uh , they respect education and their teachers 
and i like it . 
and what i've been thinking about doing is volunteering for this , uh , asian center that , a doctor falk has started , that works with the school district . 
and inculturated , 
i thought that would be good experience for me . 
oh , i'm sure it would . 
and , i've applied at another district where many of the children are asian . 
and i think that would be wonderful too . 
it would be a good experience , 
and you'd be helping people , i'm sure . 
very much . 
not to trivialize the problems of any immigrant group but i do know the asian groups are having a lot of trouble . 
i mean , and part of the problem is that , a lot of chinese and japanese immigration from , you know , decades ago has been very successful because they valued education and so forth . 
they became a very successful immigrant group . 
not having the same success . 
the japanese were , or the chinese were , or something . 
and it's really much more complicated . 
well , the times were different too . 
the times are different , yeah . 
my neighbor , let's see , is jewish . 
and he's going through i don't know , the jewish league or something .
and he spends , 
well , right now , he's down to like once a week , 
but he was going over there several times a week to be with the family ,
and he thoroughly enjoyed it . 
oh , yeah . 
i think it's a wonderful thing to do . 
and there's a lot more , 
i guess another possible solution is , since taxpayers aren't going to start paying more money for this and , and other budgets aren't going to be cut to pay for it , uh , 
because everyone gains from it . 
would be , 
might be really useful . 
uh , and if it's , makes the community so much happier . 
what's so sad about this is both of the man and the woman had a degree having to do with computers 
and because they're so deficient in english , they haven't been able to get jobs . 
so they'll have to go back and get a degree here . you know , almost start all over . 
i've known people with effectively worthless degrees in this country . i mean , 
and they're highly educated people , 
but of course , if you're educated and you don't speak english , no one thinks anything of you . 
and this woman was , uh , stocking the shelves in a drugstore . 
i feel sorry for her . 
i do too . 
well , it's been good talking with you . 
well , thank you . 
uh , okay . 
have a good night . 
it does sound like you have some children to take care of .
i do .
uh , okay , 
you know , not , 
doesn't matter whether you're democrat or republican . 
i do get somewhat of a kick out of , 
because schwartzkopf , or the other generals , who i admire , how everyone wants to make , get them in politics . 
i think 
i was wondering what you thought about that 
they want him because he's popular , not because he can do the job . 
well , i've been thinking about it , 
and uh , i kind of get a kick out of they always want the hero , 
we're looking for a hero . 
well , time magazine was saying that in essence the general's staff was comparing to corporate presidents , 
and they said in general , generals are more familiar with training , that they believe in training more . 
they are much more educated than the average corporate president , 
and so they really were very positive on a general's staff person having a very much better education than the average , uh , corporate president . 
i think they probably have a better education than the average congressman . 
well , that , too , 
and , uh , you know , they talk about the army 
and because of the war 
and why did we win , and all that , 
and they talked about how the training was so important . 
 and that's so important in industry , 
so , you know , they're liable to be right . that generals in the service , 
and schwartzkopf , uh , you know , might make a good , uh , politician , whether it be governor or whatever , you know . 
you know , we know he's a good leader , 
we know he's a good organizer . 
i'm not the one who writes the orders . 
i'm just the one who follows them . 
it's interesting how they say that when they're usually the top dogs , you know , 
everyone has a boss , of course . 
you know , schwartzkopf was ordered to get iraq out of kuwait . 
but he wasn't the one that decided iraq needed to get out of kuwait . 
that's true , 
that was , uh , pretty easy 
go ahead . 
well , the thing that i'm wondering about is how we get a new congress . 
how do we get some of these guys that have been in there for so long , 
how do we get them to not get reelected over and over again . 
well , i have an easy answer for that , oh , i wish they would do it , is that limit it , you know , to eight or ten years max . 
you know , whether that's two 
i th , 
that may be our only answer , 
but i don't really like it . 
i don't like the fact that the president is limited in the number of terms he can serve . 
oh , you know , you're not . 
i think if the president , be him republican or democrat , 
i think if the president can prove that he's popular , you know , that he can do the job 
i think the reason why we've got these guys in congress is because of the fund raising rules . 
i mean , how many of these big campaign contributions that they're running on this year , did they get you know , just after they were elected two years ago . 
basically the people , 
you're my friend , 
and two years later he remembers that . 
and what they done is they've bought this congressman for two years . 
i don't know , 
i do like the limitation of the president , 
and i think there is a needed change . 
i think the same thing should happen for congress . 
i'd lik , you know , 
that would be my answer of an 
my god , it's ridiculous , you know . 
that's the easy way . 
i think the harder way out would be to make the guys that are in there and the guys who are trying to get in there run on more level ground .
we had . 
that's what the financing rules and the , uh , the mailing rules and the size of the office staff and all that stuff . 
and i think that , uh , the voting rules need to be changed where you have a little more time . 
 i can't believe that a country our big votes for a president from seven o'clock in the morning til seven o'clock at night , you know . 
of course they have absentee which is getting to be a lot easier , 
and i vote as often on absentee as i can because it's so easy now . 
but , i think , gee whiz , you could make it a couple days . 
it's just , if you really want the majority of the people to vote 
well , i think a lot more people could vote if they were somehow persuaded that it's something worth caring about . 
you know , like , you know , the recent election about how the dallas city council should be made up , that election last december . 
are you in dallas ? 
boy , i live in arlington . 
i am so happy not to be part of dallas 
it's an ugly mess . 
i mean , i don't know if you like the mayor ,
but i think your mayor , 
the city council , 
what is the woman's name whose , not the mayor but the , *[[typo should be who's
the manager . 
all of them need to be thrown out . 
i mean , they're just awful , just awful . 
well , what get's me is this thing , it went down to defeat last december by how many votes , by just a few hundred votes . 
and if it had passed , 
if these people had gotten out the vote , it would have passed 
and there'd be no more argument . 
but they're still fighting about it because of the 
i know . 
it's so awful that politicians always spent consulting money . that we put them in office and then they go out and spend a couple hundreds of thousands of dollars to buy consultants , 
and then they don't even do that recommendation , you know . 
i mean , it's amazing the money that they spend once they get in . 
 supposedly to benefit the minorities , 
and all the minorities had to do was go out and get a couple more hundred people to vote 
well you're right there . 
 and they would have had their way . 
uh , uh , people are , 
uh , uh , politics , uh , 
the voting is still not as much as you think in all kinds of issues really . 
it's pretty sad . 
it is . 
uh , hopefully people will get more involved . 
my position is people who don't vote don't have any right to complain about the way the government's going . 
oh , yeah , 
but those are the ones that are complaining , i think , a lot . 
i see it here at t i . 
the guys that don't take any interest in , and constantly on the negative of everything . 
and , uh , 
and you ask them why they don't vote , 
that's where they get the jury duty list , is from the voter registration . 
you're right , 
i think they could do more about , uh , voting . 
what are the issues ? 
i'm a democrat , 
i want to just say that i'm so sad that there isn't a strong democrat . 
i don't even know , 
i could go out and debate george bush better than i see any democrat doing it . 
you know , i mean , at least i'd like to see compe , 
because i like competition , you know . 
i think rolling over and put your belly up and play dead , 
i'm so disgusted with the democratic party , 
in presidential races that's about what they've done , 
but they've got a pretty good lock on congress and 
but i still think in the last ten years , 
you know , of course that's not a recent event , 
that's only my opinion , 
i guess i really shouldn't talk about that . 
but , i don't know whether they're recent events . 
oh , really , i , 
i don't know , 
i'm amazed by , 
of course , we're not talking about politics , 
we'll get to politics , i'm sorry .
and that was three minutes ago . 
hey , well thanks for the call . 
i'm originally from new york 
and i go visit a lot 
and their real estate up there is , i mean ridiculous , absolutely ridiculous . 
an apartment here , 
like i live in an apartment 
and my apartment is three fifteen a month 
and it's just the one , 
 and how big is it ? 
which is still kind of expensive 
but i prefer to live uh , in a nice part of town because i feel safe here . 
 and i pay more to feel safe , you know . 
well what's included in that ? 
you mean in a one bedroom ? 
oh , nothing . 
nothing . 
i mean just nothing , no microwave , 
i have ceiling fan , 
i guess that's something . 
which one is it ? 
it's wood , uh , 
listen to me i can't even think of the name of my own apartment . 
where is tha , 
right next to village green , 
it's on , 
 oh , okay , 
kind of far north waco . 
i used to live in waco 
oh , okay , 
far north , like on lake shore where all those apartments are , 
it's right up there , 
uh , we live in a house here , 
 and , uh , it's a three bedroom two bath , 
 and , uh , i don't know 
i got two numbers today , 
actually we were talking about mortgage insurance today with my agent ,
and , uh , it's about sixteen hundred square feet ,
but had more square footage , 
 but they didn't use it right , you know . 
it was a bunch of empty , you know , hallway and stuff that cur , 
that could have been used as   
so we've used every bit of it 
and our house , um , we bought it for sixtyfour , 
 and , uh , the neighbors house next door to us sold for seventyfive , 
 so , you know , got a good deal on it . 
so that looks good when you all get ready to sell , you'll probably do really well . 
my father used to live in dallas , uh , 
now , he went back to new jersey , 
we're originally from the east . 
but he , 
 oh really , 
my husband's from new jersey .
 oh , really , 
uh , well actually right now he lives in rhode island , 
he lived in new jersey for a while , now he's in rhode island . 
and , uh , he used to like to go , 
and we used to go , just every weekend just to look at houses , for no reason , we weren't buying one every weekend , but just to look at them . 
and so i got a pretty good feel of , you know , what i want when i do , you know , get my house , whenever that is , um . 
what was i going to say about that , 
i completely lost my train of thought . um , 
but we enjoy going looking at houses 
and , uh , we now , 
i kind of have a good idea of what i want . 
i know i want a big family area , 
that's what we were looking for the first thing . 
uh , yeah , 
a fireplace , 
i saw this awesome house the other weekend , 
it was a great big family room 
and it was circular 
and the other side was the patio and the backyard , 
and it had a built in , uh , grill 
and every , 
 i mean , the ultimate party room , you know , 
but that's pretty nice . 
but that's what we had , uh , uh , 
that's what we had looked for , was our main concern was a big living room ,
i like a lot of closet space , 
i don't like because , 
i don't like to have a lot of things out , you know , just all over the place , 
i like to have them kind of tucked away . 
and , uh , so that's what we went for first 
we just have a big living room 
and a dining room is separate , 
 and , you know , some places have , 
like the house next door to us that we looked at ,
 but to stick a wall between two rooms didn't do anything for us just so we could have a living room and a den . 
so , we opted for the just , the whole wide room ,
my father had , uh , 
i keep talking about my father because he owned a house , 
uh , he had the kitchen , kind of a kitchen and a very long family room , 
it's just kind of one room 
and what he did , he put , uh , a bar right in the center ,
and it kind of separated it . 
it was still , you know , together , 
but it just looked a lot better . 
because i personally don't like the combination rooms . 
i think for where we are ,
and you know , we have a , 
uh , the backyard is just huge . 
it is just really , 
i think another house could fit back there . 
i'd like a big backyard . 
 and , uh , we really liked it , 
of course , when you have to mow it  ,
 oh really . 
a little hot . 
try to do it early in the mornings . 
 but , uh , it's nice 
and that was , you know , a big selling point too , 
and i think another thing that was really nice was that our neighbors on the other side of us bought the lot right next to us . 
 and they've lived there and have it all built up , you know , 
they've got a whole garden and trees and everything 
so it's not like , we're , uh , 
we don't have a neighbor's fence coming up to ours .
well that's good . 
 that's true , 
they do throw those up . 
and , uh . 
are you all planning to move anytime , 
in fact , uh , we talked about that just a little bit , you know , 
we were joking around about , uh , winning a sweepstakes ,
you know , i like where it is 
and i like how it's laid out 
and it took us forever to find it . 
to find it , 
 but when we found it , we knew it . 
you knew that was it . 
i'll probably move , 
but i'll probably move to another apartment or something because i'm really , uh , 
what's the word , 
i move a lot anyway ,
like here , i'll be here for like a year 
and then i'll move off , 
i can move up , 
and so . 
i'm a news reporter . 
 oh , okay . 
i work at channel six . 
 oh , okay . 
 and so this is like my first job 
so i won't be here very long , 
 so i'm not even looking to buy anything as permanent as house , you know , 
 so i'm staying in an apartment 
and i'm not married or anything , 
you know , you get into a house it's like , you get more stuff , 
 and to put it all back into an apartment would just never work   .
god , i can't believe we moved out of an apartment and had this much stuff 
and it actually fit , you know . 
of course we got it on , a little bit of more furniture and stuff , 
but it was just unreal . 
like i'm amazed at how much stuff i've accumulated in my apartment ,
and i could take all my stuff home , because i didn't have a bed or a couch or any of that , 
 but now i could not move back home . 
and i just realized this , you know , the other day , 
i can't go back home for the summer or anything , i have too much stuff . 
 so , it was just like a weird transition out of home  , 
so i have to move in apartments just because i have so much stuff . 
and that's , 
actually three fifteen over there's probably not real , real bad . 
it's not , 
for waco 
and for as many , 
 oh my goodness , 
 i mean it's just , 
 and especially around lake shore area , that area's picked up quite a bit since we were there , 
and , uh . 
there are tons of apartments down here , i mean , 
and it , 
because i had lived in the , 
gosh , i'm not sure what they're called now 
but they were lake shore apartments that are like right next to the m c c baseball field , 
m c c , 
i think they're called lake shore villa or something . 
the ones next door to those , 
there were lake shore , 
there's a , 
i don't know what they look like now . 
and it's a nursing 
there was a nursing home or something right there . 
and then there's an apartment 
and then there's another apartment . 
and we lived in those third ones 
and they we moved in when they were brand new ,
how often do you all come through waco ? 
oh , every now and then , 
it just , 
depends on what's going on . 
it's , uh , 
and it's not really , 
now that it's sixtyfive it doesn't take hardly anytime to get there , you know , run to the mall or run to sam's or , 
we used to run to you know , red lobster 
but now they've got one in killeen , 
all right .
we don't have to run that far .
so that's about how things are 
and seems like the market here's picking up . 
you think , 
i really think it is . 
just for the fact that the , you know , 
it seemed like as soon as we bought this house we saw all these houses for sale ,
and i think now a lot of them are selling 
and a lot of sellers are getting close to what they want instead of , you know , just having to give it away . 
waco to me seems like it's pretty steady . 
i mean i'm not a real estate person or anything , 
 but it's a real college town 
and so you know , you have these apartments 
and then most of the houses are pretty nice , 
 and i don't , you know really see a lot on sale or anything 
and people are pretty stable here . 
you know , i kind of see this as kind of a retirement community , as i always call it . 
i see that a lot too , there . 
and it's nice too . 
i liked living there . 
nice and quiet , 
so . i don't think i could live here much longer 
but  ,
 well  it   , 
i guess we chewed up the house market ,
okay well it was very nice talking to you . 
you too , tanya . 
you take care , 
all right . 
bye , bye . 
bye , bye . 
well , what kind of car , 
did you just buy a car 
or are you in the market to buy a car 
actually , i'm real close to being in the market to buy a car . 
i've got , uh , a couple older cars , 
they're both over ten years old 
 and , uh , they've served me well , 
but i kind of would like to get a more , uh , gas efficient car 
uh , i've got three children at home . two fourteen year olds and a twelve year old , 
and so i need to make sure i've got one that i can fit ,
and if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time . 
i seem to remember when i was young that was a problem .
well , uh , i've kind of been leaning towards a caravan . 
uh , now i know that , uh , they've gotten quite pricey in the last couple of years , 
but , uh , i like the dodge products 
and , uh , uh , couple times i've had a opportunity to rent one 
 uh , i've been really pleased with its performance and with the size 
and because if you get the seven passenger version you can put some space between the kids . 
and , uh , i think that would serve us well . 
plus it's got , uh , good storage capacity in it for , you know , taking things along ,
which is the one that has modular type seats ? 
you know which one i'm talking about ? 
they have the commercial on tv where you can pull some seats out , 
and you can move around . 
exactly correct . 
if you want , 
is that the dodge caravan ,
it , uh , 
the dodge caravans will do that . 
uh , you can take the , uh , uh , 
usually there's uh , a double seat behind the , uh , front buckets . 
and then if you get the , 
and then there's a or three person seat that goes in the back . 
now what you can do is you could take that middle seat out and just have the three seats in the back ,
or you can take the , uh , three seat out and just use the two seat 
or you can take the two seat and move the two seat to the back . 
so it's very versatile . 
you can move ,
about the only thing you can't do is take that three person across seat ,
well , the one that , 
i can't remember or one of the other ones . 
i don't know if it's one of the americans or the import ones where , uh , they actually have like , uh , some bucket seats in the back 
but you can actually pull them out . 
i mean they're really easy to pull out . 
uh , and you can , uh , move them around and stuff 
and it , 
to me , that would be real good for us . 
uh , my husband and i , uh , like to go camping and stuff , 
and right now we have a van which is , 
it's an older van 
and we're thinking about buying another sedan , uh , probably next year . 
uh , right now motorcycles takes precedence ,
but , uh , next year we'll probably buy a new car 
and we're looking at , uh , possibly the honda accord . 
uh , that's kind of , uh , 
as far as the interior , it's got the luxury interior , 
but it doesn't really have the luxury price tag that a lot of the other cars have , which is one of the things that we were looking at .
i think that's getting to be kind of important now that , uh , the price is becoming the driving factor , 
and then you look at , 
once you realize how much money you've got to spend , then you start looking around you looked at the car you wanted , 
and then you looked to see how well you could afford it .
or how you could afford it . 
well , i think it's going to be a lot easier now . 
i just heard that they lowered the prime lending rate , 
so i think it's going to be a lot easier to , to be able to get a car now 
i think banks are going to be a little bit more lenient . 
i know they're trying to do everything they can to , uh , end the recession . 
and dropping the prime is probably one of the things . 
i just bought a new house 
so i got a , uh , nine and a half percent interest rate . 
i'm not sure i could do much better today . 
but , uh , that is also effecting buying a new car .
i can imagine . 
you got to kind of work that into your budget . 
well , that and that , 
balance that and the house payment , 
and of course , uh , if you buy a new car you're going to , 
are any of your kids driving age yet ? 
are they twins ? 
oh , wow . 
you're going to have twins have them on the bicentennial , is our motto . july fourth seventysix .
so , uh , uh , i've still got another full year and three months before they're going to be behind the wheel ,
so america's safe for another fifteen m , 
and , uh , after that , 
 , now i may keep i currently have , for them to drive . 
you know , feel safe that ,
i don't get that kind of feeling with the kind of car like you talked about , the honda . 
they're just , 
well , have been very safe .
is that right ? 
 matter of fact  i just heard something today on the news about those , uh , 
 uh , they're questioning the safety of those now saying that , 
and they showed , uh , a simulation where there they had a dummy in the car 
and the door opened 
and the dummy actually fell out of the car 
and the car rolled out on top of him . 
so they're saying they're not as safe as , 
they give the appearance of being safe , 
but they're really not as safe as they , uh , appear to be . 
so , uh , i'm kind of concerned about that as far as , you know , the seat belts . 
uh , i don't know if maryland has uh , a seat belt law ,
but they do have one in texas . 
and you're , 
the thing is that they're , 
i think it's a two part seat belt , though , 
there's the , uh , door belt 
and then there's one ,
but , uh , probably about , well , i don't know about ninety , 
but probably fifty percent of the people that have those probably don't wear the lap portion of it . 
i know my brother doesn't 
and he has one in his car . 
make sure you smack him around then .
 so , i mean , it kind of gives you a false sense of security . 
you think , oh , i've got one portion of my seat belt on , uh , 
but if your door comes open , you know , it's not going to do you any good . 
so , that's a concern of mine as far as , uh , what i'll be looking at with buying a new car . 
uh , i'm not really sure if i would want the seat belts attached to the door . 
i think i would feel better with them attached to the actual car . 
the inside where they're normally attached to ,
uh , the supports . 
uh , a good source of information i've found has always been these , uh , used car manuals 
and they'll give you a list of all the problems that the car's had in the past . 
and you can look at uh , the track record on ,
and , you usually notice , uh , a lot of problems at the beginning and then things kind of iron out ,
and you get an idea on how well the next car's going to be . 
now as long as they aren't changing the model , you know , like when the , uh , pontiac grand prix went from being a huge car to a small car they had a lot of problems ,
as long as they aren't , 
the le mans is like that , too . 
uh , we used to have a le mans when i was in high school , uh , 
and it was a big car . 
i mean it was like uh , the grand prix , 
and in , i think around nineteen eighty , uh , they changed the model 
and it , like , went to half the size . 
literally , i mean it got chopped in half 
and it wasn't even the same car anymore . 
didn't even remotely resemble the old car . 
i remember when that happened . 
so unless they're really changing the model , uh , yeah , chances are that it's probably going to have the fewer mistakes than it had the year before . 
well , everybody that i've talked to who's ever had a honda 
and my husband had a honda , uh , 
and it was a lease car 
and he had to turn back in , uh , a year and a half ago . uh , 
and he had it for four years and never had a single problem with it . 
and it was great . uh , 
and the only reason why we ended up not buying it was because we didn't feel , at the time the residual was like sixtyfive hundred dollars 
and it was a four year old car with seventy thousand miles on it 
and we thought that was a little bit too much to pay for 
i agree . 
so , so we ended up , 
and got out of the lease . 
uh , one thing some of the vans i think , i don't know about the dodge caravan , 
but some of the vans now have driver side air bags .
uh , you know , i had wanted to go to the peace corps 
and , uh , it seems like wanted to do . 
seems like wanting to go to the peace corps was something that i had really wanted to do when i was young . 
but , uh , i don't believe they accept you you know , after you're married 
and you have , uh , kids and all that 
so i got into ,
and then i wasn't able to , uh , participate . 
but they will accept you later in life also . 
oh , they will ? 
oh , i didn't know that . 
then there's no age limit ? 
some of the people that have been involved with peace corps , among other things , were retired teachers . 
uh , there was a retired plumber that went to , uh , uh , uruguay i think and helped them quite a bit with concepts in plumbing , you know , providing for better public hygiene . 
goodness i'm surprised . 
i really had no idea . 
but , so , do you think that people should be required to give a couple years for the good of the country ? 
well ,  , it should be mandatory . 
i mean , 
that just might not be something that everybody wants to do , 
i mean , there are a lot of people who would like to do it , 
and there are a lot of people who get into other things 
and they get all involved 
and they just , you know , don't want to or don't have the time . 
well , i understand , 
but if it were  told to us  that we would find the time somewhere between our seventeenth and , uh , twentysixth birthday to give a year or two to the , to the country in the form of maybe building better roads or the parks service or the peace corps or you know , the military service or something . wouldn't we have , uh , maybe a better class of americans ? 
i don't see how that to make it mandatory for everybody to participate . 
a lot of our , uh , 
pardon the terminology , 
but yuppies , now , are interested in one thing and one thing only 
and that's themselves . 
that's true . 
well , i don't think that , 
 and at least if you legislated , 
and do something for the country for two years that the country will compensate me in some way . 
i will be compensated for this , 
i'm not just going to , 
it will be a job of sorts , 
i'm sure , that the peace corps doesn't pay well , 
it's not top wages , 
but it does pay . 
the military , 
for young  hiring in  soldiers does pay , 
it doesn't pay well . 
okay , currently in our country , especially in some regions , there's an employment problem . 
you're aware of that i'm sure . 
that's true . 
but even in our region there's an employment problem . 
there's a lot of , uh , people gotten laid off lately . you know , from  just  companies like general dynamics , and , 
and texas instruments . 
thousands , and thousands of people are out there looking for jobs . 
 you know   , in another time we had the w p a ,
 , no , 
i'm not , 
uh , that gave people pay that was halfway between relief which was welfare ,
i see , 
and some program where people gave their time ,
in trade for ,
they gave them food and uniforms 
public roads that were worked on by the w p a , uh , dams that were built by the w p a ,
our road system's falling apart . 
well , then i guess there are a lot of things that people could do to contribute to the good of the country . 
there's a lot of work to be done . 
i really don't see anything wrong with it , 
i just don't think that it should be mandatory that every person have to do that . 
i can't see the problem in it for a year . 
what i'm saying is that if it were mandatory ,
then they , 
at least one not more than say three or four , then it would definitely effect unemployment . 
all right , 
i wonder you know , that they would have enough . 
i don't know . 
i mean , i'd probably , 
well , you know , texas , new mexico , colorado , huge numbers of other western states , have no real welfare system . 
there's aid to dependent children , and aid to mothers of dependent children , 
but there's no real welfare system . 
but if we took these people off the streets for a year , there would darn sure be more hours labor available in the nation for everyone else . 
and who knows , maybe some of our graduating high school seniors would find out a little bit more of what the traditional american work ethic means . 
you know , we have had some problem with that in recent years . 
oh , well , yes , 
we have . 
i know exactly what you are talking about , 
 i mean , i know several people who do not wish to work . 
uh , they wish only for the paycheck . 
 well , they wish for the money 
and uh , 
really producing . 
be it selling drugs or whatever . 
 so , one  other thing , 
and they get the money anyway they can . 
and maybe if we instilled the work ethic , you know , 
i enjoy working . 
do you get together with family reunions 
uh , we have not in some years now . 
and i think we are going to try to have one this summer . 
oh , that will be fun 
my aunt 
uh , where is your family from ? 
uh , missouri . 
is it ? 
southwest part of missouri . 
so you are going to have to go there ? 
i have been out of town , 
so i do not know what she has been doing . 
but , uh , they are all getting very , very old . 
all my aunts and uncles . 
so we need to see them soon . 
my family is from kentucky . 
most of them is down there . 
i have got an uncle in louisiana and another sister here in texas . 
do you all get together often ? 
we did when i was growing up . 
it was every summer we got together . 
now , my grandmother just passed away this last year . 
so , you know , 
i think as 
she was th , 
all my aunts and uncles are in their eighties now , 
so it is , uh , 
uh , one of these , uh , days . 
but , uh , 
well it ,
so , uh , it takes a lot of effort to either get everybody called or written and settle on a date , you know 
and if they are , 
well , we , 
in kentucky it wasn't hard because everybody lives so close together . 
we just did it you know , by word of mouth . 
you know . and , uh , my uncle in louisiana , he is the only one that , you know , had to travel . 
and now i have got a sister in germany , 
oh , my gosh . 
so it is going to be hard this time . 
so the , 
but we have got a huge family . 
and we need to have more and more of them . 
people getting together as they do spread out all over the world . 
because it is so fun . 
i mean , 
it is . 
oh , i see . 
she has got a huge family . 
and every one of them have five or six kids . and most of them , you know , 
sure , that makes a big crowd . 
it is , 
we had two baseball bleachers full of people , 
is that ? 
and there are still about eight or ten people taking pictures . 
is that right ? 
and it was just , 
the last time we had one it was so fun . 
that is wonderful . 
i hope , 
well , we need to have another one . 
i hope my aunt is successful as , uh , later . 
well , it is probably not going to be done because i have not heard from them . 
it was supposed to be this june , 
so i do not imagine there is anything coming . 
this is hardly , almost june . 
well , i , 
but it has away been the same park 
and there is nothing really special there . 
only thing is , it is big , 
that is , 
and it is open . 
we have it usually uh , at this one park because there is a pavilion there , in case 
and , uh , you have to have it , uh , fairly early in the summer or it is too hot up there . 
in missouri ? 
it is not , 
it is just , uh , very humid , 
and the old people cannot take it anymore . 
well , that was part of the problem with the ones we have . 
now , the kids would sneak off . 
and we were just being kids , 
and we found what we thought was just an old water hole . 
so we was going swimming . 
and , like i said , we was just big kids . 
we was like eight and ten years old . 
and our parents came and caught us . 
we had been sump . 
it was part of the sewage cleaning system . 
isn't that great ? 
kyle , don't . 
i have got a four year old . 
well , that keeps you busy . 
but if we could have gotten it by a lake or something , i thought that would have been much better . 
it would have been . something for the young people 
well they , 
uh , i remember now , there was like , uh , a baby pool ,
i remember my little brother riding a bicycle through it . 
we were all kids anyway .
every family has all that going on , 
i am sure . 
so , uh , 
oh , but i love it , all the different foods , because that , 
oh , i do too . 
that is the best part of it . 
that's the , 
and oh , grand , 
so , how long did you say it has been since you all had one ? 
i do not know . 
i think it has been , uh , tried to get everybody together . 
they are just spread out so much , 
what kind of crowd they get . 
i hope , 
well , i have been married almost five , 
so i guess it has been seven years since we have had one . 
and since then we have lost , oh , well , just our grandmother . 
that is surprising . 
well , time flies so fast , 
it may have been that long since we have one . 
it is hard to remember , 
but i think it has been about four or five years . 
so , uh , anyway i hope both our families get to have one soon . 
oh , if i can ever get down to kentucky . 
it has been like four years since i have been home . 
it is difficult with little ones . 
i know when we had , 
that is ,
i would get on a bus any day by myself , 
but i won't do it with the babies . 
because , uh , i have got , uh , a four month old and a four year old . 
oh , lord . 
so i am just starting . 
and i just quit too .
oh , i am telling you . 
that is , uh , 
uh , i won't be adding any more to the family reunion .
with two little ones like that . 
they are good kids though . 
so , uh , i am not too upset . 
anyways , i have enjoyed talking to you . 
enjoyed talking to you . 
all right . 
good luck in everything . 
all right , you too . 
well let's see , um , 
i like to go out to eat , 
i really do , 
but being from dallas , um , i think we have an average of six or seven restaurants that open and close every month 
and we have a really high turn over rate . 
oh , really ? 
oh yeah 
i mean there are streets just called restaurant rows 
and , uh , you can get everything here from , um , a very spicy indian meal to , you know , the favorite barbecue and , uh , just anything your little hearts desires around here , 
so , here they have to entertain us to make us come back . 
 and i guess it's all one big game because you just never run out of places to go , 
you really don't . 
that's good . 
i never really thought about that , 
but , uh , a good turn over would be sort of nice . 
course if you find a place you like and it works out that no one else likes it , it would be sort of sad to see it go under . 
and we go to , you know , like an older part of town 
and we just notice how many , oh well 
that restaurant's changed , 
and oh , gee , there , they've changed 
and , oh , we've got to go try that one , you know , 
and it's really , 
you have the pick of you know , the crop here . 
are they big into ambiance down there 
or is it more like , 
uh , texas to me makes 
it seems like it would be portions would be the big thing . 
 you know , your fourteen ounce steak with your potato and stuff . 
um , you can get that too . 
they've got everything here from the , uh , french room which is ultra , ultra to , um , um , dean  ferrings   , uh , uh , restaurant which is the mansion on turtle creek . 
i mean we've got beautiful places to go . 
you can get as dressed up or , you know just going to the local barbecue and just doing take out . 
 so , you know .  guess , uh , some of the foods that we really enjoy though are the , um , um , like chinese , 
 and we're always searching around for chinese . 
and now , of course , they've added the taiwanese , 
any part of the country you want to hit , they have got it . 
i mean , vietnamese restaurant we went to , you know , last week . it's great , 
it's good stuff , you kno , 
but , uh , it's very , very mixed 
and , uh , you know , i think if you like food like we do , 
i don't know if that happened before or after we moved here 
but , um , 
but if you were going to a restaurant , say , um , where would you go ? 
oh , well uh , we have a lot of favorites here , uh , in northern virginia 
and of course we've got d c to call on , you know , 
 and there's all sorts of things down there . 
one thing about d c is that there are a lot of traditional restaurants where , you know , the guy used to be the cook for the capitol 
and so he stays in the same restaurant for twenty years , you know , 
 oh , okay . 
 and he's got a big clientele 
and , um , so there are some hang outs where you can go if you want to see people . 
you know , there's favorite haunts for southerners and things like that . 
um , we don't hang around with them , because usually it's , you know , ninety dollars a plate or something silly like that . 
so , uh , but , uh , my wife has runs one of the restaurants down there 
and we've been down there and had french cuisine , 
and , uh , i don't know , 
i don't particularly care for that sort of thing , just the type of food , just because i do like , uh , you know , getting a meal . 
i see . 
 and , uh , most french food always leaves me hungry for some reason . 
 i don't know what they say about chinese , 
i'm always hungry after a french meal , uh . 
that's true too . 
and , uh , 
but the atmosphere is just wonderful . 
you do feel like you've gone out , you know , and done something ,
to another place , 
well as out here you might have enjoyed the meal and go away feeling satisfied , it's not so much an event , you know , out in the suburbs when you go to a local restaurant . 
and they're starting to get a little bit different , um , 
the people with the money are coming out and living in the suburbs , getting away from the city 
and so there are a couple jazz houses , you know , that have jazz bands playing while you're eating and stuff like that ,
 oh , there you go , 
oh , we're sort of in the middle of , uh , the extension of the cajun country too , so we have , um , a lot of ambiance provided by , you know , you know , like you said jazz bands and things like that . 
you know , 
and you eat your crawfish and 
you know , i really don't like that stuff 
but my husband does . 
he loves to cook it 
and they cook , i mean , you know , like for a bunch of people 
and , uh , it's really , 
in fact , we do a lot more entertaining i think at home than we do going out . 
so when we do go out we really , you know , want to be wowed by , um , the presentation , so to speak . 
and , uh , you know , but there are little places , um , 
and like i said , some of our very favorites are the chinese restaurants , 
 and we do a lot of take out because everybody's so busy running around , 
 and it's the fastest thing to do , 
we have uh , two very special places in northern virginia that people go to . 
uh , one's called captain pell's 
maryland is , you know , a big place for crabs with the bay pretty much taking over most of maryland . 
and , um , captain pell's is a place with the big huge wooden tables inside , 
 and people just go in there and just pig out and everything . 
and then , um , the other place is called the vienna inn which is , uh , uh , 
vienna is a suburb of d c also in virginia 
and , uh , that place is known for are at the vienna inn . 
 and , uh , people go there to be abused . 
i mean , 
and people come all over the country amazed at , um , the abuse they were seized . 
and then it's on the honor system . 
you pay totally on the honor system . 
and so , you know , you tell them what you've eaten and what you drank or whatever 
and they figure out the bill for you 
and you're lucky if you get change . 
 because , uh , they , 
carry on with the abuse , 
here guy , you don't get any change , you know . 
oh , gee . 
well that's funny , 
we just went to an italian restaurant this , 
um , just wonderful 
and they , i mean 
it's like being in it , 
i mean i've never been to italy , okay , 
but it's just this big beautiful italian restaurant . 
very , um , low key in terms of the people are from california , you know , 
so they have their own adaptation of what italian is . i mean , 
but it was a wonderful , wonderful experience . 
you know they have , uh , women there and graduating in opera or something like that 
and they are all singing arias to you and , 
 oh , wow . 
and they make the food right there so it's display cooking 
and , uh , then they have wine casks all over the place so you're lined up waiting in line to this place 
and you just take a drink of wine 
and , you know , they don't count that really , 
they just , 
okay , you say you're going to buy a new car . 
well no , 
it's probably going to be a very old used one . 
my husband had an accident in my car a little over a week ago , 
and i drove a nineteen seventyseven , um , b m w 
and so i believe 
and i'll know the answer today ,
i think that it will cost more to fix it than it's probably worth . 
but i'm not interested in having any car payments , 
so i actually went last weekend with , 
my father was in town 
and we went and looked at used cars around town . 
uh , and you know , i found like a nineteen eightyfour regency ninetyeight with only fortysix thousand miles on it 
and that was pretty good condition , uh . 
but i also found a nineteen eighty volvo , uh , station wagon 
i mean there's not a dent on the outside body , 
the inside is clean 
it's had the same owner for years . 
it has about eighty thousand miles on it 
but that's all right , you know , 
the engine's in excellent shape , 
and i think it would last me probably another fifty or sixty thousand miles . 
so , i guess i'm kind of in limbo waiting to see what the insurance you know , company is going to do , to see whether or not i can get one of these cars . 
i don't want a new car though , 
a new car payment . 
i understand that . 
we , uh , just paid off one , my wife's car , uh , i guess , early last year 
and so we're , you know , enjoying not having every month 
and , but it's getting up in age , uh , 
we're trying to hold out a little while longer , uh , 
we've got a daughter who's almost two now , 
but , uh , 
it's tough on trips because , uh , 
well not only that , needing the room , you know , we finally ended up buying a dodge caravan here about two and a half years ago ,
i have one that's now , 
well she'll be four in september and then a little boy that's just turned two . 
and you know it's like you go on a trip 
and , you know , you pull over to the side of the road , throw them on the hood , change a diaper and keep going .
and i wanted something that i could maybe walk through and get to them 
that's what , 
i've thought of that possibly , uh , getti , 
i don't know that my wife would go for it , 
i have a truck myself 
and i'll take , you know , 
a truck's a thing that you need when you need it , 
so , i've still got a couple years payments on it . 
i may , 
uh , if we can hold out til then , you know , i may for long trips especially . 
we have definitely put a lot of use in on ours 
and i understand , it is too expensive to have two car payments . 
see that was the problem , my b m w was paid for , 
and my husband's been in business for himself for several years 
and so he can depreciate cars , 
but you hav , 
used to be you kept them three years . 
well when they did all the tax law changes you had to keep them five . 
so i was trying to keep my b m w in tact , uh , for three more years .
and we'd trade my car in on a new car for his business . 
and so basically that's what i'm looking for in a used car . something that's going to last me at least three years . 
well if i can pull a deal on this volvo , you know , it will last me longer than that . 
it will actually last me quite a while , 
but i don't know how families afford two new car payments . 
it's just , 
i don't either . 
well , my wife's car is probably around five years old now , 
and it's got , oh , uh , 
i guess it must have seventy or eighty thousand miles on it , you know , 
and so it's getting , 
it's not in bad shape 
you know , she's kept it up real well , 
but , uh , you know , it's getting to the point where we really need to do something with it , you know , 
that's right . 
so , i'm hoping we that we can work something out here . 
we've got other bills that kind of preclude us buying ,
know how that goes .
it's the pits , 
isn't it ? .
a car payment now . 
it just ,
that's right .
it's almost getting to be like the house payment , you know . 
i know , 
you can't find what you used to , 
could find something for , you know , seventyfive , a hundred dollars a month . 
it might not be brand new 
but it was a decent car , 
and you just almost can't find that payment anymore . 
so , i understand that , it's kind of hard to go do . 
well if you do look at them , i really recommend the dodge caravan . 
we've had wonderful , 
it's the only , uh , minivan they make that's on a car chassis instead of a truck chassis so it doesn't ,
oh , i didn't know that . 
and we have had just wonderful luck with ours . 
i mean we take it everywhere , 
it's so easy to get the kids in and out , 
see my car was also a two door . 
 which drove me nuts trying to get car seats and kids ,
oh man , 
and so it's wonderful to have the room and the space 
and you can haul things 
and they climb in easily 
and , it's just been everything that we were hoping it would do for us . 
and it is nice on long trips . 
in fact , christmas we drove to california , which is my home , 
and you can take out the middle seat , 
and they come out fairly easily , so we took out the middle seat , put the car seats in the back and just had a whole area in the middle , like if we were out on open road 
and it was their nap time , 
we just went ahead and laid them down . 
you know , i wouldn't do that if we were in a city , or , if there were a lot of cars around or anything . 
but it made it so much easier to travel . 
n , uh , 
it's just long stretches , you know , where they just have to sit , you know . 
in town she does okay , you know , 
and even on the road she does all right for a little while because she'll sleep some , 
uhhuh , uh . 
but , you know , i , 
she wakes up , 
she wants to get up . 
i know , uh , right before christmas we had driven over to shreveport 
and we were driving back 
and it was when all that bad weather was hitting , 
oh , yeah . 
and the roads were all closed , 
and , uh , we were trying to get back 
and it took us a lot longer 
and you know , she was pretty good most of the way , 
but then , get to a point where she just had to get out of her seat and we had to stop , 
it's a long time . 
and she was fine , 
but , you know , on the highway , or where , where it wasn't , 
so , can do something like that later on . 
well that would be good . 
we'll see what we can do . 
well i gue , 
well , i appreciate talking to you . 
good luck in your car buying . 
you too , 
i ho , 
well , really i'm supposed to hear today 
and i hope it , 
i really would prefer the volvo , i think , 
i know it's older than the regency 
but , you know , they're built of that unibody steel construction 
and it would take a hit fairly well , 
and you know , my b m w that my husband was going forty to fortyfive miles an hour 
and you know , it didn't even bend the frame . 
it bent in the bumper and the quarter panel , 
but unfortunately they think if it says b m w on it that you have money . 
they don't know , 
what are your favorite things to watch ? 
oh , uh , let's see , 
uh , i have enjoyed , uh , thirtysomething 
uh , some comedy shows , uh , i can not think of , off hand , 
 but , what are your , 
what is , 
we do not watch a lot of t v , 
we try to watch it on thursday nights , 
we usually watch l a law , 
i like that real well .
we like to watch that . 
uh , we sort of got hooked on la law . 
uh , do you ever watch that ? 
and i have watched thirtysomething some in the last couple seasons . 
i was sort of sorry to see it go 
it was kind of interesting , uh , some people complained about , uh , uh , the kind of whining or whatever on it . 
it was ,
i think it had uh , good situations that it presented . 
i thought a lot of the , 
like the problems that michael and hope had in their marriage and stuff , i can relate to some of those things . 
just the dynamics of it and everything . 
well , i think a lot of people , you know , kind of felt that way , 
but they had a lot of , uh , uh , counseling groups that use some of the episodes as , 
 oh , really . 
 you know , that they  called  interaction between people and  sort of  to use as , uh , as a way of getting people to talk about their problems , 
and that sort of thing .
uh , we kind of , 
uh ,   our t v viewing has , uh , slowed down a little bit since our daughter came along , 
so , uh , 
 that tends to , uh , put a cramp in your viewing , because by the time you get through it's , uh , very little t v time left . 
you are too tired 
oh , it's better to spend time with your kids , i think though , than glued in front of the t v anyway . 
that's right . 
probably more worthwhile . 
i don't think there's as many good things to watch as there used to be , really . 
i don't think there were , uh , 
that i continuously like to watch as much as i used to .
i , uh , you know , 
 be able to name ten shows or so , you know , that i felt were worth my time to watch , 
but , uh , i  uh , you know  very seldom like to watch  you know  those , 
there's a couple now that i tend to want to watch . 
i like , uh , home improvement shows like bob vela's , uh , home again on saturday morning , 
it's like this old house , 
 but uh , it's on 
instead of being on p b s it's on regular t v . 
but , uh , it's kind of interesting because they renovate an old house 
i have seen parts of that before , 
it is interesting . 
so i like to watch that 
and uh , some things on p b s i like to watch 
but , uh . 
do you watch sports much on t v ? 
but , uh , baseball to me is a little hard to watch on t v ,
it's slow . 
it's so slow that you just get bored , you know , 
and a baseball game going back and forth , you know watching it . 
but , i usually , 
or pro team that i am fond of , i usually will sit and watch that . 
but , uh , that's the  , 
we are like that 
and occasionally we will , like if we do not have anything to do or kind of bored and we just want to sit in the house or something ,
but , uh , 
it's pretty slow . 
it's kind of like , 
do you wa , 
we went to the movies a lot on weekends and watch them at home , because there's just , 
i think that that's what more people are doing 
and i think that's , you know , 
as t v , 
i think the less good shows being on t v has caused a lot of people to do that , uh , you know , get more movies and watch . 
i know we have done that too in the past , uh , 
we do not do it quite as much now , cause our baby will not let us watch them . 
but , uh , you know , and try to watch . 
do you have cable t v ? 
no , uh , 
we do not either . 
we live in , 
i thought we were the only ones  ,
we , uh , 
the , uh , development we moved into was , 
they have it on one si , like right across the street from us , 
 but when they built our section did not put it in 
and we have been there about two years now . 
 and they still do not have it 
so  ,
i have contacted them about this 
and they say that well , it's , 
they look , 
where , uh , the most houses will be , 
 and so uh , they look 
and put ,
well , we had it for awhile 
and it just seemed like we never watched it 
  we did not have the movie channels , 
we just had all the normal ones ,
and we just never watched any of them , 
we kept a log for a month of every time we watched it 
and it seemed like we did not watch even half an hour , 
 um . yeah . 
 so we decided to just cancel it . 
it does improve the reception a little bit though , 
that's the only thing . 
 uh , an antenna , a really good antenna 
and , uh , it's really helped , you know , ours 
and it's not been too bad . 
i have not really missed it that much , 
there's certain things that i have , that i want to see , you know , occasionally , like a football game , a college game or something that happens to be on cable , or some old movie , 
but the , uh , 
i have not been bothered by it too much . 
well , it was nice talking to you . 
and i probably would , uh , target , uh , 
that's probably a major one . 
i think , uh , individually , uh , just by the vast number of people there are , i think cars are also a major contributor to it . 
vehicles .
because , uh , there's a lot of commercial vehicles out there ,
 huh  .
i think uh , one of them would probably generate enough for three cars . 
but that's not , 
and i think it can be resolved uh , if they really let go with ,
and they haven't released it yet . 
i think there's a lot of hold back , uh , because ,
and , uh , it's , 
 well , it   , 
you have some children . 
i have five in the kitchen at the moment . 
you need to shut the door , please . 
shut the door right now . 
we have the air conditioner running . 
what do you need ? 
i'm on the phone .
you may . 
and they keep turning the tape recorder up besides .
oh , okay .
do you watch children 
or do you , 
my own 
and i have , uh , two that i'm tending for the summer .
well , that's interesting . 
um , is there anything , 
they cause more noise pollution than air pollution .
 well , temporarily they do . 
that's right , 
then we get out of that phase ,
but , um , i think another , 
you can tell when you go around cities , you can smell specific things specific industries . 
oh , yes . 
i remember being , 
i grew up in new jersey 
 and , uh , i can remember the smell of newark .
 and it's the type of industry , you know , which obviously if you can smell it , it's in the air . 
well , i know , uh , uh , in michigan , uh , the way they used to take care of the trash is they would incinerate it , 
and the fumes from the incineration was a terrible pollutant to the air . 
and , um , of course , now , 
but it's not gone . 
and when they , 
and you bury it 
and it's not gone either , because it has untold ramifications . 
then it just gets into the soil and into the water .
and they're destroying us , 
we really have to do more , 
so i think the cockroach will evolve , uh , safely .
so they say .
i think we've got to do more with the recycling . 
i'm really glad to see that there's more of that happening . 
but there's not enough . 
and we need expert cooperation . 
well , it's a , 
we're getting , 
at least they're starting , you know . 
 education of the , 
so at least they're moving that direction . 
uh , and we're hard to teach . 
it's probably going to be a generation or two before , 
and the children are being taught in the schools it'll be , you know , on down the road this is going to be passed on , which is good . 
uh , of course , uh , we would like to see it accelerated because , uh , of the critical nature of it . 
the learning of it and the , 
just to , um , think that way , we have to be in that thought pattern and able to , um , motivate ourselves to , um , uh , do what is right for the atmosphere . 
um , i think we're all contributors . 
i mean , every human being that lives is a contributor ,
i think you're right , 
education is a big thing 
and as we educate them individually what they can do , people become more aware of the things in industry too that are causing problems 
they'll work towards solving those problems more too . um , 
well , hopefully it can be resolved within a shorter time frame than we have seen it done in the past .
you know , i mean , 
just a minute and i'll turn it up . 
i'll turn it up in a minute , honey , when i'm done . 
so um , it's just , um , very critical , i think at this point to ,
well , i think science has come a long way to making it so that it's possible to find ways to solve the problem .
uh , in the grade school ,
i think they teach it a lot in science .
in science , 
i would think that that's where it would come through . 
what grade level would that be ? 
would that be , um , perhaps ,
well , i mean , are they starting , though , with the children that are so , 
their little minds are like sponges 
and they can really  ,
 i think they are starting probably in the first grade . 
you know , they're hearing somewhat about it . 
um , i know , uh , target has their program to make kids more aware of it 
oh , okay . 
uh , kind of a little newspaper thing 
oh , i see . 
help fight the pollution . 
oh , that's wonderful . 
well , i'm sure that , uh , perhaps they're the leaders , you know , 
and others will pick up on their example and carry it , uh , further . 
you know , because , uh , thoughts are , 
well , you know , like mcdonald's has changed back and forth between paper and foam and that kind of thing , 
and they do all these studies on which ones pollute more , 
and then there's the paper and plastic bag question . 
 uh , do you ha , 
are you a musician yourself ? 
i don't play an instrument . 
what kind of singing do you like to do ? 
 oh , pretty much anything . 
um , have you been singing a long time 
or have you studied ? 
oh , yeah . 
a long time out , all through college and everything i was in the choirs . 
and i've had some classical vocal training . 
oh , really ? 
oh , great . 
uh , in germany . 
oh , that's wonderful . 
um , well , i likewise sang in high school and in college in choirs , 
and then i didn't sing in a choral group , um , until after i was , uh , married , 
and i sang in a couple of , uh , community choirs , and then um , waited for a while , 
and now for about the last eight years i've sung in a church choir here ,
oh , yeah . 
and , um , so i enjoy ,
a soprano . 
yeah , so am i . 
do you , 
and , uh , what kind of music do you like to sing ? 
um , you were saying you had classical training . 
oh , well , 
as far as opera goes , i'm , i think most fond of verdi . 
i've been listening to , um , uh , some advertisements for madam butterfly , 
and i'm wondering if you have ever done anything like that , 
i haven't done , uh , 
i'd love to , 
but , um , that's , uh , puccini , i think , 
um , madam butterfly was , um , 
it's been two or three years ago now , 
and then i went to see that , 
it was particularly well , 
the acting was particularly nice , i thought , 
and , um , so , 
um , you don't play , um , an instrument 
i think that's always a good instrument for anybody who sings or does , you know , some other kind of instrument , 
i think piano is always good background , 
um , i played piano five until i graduated from college , 
and , uh , then i was a piano teacher for a while while my husband was in graduate school , 
so , um , that was the instrument both of my children started on , 
but neither of them stayed with it .
one of them , um , turned into a violist , 
and the other one and percussion , 
um , but the , 
i think that the piano background is very , um , useful , 
and , um , i'm sure that for you , it would have been great to be able to accompany yourself ,
oh , yeah . 
do you have any other kind of music that you like ? 
um , oh , i like to listen to all different kinds of music . 
i have a , 
i used to work with a fellow who had , um , 
although this was a computer company , he had his , uh , p h d in musical , uh , i guess it was in composition , actually , from university of north texas , 
and , uh , yet when i would go into his , 
it may be country , 
it might be classical , 
it might be rock , you know 
it was just , he said that just about what you said , that he just liked all kinds of music . 
and for me to hear that somebody is , 
there's , you know , some of the really totally country stuff , i don't really particularly like 
um , do you have any plans to , uh , do anything with your music in the near future 
well , i have like , we , 
i wish i could 
 but i don't really know how to go about it without having a degree 
um  , 
i know that there are , if you're interested in choral singing , 
i'm not sure where ,
but i do know that some communities have ,
um , it's not terribly demanding . 
you might have to audition , 
but that probably wouldn't be a problem , 
but , um , there usually , you know , 
that they take tours and things like that 
and you get to know 
i think well , that's one reason why i have enjoyed my choir so much , is that not only do we sing wonderful music , 
but we've gotten to know each other quite well , um , a social level , 
you know , 
that's good . 
so , whereabouts in ,
oh , i'm in flower mound . 
flower mound , 
well , i'm in plano , 
so , um , we're just not too far apart , actually . 
that's pretty close . 
it was funny , um , uh , 
it's , you know , 
i talk to people all over , uh , texas , um , and only one person outside uh , of the state , 
so i'm always asking where in the state , you know , the person is from if they're in texas . 
um , do you have a family ? 
i was wondering if your spouse , 
or you know , if you had , uh , other musical people in your family . 
i'm sorry ? 
uh , if you have other people in your family who are also musical . 
do you come by it naturally ? 
were your parents that musical ? 
that often is the case , um , 
the , you know , 
sometimes it will skip . 
like my husband is not musical at all , 
but his mother is very musical , 
um , and his children are very musical , 
so you never know where the talent is going to show up , i guess , sometimes . 
i think , 
 well , i've enjoyed talking with you ,
and , um , maybe we'll talk again . 
all right , 
why did you check music ? 
oh , because i know a little bit about music , you know , 
so i thought that i would put that , 
plus i like , uh , to listen to music . 
what kind of music do you enjoy ? 
um , i really enjoy the oldies , 
is what i really listen to most of the time . 
like what kind of oldies ? 
usually in the fifties . 
i'm not really sure , 
i think it's a fifties , sixties , and seventies station that i listen to . 
they have the same kind of station down here , 
and when i listen to music most of the time that's what i listen to . 
oh , really . 
i don't know a lot of the , um , uh , musicians' names or the singers' names , 
but i know a lot of the old songs . 
we just got a disk the other day that was a , um , disk of nat king cole's greatest hits 
oh , yeah . 
 and it is excellent . 
it's about twenty of his greatest hits on it . 
it's really an excellent , excellent c d . 
we were really quite pleased with it . 
it was good . 
um , do you listen , 
have you heard of nat king cole ? 
well , um , um , do you play any musical instruments or anything . 
um , i played the accordion for seven years 
 and i played the clarinet for seven years also . 
and then in fourth grade i started the clarinet , 
and i played that all through high school . 
like , so you're in the marching band and stuff in high school . 
i played the baritone horn 
oh , okay . 
so , and , my wife played flute in high school . 
and then in concert band i played the bass clarinet . 
actually that's exactly the same thing my exwife did .
she played the clarinet 
and then she played bass clarinet during concert band . 
oh , really . 
i like the low notes better than the high notes . 
we didn't have any bass clarinet players 
so i asked him if i could play it , because i was first clarinet , 
and they end up playing a lot of the high notes , 
and i don't care for the sound of the high notes . 
so i asked him if i could play the bass clarinet , 
he didn't have anyone to play it . 
so i played it , 
and i really enjoyed it . 
um . well , i like it , 
i like the low instruments better , too . 
um , do you go to listen to much live music ? 
pardon me ? 
do you listen to much live music , like concerts or things there ? 
we're going to one here in a couple of weeks . 
um , um , i don't know if you follow broadway , much , 
but , uh , michael crawford was in phantom of the opera on broadway . 
you know , you know whom i'm talking about ? 
and he's coming to dallas on the twentyninth , 
and we got a big group going down to hear him sing a bunch of , uh , andrew lloyd webber's music . 
so that'll be good . 
oh , wow . 
my sons are kind of into broadway . 
my older son is at columbia in new york city , 
and he's been to see phantom , and les miserables and bunch of other things up there , 
i would love to be able to go see les miserables . 
and he does it , 
he can go if they get sixteen dollar tickets 
oh , my gosh . 
and one of the , uh , 
the last time they went up , a friend of his wanted to go , 
and chris didn't want to go , 
so the friend david went , 
and he went and bought one of the low priced student tickets , 
and they gave him the seat that normally belongs to john bel john .
it's his house seat . 
that's under his control , 
and he said it was a great seat . 
holy smoke . 
so , they've been to see it several times . 
oh , i would love to go see that , and cats 
i would love to be able to go see those . 
would they , 
don't any of those ever come to pittsburgh ? 
and i go to college , 
i had just gotten , 
i just graduated from college in may , 
and so i really didn't have the chance or the money to go see them . 
well , we're kind of , you know , 
well , i saw two road shows of les mis , 
and they were both excellent . 
so if it comes to pittsburgh in the road shows , and i think they have three different companies that tour the u s , um , you should go see it , because it's really outstanding . 
my brother doesn't even like that kind of stuff , 
and he went to new york , 
a bunch of , 
there was like twenty students from high school that went , 
and he went to new york with them , 
and he saw it , 
and he said it was the best thing he'd ever seen 
well , i think it's just incredible . 
and then , you know , those , um , two guys who wrote les mis wrote a new show call miss saigon .
oh really . 
and my son and his friend were in a lottery to get tickets to it , 
and they got tickets for the opening night . 
and they went to it , 
and they said it was great . 
oh , see now , i like that type of stuff . 
but my fiancee doesn't really like it . 
he's more into the new wave music , 
like depressed mode , 
i guess , i don't know either , you know , 
i don't too much , 
but my younger son listens to some of that kind of stuff . 
oh , i don't know , uh , 
really weird names , like the dead milkman , 
or i don't know . 
oh , it's you know , really weird stuff , he likes , 
so he listens to new wave 
and you listen to the oldies . 
that's kind 
well , that's good though , you know . 
it's good to cover all the bases there . 
i'll listen to anything basically , except i don't like the real hard metal rock . 
i just refuse to listen to that at all . 
i'll even listen to country . 
i like some country . 
well , now we don't listen to much country , 
but we just , 
at the same night we bought that nat king cole album , we bought garth brooks' album , no fences . 
that is excellent . 
do you like randy travis ? 
i mean , i've probably heard him , 
but i've never bought any of his music . 
garth brooks is probably the only country album we have , 
or , no wait , my wife bought an album of hank williams' greatest hits . 
oh , hank williams junior ? 
so these are a bunch of old recordings . 
she bought that the same night we bought the nat king cole and the garth brooks . 
oh , yeah , 
well , those should be good albums . 
it is pretty good . 
she likes it . 
if you have the chance , 
it's a little too country for me , 
it's a little too , uh , ronky tonk or something . 
i like the garth brooks album a lot . 
it's pretty good , 
um , i don't know , 
maybe you wouldn't like randy travis . 
he's really country himself 
 but , uh , i really enjoy listening to his music . 
which of his albums do you think is the best ? 
oh , i don't know . 
if i were you , i would get the greatest hits album 
but , um , we have , i think , four records of his . 
i can't , you know , name the names of them off hand 
 but we have , i think , all his records so far , 
and all my brothers and sisters listen to them , even the ones that like the heavy metal 
you know , maybe if you did like hank williams and garth , you know , maybe you would enjoy uh , randy travis . 
well , one of his albums , because we do kind of like it , 
so , so it's good . 
um , do you know any , oh , 
i was going to say do you know any other country singers that you would , you know , i mean , the women , do you like the    , 
in fact we have a   album  . . . 
now then i think that 
are you there ? 
all right . 
do you have any one that has been in a nursing home ? 
uh , well , only um , my grandmother , but for a very short time . 
um , in a nursing home for , uh , recovery from a broken hip 
but , um , that , 
physical therapy was there and whatever , 
but i think , in visiting her there , um , it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in , uh , weren't there mentally . 
uh , she was probably the only person in the , um , whole nursing home that , uh , still had all of her mental facilities about her . 
so uh , that was very disheartening . 
well , what do you think can be done about that ? 
i mean , what can we do , 
oh , yeah , 
it's really hard , i guess . 
um , of , uh , take care of your elders , i guess . 
uh , my dad's mother is an invalid , 
and she lives with my aunt and uncle , 
and they care for her , you know , all around the clock . 
though because of arthritis , she's just unable to get out of bed . 
so , i guess , you know , there's that family commitment . 
um , i know that my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can . um , 
well , i can remembe , 
of course i'm 
we did not have to call on someone else , 
and i feel , 
no , you tell me how you feel about , 
well probably , i think , as long as the person's able um , to understand what's going on around them 
and i think , you know , my grandmother right now is still able to walk around , 
and she's still able uh , to do some things for herself , though she gets meals on wheels 
certainly d , 
i worked with an agency in west texas it's where they really started this concept of meals on wheels 
 and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly . 
if they didn't have to , you know , go into a kitchen 
my mother expired just a little over a year ago , 
and we had finally , 
she didn't want to live with either my sister or me 
 but found a retirement center for her , 
and it was beautiful 
and they didn't even have nursing care there . 
so until , 
as long as mother was , you know 
and she was with people with whom she enjoyed . 
i think , you know , it's really funny , 
i have two grandmothers still alive , 
and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible . 
she's like openly told people . 
she's always been very good about knowing , 
yes , she's eightynine , 
and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible , because it's her home . 
but when the time comes , um , and she can't do things 
and she has to be cared for , whatever , she would prefer , and she's actually said this , to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment , uh , probably with like a living space and a bedroom 
yes , sir . 
but if she wants to go to a meal , she can go down the hallway , uh , to a room where there's a cafeteria 
 and there's other people there , 
and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company . 
being a widow 
i have just recently retired , 
and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to . 
so , uh , mother had the little kitchenette 
 and she could do all these fine things that she just , had a microwave , had to pop 
now this is wonderful . 
but when it came time for a full meal , then mother was able to go with people 
uh , the elderly are invalids , i think that they should be able to interact with other people 
oh , i think so . 
i mean , um , see , i know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house , 
and my parents actually said , you know , that they may have to take their end , sometime , because , you know , my grandma , she says who she wants to live with , 
she's pretty , you know , 
she lets people know , 
all right , ron . 
uh , number one , i am one hundred percent for total gun control . 
total gun control . 
i am not a member of the national rifle association 
and , uh , i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate 
and i really feel that we have to do something in order uh , to    , 
i agree something should be done , 
but i don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons , because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct will have access to weapons from somewhere 
and that means they'll always have an advantage over us 
and , uh , they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself . 
now , you know , i agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter 
matter of fact , if i find a fly running around in the house , i pick him up and carry him outdoors .
i don't even hit him with a flyswatter , 
so i've , uh , gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and killing and that sort of thing . 
but uh , personally , that we do need some weapons available to most of the people . 
most of the people really are , uh , honest and , uh , worthy of carrying on their lives properly . 
uh , i'm sort of in line thinking in terms , 
i don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon . 
i mean there's nothing wrong with that . 
do you see anything wrong with that ? 
i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available . and the types of the weapons . 
i mean there is 
i'm against this , uh , automatic and semiautomatic stuff . 
i don't think we should have access to those . 
and , uh , maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun control . 
that's really not what i meant . 
but , i mean we need control . 
we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening 
and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out 
and they're not , uh , acquiring weapons for illicit use . 
uh , that is not good . 
there's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms . 
as a matter of fact , uh , there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who , uh , brought to me a target from a rifle that he , uh , pretty well , halfway designed 
and he put together the , uh , the bullets in it 
 and he was showing me that at a hundred yards , he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards . 
now , see from a technical point of view , that is something that our military people need to know about . 
so there are other interesting , uh , facets in guns and weapons . 
this is a , uh , bolt action rifle , i think he has . 
and he has done other things to the way the , uh , barrel sits in uh , the wood part of it . 
and , uh , he designed the bullets themselves 
and he has fantastic accuracy . 
just from a technical point of view , that interests me . not to kill anybody with it or anything with it , but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate . 
all right , 
you sound like you're into the technology of it , which is , 
yeah , i agree . 
they are all hunters 
 and , you know , they don't appreciate my stand , 
it's just  , i think that's totally outrageous . 
what's happening is people are losing , 
they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue . 
and the issue ,
uh , i think something will happen . 
so , beverly , what do you think about drug testing ? 
i think in some professions it's , uh , essential . things like pilots and things that involve the safety of other people particularly . 
we got a lot of mistakes here , uh , in the maryland , baltimore area because of , uh , train conductors 
i think we've had two terrible accidents here recently , 
and also on , um , just like , i bet you within five days uh , a dump truck , where the driver was , uh , high on marijuana , 
i guess he smoked marijuana for lunch and , uh , drove his truck up the back of two small cars in a tunnel that goes underneath uh , a river that leads into the chesapeake bay 
oh , my goodness , 
 and it would , 
that tied up traffic for a long time , 
everybody died , 
the fire was terrible , 
it was awful . 
so , yeah , 
i think you're right , 
i , i think if you're in a field , 
but then you know , who would test all truck drivers 
that is a problem 
and every time before they get into a vehicle 
 i think , looking at athletes being drug tested 
i don't know , 
 i think the random drug testing , i don't know in my own mind if it has reduced the athletes from taking drugs , because they're still being caught 
that make sense ? 
and then , uh , i think , 
it would be good . 
i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it 
i don't know . 
however , here in dallas 
 and he had been suspended a couple of times because of drug testing , 
and he was on probation , 
he was to the point that if he was caught another time that he would lose his contract , 
and they wouldn't have to pay him , 
and the mavericks wanted to get rid of him , 
but they couldn't afford to replace him and still pay his contract 
 and , uh , just recently he was , uh , missing from practice 
and whenever he missed like that , usually he had some kind of problem 
so they were able to 
get rid of him . 
and so , in his case , he lost his whole career , 
he's been in the paper , in jail , 
and it's just been awful 
 and talk about a terrible role model , 
that's a terrible thi , you know , 
it's really funny though , um , 
i guess , my dad was hit by a drunk driver who was also high 
oh , my goodness . 
 and , um , though he's alive today and everything worked out fine , it happened about two blocks from the high school 
and a friend came and got me , 
and i was there , 
and i could smell the dope , 
and i could see the beer cans from the guy that hit him 
 and nothing ever happened , 
oh , that's terrible . 
but i really , uh , 
and drugs have , uh , long lasting effects 
 and i guess when i younger i was , um , probably a little more liberal on the subject . 
i think most of us are . 
but as soon as that happened , 
i guess when i was eighteen years old , if you'd have asked me , i'd have thought it was fine 
 but by the time i was nineteen my opinion had totally changed . 
if you know someone , 
for example we have , uh , some friends whose son was driving home from work , was hit head on by a drunk driver 
the drunk and his wife in the car were killed , 
and , uh , bobby missed his whole junior year of high school 
he went through surgery after surgery 
um . traction and all that terrible stuff . 
 and for a long time they didn't even know whether he'd be normal again . 
and he , 
as far as his athletics , he's lost all of that . 
he , uh , has been tutored , 
and he'll catch up in school and everything , 
but , he's still not back where he was . 
i don't think somebody , 
he may never have all those motor skills back . 
you don't have the right to interfere in somebody else's life . 
you know , i wouldn't even say ruin somebody's life . 
another thing that we saw here recently . a train track ran through 
 and one boy who had been drinking decided for some stupid reason to try to play with the train . 
well , the train missed him , 
but , uh , like a metal thing sticking out , hit him in the head 
he was in a coma for 
he's out of the coma now , 
and eventually they think he will come back , 
but you don't know that , 
 but he's lost , 
he was an outstanding football player , 
so , what kind of a house do you live in ? 
i'm uh , in a ranch . 
a , uh , 
it was about , uh , sixteen hundred square feet when i bought it , 
and , uh , it's about two thousand square feet now , 
but it's one of those typical , uh , ranches that you find around here . 
oh , it's , uh , probably built in the late fifties 
so it's not , um , what you would find , uh , where you live . 
but , uh , for the older , uh , ranch homes it's pretty typical i guess . 
well , our home is , uh , for our area it's probably one of the lower income homes out here . 
 uh , most of the homes that they're building , 
well , i shouldn't say all of them , 
but most of them now are up in the millions of dollars . 
oh yeah , 
how many square feet do you have ? 
we have got about , uh , i'd say about twentyfour hundred . 
four bedrooms ? 
uh , we've got five bedrooms ,
five bedrooms . 
a bedroom for my mother , 
and , uh , 
 uh , what we call a sunroom 
when we added four hundred square feet to our house 
oh , that's great . 
so that , 
well , this house is very comfortable . 
we've got two living areas 
and that's the thing i probably like the most about it . 
how many stories ? 
just one ? 
it's just one story . 
it's a fox and jacobs home . 
how are they built ? 
um , we've been real happy with it . 
i've heard that , 
i've heard the construction is pretty good on fox and jacobs . 
of course , i'm not a carpenter or anything like that . 
and this is under something 
but i mean it doesn't give you trouble ? 
no cracked slab or anything like that ? 
 all right . 
we've been real lucky . 
and is it , um , a natural gas and , 
you know what i miss though ? 
oh , yeah . 
i sure wish they could build basements in homes in texas . 
i've heard a lot of people say that . 
that's for sure . 
uh , we have an attic that we've just put , you know , plywood over the beams and things up in the attic 
and so that ,
so you , 
but certainly not , 
can you stand up in it ? 
i mean you really couldn't use it for a room . 
so you have a probably a more pitched roof than is typical around here . 
ours is pitched so shallow that you , uh , don't get much room in the attic . 
uh , we've got , you know , 
i'll store all our christmas stuff and whatever else junk up there . 
so , five bedrooms and two family t , 
two living areas . 
we have a living room and dining room at the front of the house , 
and then we have the , uh , family room , kitchen , and playroom 
in fact , i really enjoy the playroom 
you would think that would not be a real bonus , you know , to a house , 
but of all the rooms in the house i'd say that was the one that's been really nice to have .
isn't it funny how families end up living in one room in the house most of the time . 
i think that's true . 
 you c , 
probably our family room is the biggest . uh , 
some people , i mean , 
families seem to migrate towards one room and carry on most of their activities there , 
and , uh , uh , we have one room that we never use . 
i mean might as well not even heat and cool it . 
well , that's kind of the way our living room and dining room is , 
but it is nice to have it because uh , with our size of family it's nice to know that there's one that's always straight and clean if you have someone come 
so  , 
so you've been fairly happy with it . 
how long have you been in it ? 
seventeen years . 
boy , it doesn't seem that long 
but it is because we , uh , came to this area about the same time .
we've been in the house that we're living in . 
oh , wow . 
and the principal feature i like about ours is that it's pier and beam . 
oh , uhhuh . 
yours is a slab i assume . 
ours is a pier and beam which has allowed me to go under it and do a whole lot of different things that i could not have done if it was slab . 
i've done a lot of electrical and plumbing and other work by myself and saved a lot of money that i couldn't have done if the house was on a slab . 
well , that's interesting . 
but that's because it's so old . 
it's thirtyfive , thirtysix years old when they used to build like that , 
and , uh , 
well , my husband wouldn't do that anyway . 
that's his , 
i know , 
he's not a handy , 
worst thing in life is to have to repair something . 
i , on the other hand , 
and , uh , i've gotten good at it which uh , you start to take pleasure in it .
well , uh , that's great . 
we just kind of save everything for when his dad comes to visit 
and then he does all the repairing , you know , 
my dad is actually , uh , 
um , thinking about it , some of the ways i try and keep up on current events is , uh , i enjoy reading the newspaper , but , uh , quite often don't have time to read all of the newspaper , 
and so , uh , i enjoy watching some of the t v highlights and also , uh , some of the news periodicals , uh , weekly magazines , 
and , uh , at work i also have , uh , management summary reports that , uh , give basically a lot of the current events . 
uh , how about yourself ? 
well , i'm like you . 
i like to read the paper 
but i basically don't do it every day , 
and um , i usually watch , uh , either good morning , america or the today show , every morning 
whatever i'm doing , i watch that . 
i usually watch the news , either at , you know , early evening or at ten o'clock 
 so i get it from t v a lot . 
i read time magazine .
um , that's one i read pretty regularly . 
oh , yeah . 
 and , uh . 
you think that that's , uh , pretty adequate coverage 
and you get . 
then you can just sort of have pictures to go along with it or something , because really , i've thought lately , there's nothing new in the time magazine . 
oh , okay . 
you know , it's , basically you've heard everything 
 and , uh , you might get a little more thorough , uh , account of something , 
but really , um , i don't know . 
so i get most of mine from television 
i would say . 
um , i found out too , that , uh , quite often if i see something on television that i want more indepth , uh , understanding newsweek , can give you a better and more thorough coverage of what i've heard on t v , 
but , uh , um , i found out that also on t v that you can scan through a whole lot of different things on c n n 
that are happening , 
and you can read some more about it if you want to . 
um , i found out , though that , 
or i feel that a lot of the stuff on t v and the newspapers is negative . 
there's an awful lot of negative news or bad news . 
and it'd be refreshing once in a while to hear some good news . 
and , uh . 
 and i think there's an attempt to do that . 
you know , i think people , 
there's a mild attempt for that , 
but i think we basically associate news with bad news 
we do . 
i think our concept of news isn't necessarily events that happen . 
it's more negative , like you said . 
but , on t v i think , they try to throw in good stuff , 
but uh , it doesn't sway the vote . 
i've heard an interesting comment also that , uh , with budget cuts and , uh , expenses the way they are that it's affected the news media , whereas before they would be able to have a indepth analysis or , uh , investigative reporting , on certain topics and issues , 
but that takes time , 
that takes an awful lot of money and commitment , 
and quite often it's a lot easier to listen to the police scanners or what they call ambulance chasing 
 and you know , it's lot easy to go after and follow a fire department or a police officer , and , uh , find out news from that as opposed to going out and finding good things , 
so . i don't know , 
i guess the economy is effecting also the news media 
 and we have to pay that price , 
but , uh , i don't know , 
it's interesting , 
and i think that nowadays with communications the way they are also , that we can see global events happening as they occur 
you know , the war last winter was certainly a good example of that 
we saw , 
you know , twenty years ago , thirty years ago , we wouldn't have been able to have that privilege to view that . 
i mean , you know , i remember , well , just the things that are covered . 
i remember watching the world series during the earthquake ,
oh , yes . 
 i mean , you know , that was just so phenomenal to see this stadium shake 
i mean , it's like , that was just something 
oh , yeah . 
and then , of course , one thing i think , too , is with tele , 
any kind of recent painting you've done , uh , yourself ? 
have you done any recently ? 
well , we , uh , remodeled a bathroom .
and the other project we've done around here is , uh , we've remodeled all our closets 
that's quite a chore . 
i imagine it did . 
did you have that done professionally 
or did you do that yourself ? 
did it myself . 
did you enjoy that ? 
oh , that's fun . 
we just recently , uh , had our boys' room , 
our two oldest boys share a room , 
and uh , the paint has , uh , kind of faded and deteriorated , 
and so we decided to paint their room and put up wallpaper and border and so forth , 
and , uh , looks quite good . 
we were quite pleased with the result . 
is this a project you did yourself ? 
and , uh . 
what brought about the fading of the paint ? 
just sun exposure ? 
but , uh , boys will be boys , 
and there were crayon marks on there 
oh , okay , 
latex paint ? 
pardon me ? 
it was latex paint , 
and that's , uh , what we put back on there , was a latex paint . 
plus , uh , they had bunk beds , 
and uh , got a nice marker and got up on the ceiling and decided to draw pictures .
on the ceiling ? 
and , uh , you scrub and you scrub , 
but you can't it all off . 
that's true . 
and so , that's one of the reasons why we painted , 
and , uh . 
what kind of paint did you use on the ceiling ? 
we used a flat , latex paint 
 and in the bedroom , as i understand , that's , uh , one of the better type of paints to have 
and it , uh , turned out real , real well . 
seems like , uh , we've done some remodeling of some , uh , rental houses that we have 
 and it appears as though that , uh , oh , in the fifties or sixties when some of these houses were built , uh , they used a lot of , uh , semigloss type enamel for ceiling paints 
 and that was a little difficult to cover with today's paints ,
we had an occasion , uh , where we had to do some sealing 
oh , you had to prime it 
you had pretty good luck with one coat type paint ? 
you use a particular brand or anything ? 
well , i like to use this sears , uh , the ten year guarantee or the fifteen year guarantee . 
weather beater type stuff ? 
and the reason being is once i painted , i don't want to have to go and do it another five or seven years later 
 but , uh , 
and , uh , we're quite satisfied with that 
 and occasionally you can watch for it and get it on sale , 
and we do that . 
in fact , i was just reading an article , 
you mentioned painting your bathroom . 
i read an article recently that , uh , you have to be very careful on the kind of paint you put on the ceiling in your bathroom because it does tend bathroom . 
it's a lot like , uh , wall paper . 
that's true . 
and , uh , did you have any problems with that 
well , the particular bathroom that we did is a half bath , 
so we didn't have a problem with that . 
oh , good . 
uh , i've , uh , have never experienced that type of a problem 
oh , good . 
neither have i .
so , you shouldn't have a problem with it . 
oh , good . 
they're pretty well refined today 
and sears is one of the better ones . 
i've used , uh , many a gallon of them , myself . 
uh , have you ever used an oil base paint ? 
why do you use that ? 
new at this , 
uh , primarily because it seems to be a little more , uh , well , let's say 
it seems to hold up a little bit better towards the nicks and dings 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , a variance even though it's the same color . 
well , that's good , 
so it's worked out pretty well for us . 
uh , have you ever done any painting outside ? 
painted a couple of houses . 
uh , recently this summer we painted a , uh , out building , which is a shed that we have on the , 
where does she live ? 
uh , on rutherford . 
rutherford . 
i don't know that . 
it's , uh , corner of new york 
it's , oh , oh , south and , okay , 
i know the area . 
that's kind of on the other side of town , 
oh , okay . 
 oh , well , i've got one in college .
whether it is possible to have an honest government . i'm beginning to think it's not . 
what about you ? .
 i don't think under the way the system is right now , it is . 
i don't either . 
i think , 
uh , even if people have good intentions , i think to a certain extent , you know . 
the ultimate power , ultimately corrupts . 
it seems like , uh , maybe more of them come in with good intentions , 
but it's just so enticing , 
and  a lot of  corners being cut and the special deals available , because they're  in on the know   , you know .
i don't know if , 
i just don't , uh , 
i mean , you even see people on a small scale cheating when they have certain positions , 
little bitty positions in your own home town , and they'll cheat somehow or , you know , bend the rules , use their power . 
so maybe it's just man's nature .
on our county commissioners 
 and there were several counties , uh , including the one i was in , that lost every one of their county commissioners 
oh , my word . 
oh , wow . 
what were they doing taking some , 
 oh , they were taking kickbacks . 
oh , no .
 oh , gosh . 
just a little here , a little there . 
major amount here , a major amount there . 
but i think there was something like , you know , thirty or forty commissioners that ended up going to jail . 
um . we haven't had that big a scandal in arlington , 
but we do have the people that work for the convention center were falsifying records . 
in other words , they'd go out and have a big , lavish dinner and then put somebody's name down that they supposedly had entertained , 
but that person wasn't even anywhere near there , you know . 
some of them weren't even in the same city . 
one of them had cancer and died 
and i mean , that was our biggest scandal for the last few years , i think . 
uh , that's small scale . 
i don't know , you know , 
i really don't know what could be done . uh , 
 i don't either . uh , to make it totally honest . 
uh , i think there's always going to be some way somebody can cut a corner , uh . 
however , the things that have 
that's right . 
we could almost not afford such terrible corruption . 
the coverups and , 
i think that , uh , reagan and bush were up to their necks in that iran contra thing , 
and it kind of makes you feel bad that the top people in your country would be lying to you like that , 
but , uh , 
 uh , i don't know . 
uh , i'd like to believe that there is some way that our political people would really go there and look out for our interests . 
i think that's what upsets me worse than , that they're getting a little , you know , uh , on the side 
that's right , 
but they stay there , 
and this would be for the best for the nation overall . 
you're right , 
it's just a , 
i don't know . 
i guess that's where they stay uh , in , 
they try to stay in office . 
but they always please the money people too . 
they need money so much , because they're constantly having to run , 
and then you think , well , if it was longer terms 
 that's true . 
boy , it is a big problem , 
but i think most people are kind of depressed and cynical about government now ,
don't you ? 
i don't think that anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government . 
i know . 
it's really terrible . 
i mean , there was a time , i mean where , i remember when i was real young , i just loved harry truman . 
i thought he was great .
oh , you know , i had , 
some of them seemed like kind of , uh , heroic people . 
well i wonder if they really were ,
well , okay , uh , 
most of the , uh , commercial television these days , i'm just a little bit sick of . 
uh , in fact , i don't watch hardly any , uh , television at all with , uh , my other activities . 
uh , between my family and my church et cetera , et cetera , well 
now i do watch the discover channel and some on channel thirteen 
but , uh , 
oh , do you , 
oh , i'm sort of a , well , 
i'm different from that . 
i'm sort of a movie buff . 
i go to a couple of movies a week , sometimes , 
but honestly i'm selfemployed , 
and a lot of times i will , uh , go out and take a lunch hour , go to lunch from like twelve to two , go to a movie and just come back to my office . 
i don't blame you . 
but , uh , i do it , 
it's like entertainment , 
and i'm pretty much of a junk movie watcher by myself . 
if i take my wife , then we see something a little nicer , you know . 
but , uh , 
and my kids are all sort of movie watchers . 
you know , we've always gone to a lot of movies in our life . 
but i would just as soon , uh , be doing something else , 
it's just that my kids are gone now , 
and my wife's a school teacher 
and sometimes , she doesn't get home until about seven o'clock . 
so , you know , i'll come in like five thirty or six , 
and i'll turn on the tube 
and sometimes i set there all evening . 
well , it , 
sometimes if it's real good , 
like there's been more than one evening that i've , uh , caught , uh , every animal show that evening on , uh , on the discover channel . 
you bet , 
and , uh , because you know , they're documentaries and they're . 
well , that's an interesting channel . 
oh , you bet , 
in fact i'm glad that it's part of our , uh , basic cable package . 
that's great . 
but , uh , 
you know , i've just never spent any time watching it 
and , you know 
but i , 
oh , oh , me too . 
watch my dallas cowboys . 
i watched them to halftime before i left 
and i left at halftime 
 and started driving . 
they sure did . 
they just did an excellent job . 
and they're in the playoffs , 
and i'm not sure that the eagles are not . 
the eagles 
i did . 
  luck into it now , i think . 
that's true . 
cowboys , they earned it on their own merit . 
did you know , everybody , or not everybody but quite a few of the folks were kind of down on mister johnson , 
but , uh , a one and something team to , uh , playoffs , in what , three years now . 
you bet , 
as much as everyone , you know , used the word , love tom landry , i'm glad that jimmy johnson's there . 
well , uh , you know , it was the time for the passing of the guard , i mean . 
it was . 
and i think tom knew it . 
i think so too . 
so , uh , 
he wanted to go out a winner though . 
i think he would have stayed there four or five more years until he could have gone out 
that's true , 
and i wouldn't have blamed him one bit 
oh , no , 
you know 
but , see , nobody remembers him as a loser 
i know . 
oh , yeah . 
he's a winner in anyone's book 
 and i hope he's a winner in his own book , you know because 
oh , he is , 
because he has to like himself 
you bet . 
little things that disturb me , 
and i know he's being a little hardnosed about it 
but , uh , you know , this ring of honor thing , you know , he needs to be there 
he deserves it , 
and he was the dallas cowboys , 
so . i hope he makes up his mind to do it , because 
oh , he will . 
well , nobody's going to forget tom landry . 
absolutely not .
that's true , 
i mean , i'd not a 
let's put it that way . 
you betcha . 
i'm not a native texan by birth 
but , uh , i guess if after you're here twenty years you're considered native . 
you bet . 
i've been here since seventyfour , 
and i feel like a native . 
well , let's see , 
i came down march of sixtynine , went to work for t and i . 
oh , did you . 
so , uh , i haven't looked back yet either , 
we came down from new york state in seventyfour , and uh , never had any regrets at all . 
especially looking at some of the weather new york state has had 
you bet . 
it's been . 
 and then look at the weather we have down here . 
it's a great place to raise our kids , 
and i've got my last kid graduating from college this next december 
she's getting married the month before in november , 
oh , goodness . 
i will be finished 
 and , uh , uh , he's over halfway , 
well , good . 
but i'm really not too concerned , 
are you ? 
me neither . 
i'm enjoying the chat . uh . 
well , i enjoy my t v programs . 
i like those , 
i like those detective programs . 
i like everything . 
i can watch bill cosby because i think he has a great show . 
 do you have , uh , some strong feelings one way or the other about the care of the elderly ? 
well , yes , 
uh , this is a question that hit pretty close to home . 
i had to go through this with my dad about four years ago . 
his health was failing 
 and , uh , he was adamant about two things . 
one was that i take care of my mother , 
and two , that he not be put into a home . 
and we talked , uh , about some length , 
and i respected his wishes . 
he , uh , stayed at home as long as he could , 
and then , uh , he died in a hospital . 
but , um , i think that , my position of the , uh , of their clients 
 and , um , because i've heard about the many abuses , and because he had heard of so many abuses , he just didn't want that . 
how about you ? 
well , my graduate work is in speech pathology , 
and , uh , so , so , uh , i've thought about this more than once , uh , you know , dealing with 
 uh , you know , i'm concerned , we're going to have a geriatric , uh , population , in twenty years it's going to be , you know , phenomenal . 
uh , and , um , but i have been amazed 
and in talking with , uh , some of my fellow students , it looks as though , um , nursing homes are not going to be the only option any more 
and , uh , in twenty years . uh , where a lot of students are hoping , uh , to work as an in the home type , uh , uh , approach , the loved one to stay , you know , at home 
uh , to have them at home , because then the family becomes completely , uh 
they're captive . 
uh , like what you're talking about . 
we had the visiting nurses program 
 and they sent somebody in , 
and uh , it started out that the lady would come in i think three times a week and eventually got up to the point where they were coming by every day . 
they would try to get him to exercise . 
they would try to , uh , you know , 
they would check him over to , you know , the basic checks . 
try to get him to talk and be motivated 
 and , uh , that's what we went through . 
uh , up to a point things seemed to be working , 
and then , uh , i think , he became discouraged 
 and they did not know how to take care of that , 
and then , um , at that point i think it's mostly a psychological problem . 
and , uh , but , yes , 
i agree there's a lot of options . 
there could be a lot of options . 
i think it's time that , uh , we decide to do something about it . 
this would be an excellent example of uh , some place where , um , the community could be more involved , you know , more than just leaving it only to professionals . 
there is a lot or assist the lives of those who are keeping a loved one at home . 
i suppose at one time the church would fulfill this need . 
possibly before . 
i don't know now . 
the church or synagogue , whatever 
but in today's large metropolitan areas , or even the rural areas now , people are not quite as close as they once were . 
uh , the mobility factor , the factor that , uh , oh , we're living longer and people are less trusting , all these things tend to destroy this type of system . 
but i agree with you , 
there might be some possibilities there . 
although dealing with geriatrics is something a lot of young people just aren't emotionally prepared to do . 
i agree . 
that's a good point . 
i think they would have to have some training . 
uh , let's see . 
personal computers . 
so , do you use them ? 
uh , yes , 
what kind ? 
uh , its an emerson eighty eightysix , um , two low density floppy drives , and no hard drive yet . 
but , uh , you know , it comes in mighty handy . 
mostly for word processing type things ? 
uh , yeah , 
we're also taking programming classes , 
and , uh , so there's a fair amount of programming getting done on it . 
but , uh , uh , the , uh , 
right now we got a project going where we're trying to put , uh , all my wife's stray recipes on the disk . 
did you buy a program to handle menus ? 
uh , it came with a menus program , 
but , uh , that doesn't , 
it basi , 
both , excuse me , 
mostly kind of a pain in the neck without a hard drive 
oh , yes . 
 and hopefully sometime this spring we'll be able to get one and get it configured . 
eighty eightysix . 
eighty , 
oh gosh , it's worth your time to just upgrade , 
they're so darned cheap now . 
uh , impoverished college student . 
oh , no . 
this one went on a credit card , 
and we got a way out , while to pay it off yet . 
 uh , i've got one at home too . 
it's a three eightysix , thirtythree megahertz , forty , four meg ram and hundred and thirty meg drive 
and , yeah , it's fun . 
i do programming , too . 
my job is , uh , e d p auditor , 
and so i'm into computers all the time . 
e d p . 
electronic data processing . 
that sounds like fun job . 
i really enjoy it , 
and it treats me well . 
uh , what are you studying in college 
how nice . 
well , computer engineering technology , uh , which , uh , all i can understand is it's a slightly more hands on version of computer engineering . 
but , i've got a ways to go yet . 
so far most of what i've done is getting , core classes out of the way , 
taken some electronics classes , and one class um , with computer logic . 
how they work is fascinating to me . 
oh , yes . 
i enjoy it myself .
the , uh , lab for that , uh , computer logic class was a lot of fun . 
was it . 
hardware stuff , huh . 
what do you think of that fuzzy logic ? 
i've not had a chance to work with it , although , um , my , uh , data structures teacher was telling us something about how fuzzy logic works as far as the concept behind it . 
now how you'd implement that software wise or mechanically i don't know , 
but , uh , it sounds like a very impressive piece of work . 
they're pretty amazing . 
uh , i've written a couple of programs for , commercially , uh 
 and it's a fun field . 
in the fuzzy logic direction ? 
but you have to take into account , you know , with any computer program all the type of things people can do to you to make your program crash or things you 
entering bad information of one sort or another 
pushing keys certain times and ,
and you're going to be an computer engineer type . 
uh , yeah , 
you get a fair amount of programming , 
you get hardware , 
and , uh , just the whole gambit , but mostly towards , uh , computer electronics . 
so , the idea is that , um , you can go in a variety of direction from c e t major , 
but i have more   with the hardware than i do with the software , 
so , yeah 
i don't , 
that's good , uh , 
uh , well , where in dallas are you ? 
i'm in richardson . 
oh , okay . 
so you do recycling there ? 
and they also have a couple of areas where you can take , uh , cans , plastic and paper , to , uh , you know , dump them off there if you don't , uh , want to wait and have a pick up , least of paper , 
but they don't pick up the other items . 
they don't pick up cans or the 
are they going to later , 
do you know ? 
i'm not sure . 
they only started to do the newspaper  , uh , late last year . 
just kind of like a trial basis .
what about you ? 
and i know they do have , you know , a pilot program going on 
but it's not here . 
so they're not picking up anything .
so , i mean , we collect everything .
we've got all these boxes in our garage for , you know , green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything . 
where do you take them ? 
well , there's a couple places . 
unfortunately , we can't find a place that will take everything . 
uh , there's a lot of places to take , like the plastic , uh , shopping bags 
and there's a walmart nearby that takes almost everything . 
i can't remember what it is they don't take . 
and the library will take glass . 
so we end up , you know , 
on the weekend we pack it all in the car 
drop things off one at a time , 
but , uh , and it's kind of disappointing , i mean , 
i would even be happy if they just had you know , one place where you could do everything . 
you know , it would still be more convenient than what we have now . 
one of the people from my department , i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the dallas shelter . 
i think it was 
where is that ? 
uh , she's not here anymore 
 but , uh , yeah , 
i'm pretty far north . 
i'm north of addison actually . 
so i'm really 
 i'm in dallas , but only technically .
well , sometimes uh , we always keep our aluminum cans . 
and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks . 
i've seen those . 
you don't get too much money back . 
i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there . 
but normally i collect , oh , like three trash bags full 
 and i take them over to that can bank 
and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans  ,
don't get too much money for them 
well , you get something .
we used to do that , 
but , again , that's another stop 
 and it doesn't take plastic bags and all that sort of thing , 
but , uh , you know , i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is 
that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week 
 and , where i grew up we only had one a week 
and that was certainly sufficient . 
so if they just do , 
one of them will be trash 
and the alternate time would be recyclables , 
that would be great . 
uh , i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers , you know . 
i seem to put them out there 
and like sometimes they come by , 
sometimes they don't . 
i'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that . 
but i could certainly have , uh , three bins out there for , you know , plastic 
that would be easy . 
do you have to , uh , sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that sort of thing 
or do they take the whole thing ? 
you're not supposed to have , like the coupons in there . 
oh , okay . 
uh , or you're not supposed to put magazines in there 
 and you can't take newspapers . 
now at work , uh , you know , we have changed our recycling . 
at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle . 
and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears , you can throw it in there because at first 
you work at t i , 
so do i . 
you know , well , that's stupid 
well , in my department everybody gets the wall street journal . 
there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable . 
so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it , 
well , and they take cans , now , too .
i still put my cans in with the cans . 
i mean , i don't want it with paper . 
somehow that just seems weird to me .
 well , our department used to collect the cans anyway for the christmas tree project . 
and it worked out really well . 
well , we had the one person who used to take things to the dallas shelter . 
i think that's what that was called . 
she used to collect from the whole department , 
but she took them all down to that dallas shelter place . 
i wish i could remember the whole name of that place , 
but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter . 
and , yeah , 
she used to collect them from everybody in the department . 
she'd go up and down with her little bag 
because we would get it , 
you got any hobbies that you want to talk about ? 
well , i , uh , don't seem to have as much spare time as i used to , 
but , i guess i'll have to say my computer has probably taken the place of most of my hobbies . 
what in the world do you do with your computer that takes so much time ? 
well , i sit and design cards 
oh , really ? 
 and , uh , oh , i'm really into graphics , 
so , i sit and learn new programs 
and i play  , 
and i do this , 
and i do that 
did you have , uh , your own business 
or you do that just on the side , or what ? 
 and , uh , it's just getting going . 
i'm teaching in the daytime 
 and , uh , 
what do you teach ? 
oh , that's good . 
well , i guess .
uh , to high school kids , it's , uh , alternative learning 
 and , uh , it's really a challenge , 
but . what hobbies do you have ? 
well , i , uh , play trombone in the plano community band . 
ooh , neat . 
and i , uh , like to do a lot of bicycling when the weather allows , and during summer when there's daylight savings time's when i get out and bike . 
well , i hope you all had as pretty a day today as we did . 
well , it wasn't too bad , other than the cowboys didn't do so hot . 
oh , well now , yes .
i don't think you can blame the weather on that . 
we had . 
just a crummy , well , actually 
the lions are pretty good , i'm afraid , a lot better team than the cowboys were today . 
and , uh ,   .
uh , i haven't played in a while , but i do , when i get time and it's pretty weather and it's summer i like to play golf . 
oh , okay . 
i play that about six times a year 
and every year i hang my bag up if i get that five or six 
and i swear that game off for another year , 
but i always go back to it .
oh , uh , oh , i take spells , 
i'm kind of a compulsive obsessive person 
and when i start something , i go into it a thousand percent 
i understand that . 
 and then i get burned out on it . 
but , uh , i do some counted crossstitch and some painting on shirts . 
well , you do lots of stuff . 
well , it doesn't seem like i get anything done , 
but i guess i do 
it's just me in the house , 
so , when i bake it's usually to take out for something . 
i come up there i'll have to stop by and try some of your baking . 
i call on people in   .
my business is , uh , machine tool sales , 
and i have some , 
i cover texas and oklahoma . 
oh , okay . 
so , what i said that i wasn't being real facetious about that . 
i got customers in oklahoma city and tulsa and perry , oklahoma 
 oh , how neat . 
so you do quite a bit of traveling then . 
about thirtythree thousand miles a year . 
ooh , well that doesn't leave a lot of time for hobbies , 
does it ? 
 well , i usually , 
see , our band practice is on monday night , 
and during the summer uh , we have concerts every monday night in the park , 
and , uh , we have , you know , some concerts during the year , 
and , you know , various people in the communities want us to play for things , 
but those are usually on the weekend , 
so that isn't too bad . 
how big is your band ? 
well , we got , uh , pretty good size band . 
not everybody shows up , 
but if everyone did we'd probably have over a hundred 
well , that's still a pretty good size band . 
it's not like there are four or five of you there . 
oh , no , 
this is a , 
it's a concert band , 
and , uh , we have a lot of , 
i don't pretend to be that good , 
but there's a lot of people that , uh , you know , are band directors at schools , or have been , 
or , uh , you know , there some people that are actually music majors . 
they don't necessarily follow that any more , you know , 
that isn't necessarily their career , 
but , uh , we have some extremely good talent in there , 
and , uh , as a rule , it sounds pretty decent , 
it's fun . 
i have absolutely no musical ability whatsoever , 
and i'm always very envious of people who do . 
 well , i don't know if i have any or not . 
i've always enjoyed it . 
i sing in a church choir on wednesday nights when i'm around , and play in the band on monday nights , and keeps you out of trouble that way . 
well , i'm probably one of the few people that the , 
well , i think it's inevitable that we are going to see national health care 
and the reason is because the market place doesn't seem to have performed adequately , uh , the invisible hand that which adam smith wrote has , uh , provided some very good health care and , uh , much , i think inadequate health care . uh , 
and in some cases , the absence of health care has resulted from market place forces 
it is just a matter of , uh , time and mistakes 
and they're both inevitable . 
well what is this going to do the insurance companies who are supporting this work now and hopefully are doing , uh , a good job ? 
well , it's going to make it tough for them 
and it's going to be a difficult transition . 
i don't know , uh , how it's going to , uh , play out in terms of the particulars , 
but i don't think that society will be willing to tolerate the current health care crisis for too long . 
our , uh , physical and mental and spiritual health , uh , it's really , uh , very costly . 
and , uh , as a society we are paying a staggering price for this . 
do you think that there should be some control , uh , innovated such that the doctors are not allowed to charge ridiculously over priced things . 
we realize that for the individual person , some things are very important . 
uh , matter of fact , in some respects their life might depend on it . 
but , by the same token some of these charges they make for well , minor endeavors , shall we say 
there should be some control of that . 
and that is what is giving the local , uh , insurance companies hard times . 
that is the one thing we have no control over are these charges that happen when you go to hospitals 
and you get something done 
and they want to charge twenty thousand dollars for it . 
well , this i think is one of the things that national health care of some sort of evolutionary process over the next ten , or twenty or thirty years will address . 
because i know this is , addressed uh , in canada . 
i have a good friend who is , uh , a physician practicing in canada . 
and they made the transition , uh , 
and i think that the , uh , 
for example the duplication of magnetic resonance imageries 
we have had several of them . 
my wife and i both have had that recently . 
i've had one myself 
and , uh , they're wonderful technology , 
but cities have three or four more than they need or three or four times the number they need . 
so , i think that what the market place doesn't do because of the way the system has worked 
and it doesn't allocate resources oftenly because uh , at least there has been a tendency to drive up the price of medical care primarily because the insurance companies could pass on the bills , 
but it's begun to change all of that . 
the people paying the bills , uh , 
employers ultimately , have begun to squawk because they have seen their health care cost rise two hundred percent in the past ten years . 
so , i think the evolution will be interesting . 
uh , hawaii has a system that is apparently working 
and , uh , it will be interesting to see how , uh , much more attention we pay to that . 
i do think though that it is inevitable primarily because of the pain , uh , that people are feeling , uh , under the circumstances . 
uh , i believe that it will contribute to something that we would at this point call national health care , whether it's subsidized by the government and operated by private insurers , uh , 
i don't know . 
i like that idea . 
i tend to be one of those people who believes the market place can under varied circumstances with the profit incentive work very very well . 
uh , if we , contracted our national defense to a group who rather that operated as a government entity because we would probably have much less waste . 
see , that bothers me about the government see , 
uh , my , 
 well that's the problem with government , uh , administration of these programs 
and that is one of the things that we as society are going to have to deal with . 
government is going to have to change in this regard . 
you know , that is really a tough one for me to answer . 
uh , i would like to see the greatest improvement in management . 
my field is the cognitive sciences 
and i recognize that a lot of these things that are done , are done , uh , as a function of the operating systems in place . 
and those operating systems have to change 
and as we become more efficient in developing machine operating systems we're going to develop more efficient human operating systems 
and so a state or federal application , uh , could work . 
uh , it all depends upon the way you structure the environment . 
we may have to deal with , 
i'm ready . 
well in atlanta , georgia you probably have a lot more crime than we have here in patterson , california . 
 uh , this little city is only about eight thousand people . 
is crime a problem there ? 
  like a major problem , minor problem or , 
well in patterson there's , 
it's not a problem here . 
but like , uh , i lived in oakland , uh , until just recently 
 and , uh , oakland , california , god , they've had like , uh , sixtyseven murders so far this year compared to like , uh , forty at this time last year . 
so it's really bad there . 
and it's all related to drugs it seems like . 
 oh , yeah . 
is that what it's there too ? 
probably just over six months i 
 uh , i came from a smaller town in new york 
 and the city was fairly big size or not real big 
but we had a problem there 
but here there's just no comparison that , much more crime . 
uh , every night the news is very depressing because they run down the list of how many people were shot , you know , drive by shootings or 
and it's pretty bad . 
things have basically improved here over the last few years . 
they've actually taken steps to try to make it better 
but it still is a problem . 
like i don't know what they can do to make it better unless they just hire more policemen . 
well that seems to be what they were doing 
stepped up more patrols in certain areas 
and it 
but , you know , it's very difficult . 
i mean if you don't have an infinite amount of money to try to stop the problem although most people wish you could 
 well i think that if they would do something to these people that they do catch instead of just slapping their little hands 
 and , you know , then maybe those other people would be kind of scared 
and they would not do these bad things , you know . 
they do something , you know , 
they shoot somebody or whatever , 
they go to jail , 
sentenced to jail for like thirty years they're out in five 
and they're back on the street 
and then they shoot someone else 
and just a cycle 
and it tend to stop them unless something is drastic is done . 
i just don't understand our laws here . 
because , you know , like in other countries , man , i mean , they're really a lot stricter than we are . 
it's , definitely true . 
and maybe some of the people don't deserve the humanitarian treatment that they get . 
but i don't know . 
it's a difficult situation i think 
and reeks havoc with your quality of life when , you know , you can see it's going on around you 
but then when , once it finally affects you then it really starts to bother you . 
but it seems , i mean , 
people have moved like out of the city because they want to get away from the crime 
and so they tend to spread the cities farther and farther out 
but , you know , it's only a matter of time before , you know , it still catches up with them . 
you can't really run away from the problem 
 and you know , something has to be done but just that too many people argue about how to fix it . 
i know when i lived in oakland , it was just that , uh , like , i definitely wouldn't go into certain areas of the city by myself . 
oh , sure . 
then again some areas i wouldn't go by myself after dark 
but down here , in patterson , well like i say , it's so small 
that's good  .
 but just , uh , like twenty miles away see in modesto , they have , uh , those gangs and things over there . 
and it's bad . 
in sacramento also , they have , uh , drive by shootings it seems like all the time . 
so , i don't know . 
what they can do you know . 
from their car to the mall or something 
and it's dangerous . 
i know . 
and that's just ridiculous 
and you know , that's just not right . 
something  you know  .
 i mean like even going to the grocery store . 
i know we've had this one lady that was attacked , you know . 
i mean , you just don't know what to do anymore , you know . 
and some of the times it's happening in the daytime too , you know , 
so it's not always happening at dark . 
so i don't know . 
it's definitely unfortunate .
uh , let me see .
i've been sitting here awhile . 
but , uh , it seems like i get most of my news from television . 
we only get the paper on the weekends 
and so i'm not much of a paper reader 
 and i'm don't , rarely listen to the , uh , radio 
so i get most of my news like from documentaries like fortyeight hours , twenty twenty , you know , the news at night .
well i get a ,
and , uh , in addition to that i get a local weekly . 
i live in suburb of milwaukee 
 and their extremely local stuff 
and then i get the sunday , uh , milwaukee journal because i don't have time to read a paper . 
uh , mostly 
and that's national public radio which 
are you in the car quite a bit 
but i can run my radio in my office . 
and when i'm not 
oh , i see . uh , 
are you satisfied with the twenty twenty and fortyeight hours and the things that you do watch ? 
and i watch the news at least twice a day . 
so , uh , if i've missed something and i've just recently decided to stay home with my children 
and so it seems as if i catch the news right as it happens , you know . 
there was the explosions and that kind of thing . 
it happened at such and such time .
and that's different for me . 
so i usually find out exactly when it happens and that kind of thing . 
is that the aspect of the news that you're most interested in noting of the events as they happen ? 
is that what you feel good about in the news coverage ? 
 uh , no 
it's just that , uh , now that i've stayed home , i'm usually aware of when these things occurred 
 and it happened 
well , i , myself , uh , the reason why i listen to n p r and the reason why i watch macneil lehrer ,
the local doesn't either 
but i feel that macneil lehrer get a little more deeply into some of the issues that are really current . 
and perhaps newspapers do that 
but as i said , i don't have time to sit down and read a newspaper 
and frankly when i have read a newspaper 
so . uh , there is some danger to that , of course , too . 
because if the analysis is inaccurate or biased or whatever then , you know , how good is it . 
but , uh , i like a little more indepth coverage 
and i think that's what maybe appealing to you too on something like twenty twenty or 
 it kind of gives you the whole story or more of the story . 
that kind of thing . 
so . uh , 
i'm more interested in trying to understand what's going on in the world 
i like to stand back and get a slightly bigger picture . 
maybe because i'm easily confused by detail . 
i don't know .
i know what you're saying . 
but i try and catch most of those programs on wednesday's and friday's 
and if i miss them , and tape them if i'm out   that kind of thing , 
and so i can sit back and watch them . 
and it's pretty interesting . 
so those evening shows are probably also at a time when you're at liberty to take some time off and be in front of the t v set for awhile without interruption . 
 well , yeah . 
oh , you do ? 
if i don't want any interruptions , you know . 
that kind of thing . 
when is your good watching time ? 
uh , it seems like ten o'clock at night .
that's what , 
i have older children 
i come from the east coast 
and i was , 
it amazed me when i got out here to the midwest and found out that even though they're an hour earlier in time , they still watch the news when , 
 uh , in texas they do have the , uh , capital punishment 
and , uh , i'm probably one that has to agree with it too . 
uh , there a , 
some things that go on that that is a need . 
i don't know . 
a lot of people don't feel that way either 
but i just feel that  , 
 well i don't know how much publicity it's gotten outside of the state 
but california we just put somebody to death 
uh , to be honest , i didn't pay that much attention , uh , to the details of it . uh , 
but it had a lot of controversy out here . 
uh , basically , because in california people like to protest about everything . 
uh , but i agree , 
i believe that there are a number of crimes that capital punishment is the best way to go . 
uh , the big disagreement i have is that in california , the appeals process , uh , is so extensive and takes so long that you end up spending a huge amount of money in like ten to fifteen years before you can actually , you know , put somebody to death for , for a crime . 
that is a consequence , 
and , i mean , that's ridiculous . 
i mean if you can , you know , the trial is supposed to prove , you know , within a reasonable doubt that the person is guilty , 
and then they have appeals . 
well , that's fine 
but it shouldn't take more ,
i mean , i should think 
and you should be able to either put the guy to death 
or he's innocent . 
 i mean 
well maybe that's something that needs to be worked on . 
but that capital punishment needs to stay within the system . 
not all states have them 
but i , you know , i'm not sure if that was in , 
was that the man that claimed he was abused 
 and that he had 
  he   , 
 oh , yeah . 
and so he wasn't , you know , mentally competent or anything else .
and the court found him competent , uh , 
and he knew what he was doing and everything else . 
i mean 
and how long had he been appealing  ? 
how long was that ? 
i forget . 
i think it was something like twelve years or something . 
it was something really outrageous . 
boy . well , i mean 
and it seems like it rarely does happen . 
you know , it's not used that often 
but i think it's something that needs to stay . 
i really do .
i think in general , uh , punishment in the united states is a lot weaker than it should be . 
i mean , it needs to be , you know , 
it's kind of like the , the justice system in the united states is kind of like the dog poops on the carpet 
and you wait three months 
and then you put his nose in it and spank him for it .
i mean there's no connection between the two . 
i mean you take you know , most of the people who are committing violent crimes , most of them , not all by any means , 
but , you know , a large percentage are the kind of people who are living very much day to day in the first place . 
uh , they don't really see past next week much less next year . 
that's not real . 
it doesn't have any real impact on them . 
my sister and i were wondering about this recently because an old friend of ours in california ,
uh , her husband just killed her 
and we're wondering if that has an effect . 
within that , uh , 
i don't know .
uh , you mean , would he be put to death for that ? 
uh , largely depends on the circumstances 
and generally , you know , from what i understand , it's only the most brutal types of things usually . 
where it's multiple , you know . 
i think you're right . 
if they can say things like , you know , well he was just , you know , temporarily insane because of ,
and , uh , i have an uncle that is an attorney that defends people  , 
um , does your work entitle , uh , anything of environmental along these lines ? 
i'm in the legal department 
and , um , we do have , uh , a group of attorneys who handle our environmental issues . 
and i don't know too much about the air pollution thing . 
i do know for other types of pollution like the toxic waste and such that t i has to dispose of that we normally put in the ground , you know , we're coming up with uh , a new solution . 
we have been finding a lot of toxic places to dump 
and we just transport to these places . 
but after awhile it always seems that um , oh , the site starts to leak 
and then you have to clean it up and such . 
but the new idea is to take everything up to sherman , 
and we're going have that , you know , incineration place up there and ,
and supposedly that facility will not generate air pollutants from what i've heard , that everything would be confined kind of incinerator and just burn it all up . 
and that we won't be polluting the air . 
i'm sure we have to have , uh , permits , you know , for that place . and that there's , you know , limits as to what we can , uh , let , you know , go into the air . 
it's , uh , hav , uh , uh , well , 
i work in environmentals , uh , projects right now . 
oh , okay . 
and so the sherman deal um , uh , lost a lot of hair over that project . 
uh , what we run into , um , is we have the texas air control board , t a c b , that send out , uh , jurisdictions under which we have to , uh , uh , reply to . 
and a lot of their rules and regulation aren't real clear , so we have our manager of environmental , who assist the t a c b , which is located in austin , in writing 
look what we've done here at t i . 
and , uh , we are presently , uh , in receipt of a site permit , which will allow us to , um , uh , 
this is our side a , 
it's in , 
and so , and ammonia compounds , uh , like all the acids , to a certain level . 
so if you don't see anything coming out of a stack the opacity is zero or twenty or thereabouts . 
and so what we go through is , uh , if you see it smoking there's a problem . 
and having worked with some of the legal folks very closely , uh , it becomes a real issue , especially , when it's smoking 
and you have to get it fixed el pronto . 
as you know , they're allowed to come on site , the federaldes , anytime they want , drive through , and see , and inspect . 
so it's a full time , uh , everybody has their home phone number type of job . um , 
now is that place built 
or you're still on the makings of it ? 
the sherman facility , we are still in the , closer too , but still have a little bit of , um , finalization to do . 
it's been pitched to the sherman city council with , um , 
we had open forum 
corporate environmental guys handle the project . 
and , uh , its uh , going real well . 
i think it's just a matter of fund , 
but uh , it's something else . 
they're in the same issue . 
we were hoping on burning a lot of the effluent up there . 
uh , because the system is setup where it won't have any emissions . 
you're correct . 
it will have something coming out of the stackhouse it was , 
but it won't have uh , any bad stuff . 
so , uh , i think t i , of all the major semiconductor firms , we probably put safety and environmental on the utmost , foremost , uh , uh , first thing we always look at . 
and we probably put more money into the systems and engineering behind the system of any other firm i know of . 
we eat and sleep the stuff , everything we do over here . 
and , uh , it's an interesting job . 
but um , 
well , i know from some of the sites that we've had , uh , quite a list of cites that have gone bad 
and you have to clean up . 
and , you know the law now is the super fund 
and anybody who's contributed toxic waste , no matter if you were somebody that eventually , you know , uh , damaged the ground or not . 
uh , everybody has to contribute 
and it's been a lot of big bucks when we've uh , gotten pulled into these super fund deals to clean it up and , you know , mega bucks to , uh , you know take everything out and redo it and , you know , fill in some other area 
and , um , certainly , it would to have a better solution , like the sherman facility than , um , just letting it go in the ground . 
because eventually , you know , it seems that no matter what they do , if they put it in oil drums and then seal it in some kind of cement lined , uh , dump area . 
it still only in time starts to leak out . 
there was one site that they cleaned up 
and then the new place leaked again .   .
i'm familiar with that one . 
we have stuff that's very interesting , uh , 
we have hoods , 
we have duckwork and all those type of interesting pieces of equipment where , um , they have , um , that we sample 
 and it may have over , uh , a certain emission levels , 
this is on the  solid side   , 
and so we take it 
and , uh , we can't  deep well  inject something like that because it's a solid . 
and we mix it with concrete 
it was totally legal . 
but the cost of doing this is astronomical ,
and so we were , uh , very , very , uh , cognizance of , and aware of all these types of , uh , expenditures because it could get very expensive . 
but i think the world a better place to live , you know , 
i think some of the folks that aren't aware of it will be surprised at how much effort and energy is put into doing that . 
i really would . 
um , i've enjoyed speaking with you , 
uh , i was one of the , 
i was responsible for all the planning and engineering over the corporate , or in the north building .
oh , you were ? 
oh , okay . 
it's a heck of a lot different . 
and we used to be really embarrassed about the gray metal desk . 
we were about the only ,
well , y'all were the only ones that make any money for ti , here in the last ten years ,
nobody thought of us as a profit center before . 
and that's , um , when you start paying your way , uh , you know , jerry takes a different outlook towards you guys . 
i was just , 
not just overhead . 
i've enjoyed speaking with you . 
you too . 
see you later . 
in order to make the , uh , curried chicken , i just fried the chicken ,
make sure it's nice and brown on both sides 
and then you take it out of the fat 
and you let the chicken you fried kind of drain , so that a lot of the oil comes out of it .
and then all of the oil out of the pan 
and you kind of clean it out 
and you put back maybe two tablespoons full of the oil and saute some , um , bell peppers and onions in that little bit of oil . 
maybe one tablespoon or two tablespoons , let that brown , then put all of the chicken back in there . 
and then you , uh , mix flour and a cup of water , maybe , uh , one tablespoon of flour and a cup of water . 
stir it real , real well . 
then you , uh , pour that in there , you know , to make the gravy . 
and you let it come to a boil again 
and then you let it simmer 
and you add , uh , about a tablespoon of , what i'm using now is jamaican curry powder . 
and it's going to be really good .
that's very spicy , too . 
i mean these bell peppers and curry . 
and then if you like it really hot , you can add some hot , hot peppers and hot sauce and all that kind of stuff . 
oh , that sounds really good . 
i guess it was , 
is this dinner time for you ? 
i'm trying to get it ready early . 
all done in advance , 
i'm not that great a cook 
but i was single until i was thirty 
so i did cook a little , you know . 
uh , and i cook a little bit now . 
what i like to do mostly is stir fries 
and so we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok . 
and we do a lot of , um , stir fry vegetables . 
what kind of wok do you have , 
is it a real chinese wok . 
it's called a stir fry pan 
it fits right on your burner , whether it's gas or electric 
so it has a flatter bottom than a normal wok does . 
i see . 
and , um , normally vegetable oil . 
but i will use peanut oil , or things . 
and then we just stir fry broccoli and carrots and , um , green peppers , and , um , maybe put in a little bit of , um garlic and ginger , uh , beforehand . 
that gives , uh , uh , uh , spicier flavor 
and then after the stir fry is over , just mix in , um , a little bit of , uh , sometimes chicken broth ,
and that sort of makes uh , a glaze ,
i've used , 
you turn them over . 
a lot of times when we do stir fry we just put in tofu , 
we don't put in meat ,
but , uh , she likes to watch how much red meat and things , 
so . we'll do , a lot of times vegetarian . 
but it's a real good meal because you have squash and broccoli and , uh , carrots and celery and green peppers and , um , oh , gee , mushrooms . 
oh that's , 
it's a pretty big 
and we put that over rice . 
i just don't like squash . 
oh , you don't .
i never did . 
my mother used to cook a whole pan full of squash 
and she'd have squash and corn bread .
and maybe she'd have chicken or something . 
and i'd just be , 
see , in fact i never had squash growing up . 
ate more vegetable than i did growing up .
i'm from pittsburgh 
and pittsburgh is a very meat and potato town . 
recipes in pittsburgh consisted of red meat and a potato . 
oh , that sounds good . 
we were from north carolina 
and we had a garden 
and my mother would , uh , grow the squash 
and she'd grow white potatoes and onions and cabbage and collards and all kinds of , 
oh , she had all of those types of vegetables . 
see , no vegetables in my family . 
it was really funny . 
you wouldn't believe it , we even raised chickens .
 well that was a real farm . 
you ever seen anybody kill a chicken ? 
and they put the head under a tin tub and chop the head off . 
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub 
and finally it dies down , 
you get just a little patter 
and then it , 
oh , this is ter , 
you shouldn't be talking about this while you're fixing dinner . 
 getting ready to eat chicken too . 
that's right , 
you should be careful .
that's pretty funny . 
but my dad used to tell stories , you know , about the way they eat chickens 
but we lived in the suburbs , 
we bought everything in a grocery store . 
there was no , 
but it was funny , you know , 
it so , 
but when we got married , you know , a lot more vegetables , you know , a lot of changes . 
well that's good . 
a lot of people are eating healthier now a days . 
i think so too , 
but we just went shopping 
and we came back uh , with , uh , sweets , you know , chocolate covered peanuts 
we didn't bring all the healthy food back too . 
i'm trying to learn how to cook , um , deserts without all of the sweets , you know , maybe use honey or something . 
well that's supposed to be , um , the trend of the future ,
 uh , recently was over a friends house that's indian 
and , uh , she had brought indian sweets into the office 
and it was really funny because they were made from yogurt and carrots . 
that was a sweet 
this is a sweet . 
oh it's a candy , 
indian candy is not very good . 
uh , right . 
and everything , 
you didn't notice it at first , 
but everything was sort of hot . 
everything had a little bit of curry in it . 
the spice , 
it was funny , even the sweets did . 
when you first took a bite of them you didn't notice it 
but then after a couple of minutes you could taste it . 
you know , it had it was a very indian flavor . 
they didn't have , 
i didn't like her desserts very well , 
they were very , yogurt and carrots and pistachio nuts and yogurt . 
and it wasn't very good . 
well i might have liked some of that 
i like hot stuff , 
i really do . 
i think we're , 
i don't know , 
oh , okay 
well that's , 
oh wow . 
so i just thought , 
in fact i'm just also , 
i'm hearing a siren outside i think my neighbors car must have got bumped , you know , 
he has one of those alarms on his car , 
the neighbor has an alarm on a car 
and it's going off . 
so , i was going to go out and see what they were doing . 
well , okay . 
hey thanks so much . 
thank you , 
it was nice talking with you . 
and you said this was your fi , 
and they were arguing back and forth 
it was pretty funny . 
kind of hard that way . 
hey thanks a lot , 
i'll talk to you later . 
all right , 
thank you , 
so , uh , do you own a p c ? 
um , no , 
but you have one at work . 
and , now because , um , 
see i'm doing my , uh , master's in computer science and computer engineering . 
i don't have one , 
but i have to use them ,
you use , um , 
like your first couple of years you use personal computers because , uh , you know , the software . 
you know , like it's easier for you to go to and run a program ,
then , are so big , 
and you have to have so many people sharing the same data ,
i know uh , you know , a computer at home , 
but it's one that the company has loaned me . 
oh , okay . 
and , that's been my situation , is that , uh , that way i can get in , access our , uh , computers that i have up here and , you know , do work from home . 
but does it have , uh , like , a disk drive ? 
oh yeah . 
oh , okay , 
because , uh , the ones that we use , you know , are like unix base systems . 
and , so they don't have a disk drive . 
you know , so you can't , 
the only way that you can do it is through a modem . 
and , you know , you just do it that way . 
but , through to the system , 
you can't store it anywhere . 
that's what i use all the time is unix systems . um , versus the dos . 
but then i teach dos classes , uh , at night . 
oh , okay . 
part time . 
and then you also have to do all your grading on the p c . 
well , any grades , no grade books , so that's great .
oh , okay . 
i find that i use the personal computer a lot though for my wordperfect ,
um , so i think it's extremely helpful and very useful . 
well , uh , for us uh , uh , you know , it's like for doing like , you know , like resumes ,
um , um . uhhuh . 
we use like for example , a mackintosh , which is a lot easier for graphics ,
the p s two yet . 
um , um . uhhuh . 
but i don't know if the software is as easily , you know , like you can manage it a lot easier than the old one . 
the old one you had to go pick a line , use little arrows to go onto the screen and check where you wanted to start , and where ,
that's true . 
and , uh , you also get , you know , 
when you see it on the mackintosh with , you know , the one i have , 
that doesn't have any color , 
you can look at it 
and that's the way it's going to print out . 
and , especially if you have a laser printer , it's going to print out the same way as it's on the screen . 
oh , uhhuh . 
and , so , you know , with the i b m what would happen is , uh , since the software that i had was , it was basically , you know , you only see part of the page . 
and , so , the whole page you never can actually see it , 
you just draw it 
and they have to zoom out and zoom in 
and , you know , it's like , every time that you have to do something it's really a pain . 
what a hassle , 
and , also , you know , it's like for presentations , 
it's like if you have to do any statistical data it can be easily represented on a p c . 
you know , like years back when you didn't have that you would have to map out all these numbers . 
and get a graph which you weren't sure if it was okay or not , you know . 
but , with a new system i can calculate everything so fast ,
you can see what the trend is over the years . 
and , i love all the windows that they have out now too , 
they have really simplified things . 
i had a program due 
and uh , one window i had the program 
and the other one i had the program running .
you know , go back and forth 
and , you know , you always , you know , 
the old ones you had to go out of your program , um , uh , well load up the program again ,
after you load it up change it , hope that's right ,
but with windows you can have the program 
and say it messed up in line fiftyfour . 
so , you take a look at line fiftyfour , 
you take a look at the output at the same time , 
and you can see where it messed up , because , you know it's like in the old computers , the ones that , uh , we're using here a couple of years ago , you would always have to have a printout ,
i know , uh , i remember my college days . nd having to do that too . 
did you learn it in computer science ? 
oh , yeah , 
and , when was this . 
uh , i graduated in eightysix . 
oh , okay . 
so it's been fairly recent . 
i know because , uh , all i know is that when i came here in eightyseven , uh , 
the cards . 
oh , oh dear . 
i didn't have to bother with that at all , thank goodness . 
so , yeah . 
but it was just sensational because i walked in 
it was like , this is the last year you can put your punch cards in and get your program out 
and , you know  ,
and that's about it . 
so . but , i mean , the price of computers has gone down . 
they said that , um , if the auto industry would have kept the same trend as the computer industry has ever since , you know , it started ,
and they would run forever . 
oh , that would be great . 
so , i mean it's like , you know , the joke with the yugo , you know , 
and , that's the way it would be . 
but i mean the price has really gone down . 
i mean , i b m which , uh , 
an i b m p c in like in nineteen eightyone it would cost you five thousand dollars , 
oh , sure , 
and now you can get it , you know , like for , one thousand dollars , you know , because of the parts basically . 
and the two eightysix too , 
so , yeah . 
the parts and the labor is what they're charging you , 
and , i think they stopped producing the i b m p c . 
uh , and the , uh , p c junior was a total failure ,
they had , uh , 
they're trying to get out small computers , 
but , the only problem was that when they took that one out , the small computer was the i b m p c .
and , so , you couldn't , you know , 
and , so . 
but , over the past years it's like i b m has been producing like 
every two years they bring out a whole new system .
and so . it's just that you have to always compete 
and , uh , mackintosh took a lot of the market from a lot of schools . 
because of their , you know , 
you can work with it a lot easier . 
that's true . 
so , that's what they're trying to do . 
oh , well , 
all right , 
bye , bye . 
now , we used to be big time campers 
but now we're not quite so much since the kids are involved so much in sports . 
what type of camping did you do ? 
well before we had kids , we was in a motorcycle group ,
we went like twenty or thirty at a time . 
we took , uh , just our little tents , 
and we did it that way . 
then when we started having children we bought a camper .
oh , uhhuh . 
and we did it that way . 
oh , how neat . 
so , we've always enjoyed camping . 
well , i know um , i just have a tent , 
and the kids and i like to go out and camp in the tent . 
and then i bought a van 
and that way i can sleep in the van and be more comfortable .
now we have friends with a van , 
and when they go on vacation a lot of times they'll just sleep in the van , you know . 
like one night 
and the next night they'll stay at the motel , you know , or something like that . 
and they enjoy it . 
i don't think i'm a real true , trooper , you know , when it comes ,
all the bugs and stuff .
but i try .
i hate to be on  all that stuff  .
but i try ,
oh , yeah . 
but what was so fun though is that i had to take my son to the doctor this morning because he went out camping with some friends 
and he got poison ivy , 
and it's all over him . 
so , there's definitely hazards to going camping if you don't know what you're looking at .
but now , i enjoy it every once in a while , 
i mean , it's not something i'd want to do real often . 
i'm a sissy . 
i either want to do it in the fall or spring . 
you know ? 
definitely when it's cool . 
well , have you done much camping around texas ? 
it's usually like that . 
well , have you camped all over the united states ? 
see now i haven't so that , 
i bet you that's an experience there . 
oh , it really is . 
also i said we mostly did ours before we started a family . 
it's a lot easier then . 
well , i know my parents like to camp a lot , 
and uh , they've been going to gulf shores , alabama .
oh , uhhuh . 
they said they've got the white beaches and the sand , 
and it's not real populated so they feel like they're in the outdoors and still close to the ocean . 
and , uh , from what i understand from them it's really , really pretty there . 
i'd like to go anywhere . 
you know , i just like to go . 
i really do . 
well , have you done much camping up in kentucky and those parts ,
not that much . 
um , well , we've been to wyoming , you know , and kentucky and montana and , you know , places like that . 
but usually if we're with a group of people  we  really don't stay any one place very long . 
you know , like if we're just going through and they camp one night and then head on . 
but now that we have children and we go every blue moon ,
oh , yeah , 
but uh , we're getting more into it 
and uh , we've done quite a bit 
and , uh , uh , the kids like to go out , you know , as often as they can .
um , so that's good . 
you know , they're becoming enthusiasts then of camping . 
it is . 
my children really enjoys it . 
they really do . 
but by the time we really get a chance to it's july , you know , 
and it's so hot . 
and our camper doesn't have an air conditioner . 
oh , yeah . 
it's one of those popups . 
i'm sure you could put one in probably , 
but we hadn't did that . 
well , that's really neat . 
we all enjoy camping . 
and scouts and stuff like that , you know , 
at least their daddy goes with them , 
i don't ,
oh , that's neat . 
that's really neat . 
well , how old is your boys , 
well , i , 
so , they're getting old enough to where they can help out with a campfire and ,
oh , yes . 
so , that's really neat . 
it really is . 
mine's eleven and eight . 
so , they really enjoy it too . 
i agree with you . 
they like to get out there 
and , but this wasn't so fun this last time for nathan to get out there 
and he didn't realize he was touching poison ivy 
and it got all into his eye 
and it was really swollen 
and , uh , so they had to give him shots and everything , 
but i have , uh , brotherinlaw and a sister , you know , that really just camp . 
you know , they love to go camping . 
they would all the time they wanted , you know , 
but i'm just not that involved in it . 
now i like to go out like several times a year . 
but not on the regular basis . 
i have some friends who go out every single weekend ,
uh , and i just couldn't do that ,
i don't know what you would do every  ,
but i guess , my entertainment's ,
just getting away . 
i see , they just want to get away . 
but every friday night they'll go home , you know , straight from work 
and they'll pack up 
you know , and then they'll leave , 
and i'm just going , you know , 
by friday night i just want to crash , you know , 
and i want to go home and , you know , do all that ,
oh , i don't either .
but anyway that's their life .
but they probably live in a city also , 
don't they ? 
well , see , we're in a real small county area , 
and , you know , that makes a big difference . 
now that's true . 
because if we want to go camping we can just go just a few miles , you know .
that's true . 
that makes a difference . 
well , it was nice talking with you . 
it was nice talking to you too , 
and we'll probably be talking to you again . 
well , take care . 
so , do you have any credit cards ? 
uh , i have an american express , and a visa card that i keep , you know , kind of for emergency purposes , 
and you know , i use a gasoline credit card which i , you know , pay off 
but i've gotten rid of all of the credit cards , you know , that i possibly could , 
and my balances are practically zero on the ones that i have . 
especially since , you know , it's no longer after this year , 
or after tax year nineteen ninety , there's no deductions for , you know , credit card interest that you pay . 
so it's a , you know , gosh , 
credit cards run , what , anywhere from , up to eighteen , nineteen percent , i guess . 
it's just a bad deal . 
course , there are emergencies , you know , that you , you know , probably need to have a card . 
i have one card . 
that's probably enough . 
and i try not to use it , 
you know , to do that or , you know , to abuse it , 
it really is . 
it's so easy to pull out the plastic , 
but we're trying our best not to add any , you know , credit card debt to our structure here . 
um , i have , uh , 
the thing that bothers me worse than the credit cards , i think , is , uh , you mentioned the gasoline credit card . 
i don't have that , 
but i've got , you know , one of the instant teller cards 
and we use that usually to buy gasoline , 
i'm sure you're right . 
i don't participate in that , 
 but , you know , a lot of folks do . 
at least with the , uh , gasoline company credit cards you have , you know , up to thirty , twentyfive , thirty days , you know , interest free for it . 
but , you know , the instant thing you know , to replace checks and every other thing . 
that's what they've talked about it . 
course it eliminates any waiting period . 
it certainly does . 
god help those people who have to float checks occasionally 
that's right . 
do you get any sort of discount when you use a card like that ? 
i see . 
oh , it was , well , 
they consider it to be the same as cash 
i see , 
it certainly is , 
it's better than cash .
they don't even have to deposit it , 
it just goes straight in there . 
that's right . 
no returned checks or anything . 
i understand it's becoming , you know , the popular thing to do . 
we're not participating in that particular program at the moment , 
and i don't really perceive doing it unless we absolutely have to . 
but , uh , i have in times past gotten into a bit of trouble with credit cards .
it's just , you know , too easy to do . 
but i'm so glad he told me they got to such a point with their credit cards they didn't want to cut them up because they were afraid sometime they might actually need them . 
that's right . 
they paid them off , 
and then they stuck them in a thing of water and froze them . 
she said at least before she could use them she'd have to thaw them out . 
i mean , that's funny . 
well , that's a novel idea . 
that would cause you think a little while , wouldn't it . 
that may not be a bad idea . 
but i'm kind of getting a little more leery of credit cards , you know , as time goes by . 
unless you just absolutely have to . 
now , there are times when you'd 
i want to still have just one 
but , i'd 
that's right . 
my wife and i really , i guess are fortunate . 
we're really not compulsive shoppers , you know . 
we plan purchases , you know , pretty well , you know , watch for the best buys , things like that . 
but , uh , some people have a real problem with it . 
well , our limit is , you know , fairly low 
 and , uh , so that's one thing that's good . 
was nice talking to you . 
take care . 
all right . 
well , um , we lived , 
i grew up in san antonio , 
and i was used to the heat , 
and i was used to what couldn't grow down there , 
and we had a small , um , farm house out in castroville which is just , uh , to the west of san antonio 
 and we did a lot of gardening out there , and , uh , mostly in raised beds so we could keep the , uh , soil nice , because basically out there it was mostly a clay soil , very hard to grow , very hard to cultivate , 
and when we came up , here , uh , to california , uh , we're in the monterrey area , 
and it's very , uh , nice sandy soil , rich soil , 
and the weather is perfect for growing just about anything you want to grow 
how fine . 
and we've been uh , planting flowers that we could never plant ,
 and here they are supposed to last year around 
oh boy . 
and , uh , we're at the edge of a forest area , so there's a lot of pine mulch .
just about anything you would want in texas as a gardener is here just around us . 
we got here at the end of about a four year drought . 
we've had a whole lot of rain . 
uh , it's been raining pretty much continually now , uh , off and on , maybe one day of break , for about a month . 
oh really . 
and so there is , 
when i first came here everything was yellow , 
the grass was dead everywhere . 
and now with all the rain everything is just gorgeous , lush and green and beautiful , 
and i hope that it holds out here after the summer . 
but , uh , that has been the major change that we have noticed in gardening , 
and that's about the extent of what we've done , just a little bit on the patio , and waiting for the rain to subside so we can mow . 
we finally got to mow this weekend . 
but , um , we're just so happy to see green . 
it's just so nice . 
we haven't really done too much else other than that . 
um . well we just moved to our first home , 
and we had lived in a condominium before . 
so we didn't have any lawn and garden type duties . 
so we're just learning the ropes here 
but when we moved in , um , 
our backyard has so many there wasn't even a blade of grass in the backyard . 
so we're , you know , talking to some of our friends that are landscapers and things , and learning about different kinds of grass . 
we trying to go , grow grass , 
and it just seems so funny to me that , when i grew up in missouri , 
and you didn't have to worry about growing grass there . 
it just happened automatically . 
so do you have to get a shade tolerant grass ? 
is that what you're , 
we planted some fescue last , um , fall 
 and it's really , really pretty , 
it stayed pretty green throughout the winter , 
and it's pretty goo , 
it's not as thick and as nice , 
it doesn't look like it can withstand too much , you know . 
does that last through the summer , too ? 
it's supposed to die off like in august , 
and then you replant it in september 
the saint augustine and all that supposedly was back there just wasn't , 
like i say , there really wasn't even one blade of grass in the backyard . 
just get grass to grow . 
let's get grass so that the kids can play in the yard and not have to be worried about the dirt so much . you know . 
well , when we .
oh yeah . 
to water it 
 uh , and eventually , well , especially when it was so bad last year , well , i guess it was the year before now , uh , it was so hot that year , 
that was the year that i think it started out a hundred in february . 
oh no . 
um , we were just watering all the time . 
it's going to have to do whatever it's going to do because ,
on its own , 
and so when we left , you know , the back yard had some , um , 
i think it was saint augustine that we had . 
it had held onto a small portion , 
but primarily once the weeds start in the back we were just , you know , resigned to , well , the only way we were going to fix this one is that if you plow it all under 
but , i don't know . 
that's the bad thing there , is , that we spent so much money , 
or you would spend so much money trying to keep a large lawn alive . 
that was the only thing i didn't like about lawns , 
it's pretty remarkable because growing up we've always had a beautiful , lush green lawn , 
and we never , 
there was no such thing as watering your lawns 
it just happened . 
and , um , so it's been real fun here to see , 
there's a big market for the nurseries and for the landscaping companies , 
and a lot of people , um , 
we live in north of dallas . 
and , um , 
arlington area . 
plano . 
up north .
and so there's a lot of market up here since it's kind of the area that people are moving into in the dallas area 
i imagine .
so , well it seems like everyone is so particular , especially in the dallas area . 
there's so much money 
and everyone can afford , 
they have enough leisure time to afford a nice lawn . 
and , another thing i've noticed is that the lawns in some of the homes 
the area is so small 
they do . 
i noticed that they're really putting in small back yards , because most of the houses have the alleys 
and , so that really cuts into your backyard space , 
and . but we don't do our work here out of enjoyment so much as 
right now , we just moved in in september , 
so we're just still at the point where we're talking about the necessity . 
i know . 
oh , it's awful the first house . 
our house in castroville was the first one , too . 
and we had no idea the expense that lawns and gardening would run into 
and then when it comes to fertilize , then it would come to raking , 
and then when it comes to making sure that somebody had put the timer on the water . 
and the one thing that i did notice is that people that have the underground irrigation systems , the sprinkler systems , that was the way to go 
people that were building the new homes that put those in , that was the only way to go because it was just so convenient . 
they would just turn it on 
and the timer would run 
and it would water their lawn 
and they didn't have to worry about it at all . 
and that was so nice . 
but , we didn't have that luxury , 
so we were dragging the sprinkler around everywhere . 
and so , i hope you can find , uh , 
i don't know what type of grass grows in the real shady areas . 
i remember the guy that was on the radio , um , 
they had a gardener , 
and he , 
i don't know , 
well i've still got the book . 
um , i think it's just called texas gardening , 
and it talks about the different grasses to use for the shady areas versus the really sunny areas . 
but there is a grass that you can use that is shade tolerant , 
but i don't remember what it is . 
but it's got like a boot , on the front of the book . 
it's just a real fancy decorated boot . 
it's like texas gardening . 
and it talks about , you know , different problems that your lawn can have and how to recognize it 
and it goes into the full gamut of gardening . you know , everything from flowers to bulbs to perennials to grass to weeds to trees and uh , how to prune . 
but one of the things i do remember was when it talked about the grass ,
grass , 
and i think one of them was a blend of two types of grass that they had used . 
but or what . 
or what it was . 
but i do remember they had used a blend . 
well , we're going to have to do that because have the shade , the trees , 
this is an established and older home that we moved into , 
and , um , the trees are just so tall 
and there must be ten or twelve big tall trees out there so that like even if its raining , you can .
oh , but that's so neat , because so many homes don't have that . 
so you'll be cool all year around , 
in the summer , that's great . 
well , that's what we're looking forward to , 
and that's what they say the payoff is 
it makes the biggest difference ,
well , we ha , 
and the people that moved in next to us , they built a new house on the empty lot 
and they just had their brand new little trees . 
they didn't have any shade .
any time they had people over they had to do it on the patio because it just got too hot during the day . 
too hot , 
so , oh , that's great that you have them . 
are they oaks ? 
well , there are all different kinds . 
oh that's even better . 
there are some oaks , magnolias , and like plum trees , peach trees , 
there are some big tall oak trees  . . . 
uh , so , you have children i take it ? 
you don't ? 
so , it's not a very valid topic . 
it's not . 
do you have children ? 
uh , yes . 
one . 
ten . 
and , uh , you know how they are at that age , i guess .
once upon a time i was . 
well , i have two dogs , 
those are my kids . 
oh , we have one . 
 what kind is it ? 
a keeshonden . 
oh , really . 
fuzzy little thing . 
a what ? 
they're cute . 
rather odd personality , 
he's fun . 
anyway , uh , time we spend with our children . 
it seems almost as though children hate it . 
do they ? 
time spent with mom and dad is probably one of the worst punishments spent on earth to them . 
especially when they get like into the teenage stage . 
i guess . 
i remember when i was that age . 
they , you know , 
parents are a curse that they just have to live with . 
 so , it's interesting . 
but we do spend time driving in the mountains , 
and  . . . 
oh , how nice , 
i would love to live up there . 
do you work for t i ? 
you're working then ? 
with every passing day we wonder if we will be . 
that's what i heard . 
i've always thought about maybe transferring up there , 
and i thought if i do that , i might not have a job 
it's better to be employed . 
especially these days where there is not a job right around the corner . 
i know it . 
and that creates family tensions . 
i'm sure it does . 
 so , you only have the stepdaughter at home ? 
you all don't have any other children around there ? 
i don't have any , children . 
so , how does she feel about going out and doing stuff with you all . 
 uh , well it varies what it is , of course , 
but usually ,
you know , they'd much rather be with friends , 
oh , yeah .
friends are cool , parents aren't . 
well , i remember , 
well i'm sure part of it is a male , female thing , you know , 
i remember whenever i was growing up , often times spent with my dad was , oh , just wonderful , you know , go , 
and we'd have , um , great times , 
oh , yeah . 
and it seems that well now the bank's not available . 
 and , entirely too much time is spent , 
my wife and i were wondering what if , 
 and what if's always rough . 
oh , yeah . 
but , you know , we do have our trips 
and we do have our fun 
like fishing and  . . . 
hunting and , 
my husband will say that he'd like to have a little boy to take hunting and fishing 
uh , but they don't like it . 
there is a difference there . 
and  . . . 
if my dad had done that when i was a kid i probably wouldn't have liked it . 
i go now , with my husband . 
and , i enjoy it , 
but  . . . 
well , girls at that age ,
not necessarily in that order ,
and , that's a little tough for fathers . 
i imagine . 
fathers don't even like malls , 
they despise shopping . 
so , is that quality time ? 
i think not . 
but there is camping 
and we both enjoy that . 
she likes to do that ? 
somewhat , yeah , 
well , that's good . 
getting up in the mountains and getting away from it all 
she  . . . 
it's  , 
so what do you think about child rearing ? 
how would you spend time with kids ? 
probably doing outdoorsie stuff , and trying to keep them away from the t v , i guess .
oh , yeah . 
i always said that if i had a kid they wouldn't know what mcdonald's is . 
 but  , they learn from their friends , 
don't they ? 
well , yeah , 
you know , a lot of times , whenever we head out of town on a trip or something ,
breakfast and run . 
and breakfast is a kind of a funny meal anyway , 
it is . 
and , uh , kids eat funny . 
this lady in our bass club , we had a tournament yesterday 
and she was talking about her daughter , said , one week her daughter will , uh , be on a no meat kick , 
and one week she'll eat nothing but twix candy bars , you know , 
she just eats weird . 
and little girls are worse about it than little boys . 
they  . . . 
they're always wanting to go on a diet or something . 
go on a diet or they have a , well , 
to some extent the public schools , or the schools in general ,
you know , like it's really morally wrong to eat meat or something ,
of course , that's not the way i was raised , being raised in west texas . 
oh , is that where you're from ? 
oh , yeah . 
born in denton , raised in lubbock . 
oh . um . 
so , i understand about bass . 
but it is interesting , 
i will tell you , 
every person out there should have kids , at least once or have some they can borrow for a time ,
my mother used to put that curse on my sister . 
i hope you have kids just like yourself . 
 and , my grandmother must have put that on my dad because he got my sister , 
she's just like him . 
uh . but , jenny is a sweet kid . 
i'm sure she is . 
and , yeah , 
we do do things , 
and , it's funny , 
it's almost like a lot of things that were available to us as children ,
the money's not available . 
i know , 
i don't know how people can afford kids . 
 i mean  . . . 
 you know  , we were talking about how much it cost to go to disney land . 
a couple , 
three hundred dollars . 
oh , yeah . 
you know , you know , a day or two , not including lodging and food and all that . 
i don't see how anyone can afford it . 
and , i understand six flags is real expensive now . 
it's , uh , 
i heard it's twenty bucks a whack . 
for adults . 
oh , yeah . 
that is awful high . 
oh , well  . . . 
twenty bucks a whack now . 
or twentyone . 
but , at least once you pay your way in there ,
everything's free except for the food . 
food and junk to carry out . 
 so that's not as bad . 
you know , disney world or disney land . 
well , our problem is that , you know , a trip to six flags or disney world or , uh , disney land , or god forbid , disney world , would take forever . 
or you'd have to pay air fare , 
and , ooh , you know , for a family it gets pretty expensive pretty quick . 
oh , yeah . 
rent a car when you get there and all that . 
that's why i lucked out , 
my dad worked for braniff when i was a kid so we got , you know , our air fare free 
and we got  . . . 
my hobby is , uh , sewing . 
i've just , uh , started learning how to sew 
and , uh , i've taken some classes 
and i've made a few garments . 
do you sew at all ? 
did you ? 
i sewed , you know , in high school 
and when i went to college i think everything in my closet , i had made . 
but i haven't sewed since then 
and that's been fifteen years . 
so , uh , you know , i didn't have access to a machine the whole time i was in college . 
and , uh , my sister sewed 
and she needed the money so i would pay her 
and she'd make my clothes .
uh , and then just in the last , you know , ten or twe , i just haven't sewn anything . 
i would like to get back to it . 
uh , clothes are getting so expensive now in the stores 
and is sometimes so poor that ,
it is , you know , an even back then , 
i remember you could make something for , you know , half what it cost to buy 
and , of course , the quality was just exceptional . 
right an , 
uh , now it's a little more expensive to make it , because , you know , you start paying the price for the patterns and the material , 
but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it . 
it certainly is , 
and the patterns have gone up tremendously , too , the prices for them , you used to could get , you know , a pattern for two or three dollars , now , they're like , you know , five , six , seven , eight . 
you're kidding me . 
oh , no , 
see i can remember paying seventyfive cents for a pattern .
five dollars ,
and then you get into the vogues , 
they get up into twelve and fifteen and ,
good night . 
well do you have kids and a husband , 
are you sewing for a whole family 
uh , right now i'm just sewing for myself . 
they're grown now though . 
i wish that i had started sewing , you know , when they were younger . 
and , uh , it would have helped me out tremendously .
but , um , oh , i guess , i have always tried to sew 
and , uh , i didn't like the way it looked so i'd never wear anything . 
but now have bought some , uh , new , sewing equipment . 
i bought the singer machine 
and i've taken some classes here in , uh , dallas . 
well and that always is helpful for starters . 
you know you have to have something that kind of gets you on the right track of where you're going . 
i know a lot of people where i work make their clothes . 
there's just so many people sewing now days . 
that's true . 
well do you do anything el , 
do you knit or crochet like for sweaters or anything like that ? 
see , i've not ever been a real craft type person . 
i have a sisterinlaw that , i mean , if it can be done with your hands , she does it . 
she makes things for the kids for christmas and nephews and nieces 
and i look at them 
i have a sister that can , uh , crochet real well ,
and she knits things like hats ,
well , oh , when my sister had her first , uh , child , my niece ,
and i asked my roommate if she would teach me how to crochet granny squares . 
so she did , 
and i crocheted a blanket for my sister's baby , 
and i started crocheting a king size bedspread for a guy that i was dating at the time . 
and when we broke things off , 
actually we were supposed to get married when i got out of college . 
so when we broke things off , i quit crocheting it 
and i've never picked up a needle since then , 
in fact , i think it's still sitting in the top of the closet .
oh , my goodness . 
one of these days i keep thinking i'm going to finish it because it would make a really pretty bedspread .
now they have the , uh , knitting machines that will do it for you . 
my problem , i guess is time , you know , 
i talk to my husband , 
we kind of planning for the time eventually when , you know , maybe i can quit work , my kids are young . 
i have a three and a half and a two year old . 
and he says 
but bev , i think you'll be so bored , because , you know , all you've ever done is work . 
i'd like to start sewing again , 
i'd like to learn how to do this cross stitch and these , you know , knit these things 
and i think that would be fascinating . 
he kind of laughs .
are you familiar with what a serger is , uh , the serger sewing machine ? 
well you know , when we used to sew , we'd sew the seam 
and then we'd finish the edges , 
and we would , uh , trim the seams and finish the edges . 
well , this machine does it all in one step . 
you're kidding , 
so like as you're sewing the seam , it's finishing off the inside edge . 
and it's cutting off the , uh , 
there are two knives 
and it cuts off the , uh , you know excess seam allowance . 
well that takes all the work out of it . 
 and , uh , it really makes it look professional . 
well , how neat . 
especially , on , you know , i mean from the inside , you know how you look under , under something that you've made 
and it doesn't really , 
well that's neat . 
they're pretty expensive . 
i like , 
i paid like about eight hundred dollars for mine , 
for the machine , 
so , since i bought it and paid that much for it , i guess i'd might as well get some use out of it . 
 you have to learn how to do it . 
that's right . 
i'm going to have to do it . 
now i bought you that machine .
well that sounds really good . 
do you paint or anything like that ? 
i play the piano . 
oh , so do i . 
oh , you do . 
well i have one here , 
it's the one that i grew up with , 
and my folks gave it to me , 
and , uh , a couple years ago when they sail , 
and so they sold their home 
and they've been sailing , 
and , uh , so it's here 
but i haven't touched one like since college , so i kind of am picking it all out again and trying to remember how to do it again . 
and of course , my kids jump in the middle of it and want to pound on it 
and i'd love to teach them to play , too . 
so , i'm not great , 
but i remember it . 
well i'm not that great either . 
i used to be a lot better than i am now . 
i have played for , uh , the church choir , 
and , uh , 
and , but , you know , i don't practice a lot anymore , 
and , uh , you know , you get rusty . 
you really , 
you do , 
i never thought i would get rusty , 
but i'm rusty now . 
well , i figure it takes practice 
and i say i don't have the time , 
that's not true . 
by the time i put my kids in bed at night , i don't want to do anything . 
you know , i've worked all day 
and i come home 
and i do that , 
i have an hour here . 
i don't want to do them sometimes , 
i'm too tired . 
so , i try to save that for the weekend . 
i need to get better at it though .
well , sewing does takes an awful lot of time . 
now the part about sewing that i never liked was laying out the material and the pattern and cutting it out . 
if somebody would lay it out for me , then i didn't mind cutting it out and sewing it . 
i could do that all day long 
and i can remember once in high school , i wanted some extra money , 
and my mom wanted some pants , 
so she laid out the material 
and i cut it and sewed it 
and she paid me i think like two dollars a pair to make her some pants . 
but i hate laying out material and trying to get the most out of the material and ,
on the , 
on the grain of the fabric . 
it drives me crazy .
that's the part that i don't like , too . 
sewing up the garment itself . 
i really like to do that , 
but all the , 
even the cutting i don't like . 
well what are some of the other features on this machine ? 
it sounds wonderful . 
well that's about it really . 
the regular basic two threads . 
oh , okay . 
and , uh , it , 
is that for designs , 
or is that for the regular seam in the fabric 
oh , okay . 
uh , they're loopers under the bottom 
and then there's a seam stitch 
and it's the loopers that form you know that edge finish . 
and , uh , that's what really makes it look professional . 
you can do a lot with the serger though . 
you can make , uh , piping and cording 
and , uh , you can use all kinds of different , uh , textures of thread . 
so it has the ability to do just about any type of sewing you want to do . 
well , yes , 
but you have to use it in combination with a sewing machine . 
you can't throw your sewing machine away . 
you need it to do things like button holes ,
so the serger is not a sewing machine , itself . 
it's something that goes with it ? 
it's , uh , 
like an attachment 
it's not exactly a sewing machine 
but it does sew the seam and trim the edges and all that stuff , 
but there are other things that a regular sewing machine does that it doesn't do . like you can't top stitch with it . 
oh , okay . 
or , um , few things that you just can't do with it . 
it will also do a rolled edge , um , 
gee , it's just so versatile , 
i rem , uh . 
well i'm going to have to go check it out . 
that's just something i hadn't heard of 
but it , 
so , uh , what do you think ? .
i think we're overtaxed to the hilt . 
i mean , we're taxed on taxes 
and , um , uh , most all government entities are just trying to give us a state income tax for those who don't have it that is . 
i mean we don't have one yet , 
but eventually they may try to push it through . 
oh really . 
so they have n , 
i didn't realize they had no state tax in texas . 
no state income tax . 
oh , that's great , because they don't have it in florida . 
in new york they have it . 
i mean , you know , like i say , i'm in new york 
and we have a state tax as well . 
so that just cuts even more . 
i think what needs to be done is they need to control their spending habits . 
i think that i , 
i mean , i wouldn't be so upset about the amount of taxes paid if it weren't for the fact that they don't go to any place . 
you know , you don't see it going to any place where it belongs . 
but given that it's not spent properly , i think it's a major problem . 
well we're really overburdened from federal , state and local ,
well that's certainly true . 
well what is it they were just talking about , um , sort of how , middle income people , 
what winds up happening is , for instance having kids , you know , they wind up having kids as a deduction 
 but the deduction is so little for kids that they wind up having to pay more in taxes than it costs to raise a kid for the year or something . 
i think tha , 
so they want i think they're trying , 
i think that most of the politicians understand this . 
they're just not very good at doing what they're supposed to be doing . 
well they're kind of put into a trap of being out there to please the special interest groups as well . 
and , uh , i think the only way that can be changed for us to get a better tax revenue that's fairness and all , is for us to limit their terms . 
and by doing so , they're not obligated to anybody . 
i agree , 
and , uh , i don't know how we're going to do that right away though , 
but , what in general though that taxes are doing to us is , it's just taking , uh , a bite out of our savings . 
you know , if i see it going , like i say to the right places . 
i mean , it'd be one thing if it were taking a bite out of your savings and then you were getting it all back when you got older . 
you know , but i'm not convinced , and that , you know , those people who need it for welfare and so forth , who really need it for welfare , not the eightyfive to ninety percent of them who don't need it . but i mean the real people who really need it , you know , should be getting it 
but instead i think it's going to the wrong places . 
and i believe the social security tax is a great   scheme . 
you think so ? 
it's , uh , you know , 
right now , they're robbing from it to pad the federal deficit . 
i know 
and that scares the hell out of me . 
that's illegal , see . 
if , uh , most company , uh , c e o s were to do that within their private company , they'd be in jail . 
 so how are we letting them get away with it . 
i don't , 
it'd be nice if we sort of , as one , band together 
performed a citizens arrest , i guess . 
to see if we could sort of clean them up 
and you know , but i don't know if we can do that or not . 
a lot of people have become too complacent and believe everything is just the norm as to the way things are going and feel absolutely helpless to oppose a lot of the situations going on ,
i agree , 
but , um , yeah , 
if it's certainly not going to be a slow change process 
and i wonder if it'll ever be a change process . 
i sort of get discouraged when i think about all the things that i think are wrong .
you know , all those things that really could be changed that aren't . 
and tax is one of those things that just sort of sits way up there on the list . 
so , i don't kno , 
i have no idea what to do about it . 
well there's no quick solution , or no sure fire easy answer . 
it's just going to take , uh , uh , really , uh , uh , uh , a combination effort , i think , of the majority of the american people to come to a decisive answer ,
 see , we have no say so as to where the money goes in the first place . 
we don't , 
i mean , the only say so we have is supposedly by electing people who we think are going to vote one way of another . 
and they are controlled , or pretty much do what they want to do . 
i've never quite understood that . i've never been , uh , sort of politically minded , 
but it's never been clear to me as to sort of , um , you know , how congressmen doesn't back them up on anything , you know . 
and often times that will happen . 
well they feel invulnerable to , uh , any wrath 
and generally it does work out that way . 
they do forget , it's true , because everybody , 
think of what happens is the one who made that supposed mistake turns around 
so it becomes , uh , a general battle of the sort of the election of the lesser of two evils , i think , 
i don't know , 
uh , i'm unhappy with it 
and well , i'm sort of semifortunate right now , 
i'm a graduate student , 
so i don't make that much , 
 and what i make isn't taxed very highly because i'm still in school . 
well when you get out into the real world then you'll know . 
but my wife has a real job 
and , you know , when i get her job , um , you know , we look at her paycheck , i'm just floored when i see how little of it we're actually allowed to keep . 
 especially around bonus time . 
bonus time , 
you have a bonus ? 
bonus , 
my wi , 
i don , 
we're lucky to get paychecks the way i figure . 
so you're taxed on the bonuses too , 
my wife is taxed on her bonus as well , 
and that's usually a big chunk of her bonus check actually . 
i mean her bonus isn't that much , 
but they tax it as , 
i guess they tax it as if that were her weekly check or something . 
so she gets destroyed on her bonus check . 
so , she works in sales . 
so a good portion of is quarterly bonuses . 
uh , sales is lucrative 
but then you're paying really high taxes when you're doing a lucrative job . 
well , yeah , 
she's not entirely sales , so it isn't as lucrative as one would hope , 
but , it keeps us supported temporarily ,
so , i don't know , 
i guess at this point in time we're just sort of going to have to live with it , .
same here , 
i beli , 
most wholeheartedly . 
well that's great . 
it's been a pleasure talking with you . 
you too , 
and , uh , 
thanks for call . 
have a good day . 
you too . 
he did really decide to go ? 
i'm familiar with it , 
and it was a very difficult choice 
he must have a definite profession in mind . 
oh , okay , 
medium size , 
aren't they ? 
is he excited ? 
very excited , 
i can , 
while they're east coast , i mean , i don't know anything about their football , 
but there you go . 
well , they're really very strong academic rather than , you know , big sports , 
where you at ? 
we're outside of , uh , washington in maryland . 
how about you ? 
oh , okay , 
i'm in , uh , suburban dallas . 
do you have children in , 
i have a husband .
we don't have any kids yet . 
okay , um , 
about all i can say is i guess about picking schools , um , i guess , uh , if you don't know what you're going to do , liberal arts program is a good idea . 
well , i , 
one of the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job 
this is true , 
 uh , but what you can't learn , uh , on a job , is a good solid wellrounded education . 
the humanities , the history , yeah , 
that's right , you know , 
the renaissance man 
 uh , and if you get that you can , 
and if you do well , you can learn a job , 
but you know , if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school 
that's exactly right . 
that's right . 
this is true , 
and if you want to go away , 
do you want to go away , 
how far from home do you want to be . 
what do you want in a college . 
now my son is a national level competitive swimmer 
 so he wanted to swim in school , 
but he did not want to be in a swim factory . 
so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at , in austin , texas , university of texas , 
that's right , 
that's the university of texas at austin , or 
texas aqua , 
well i think the other thing is , too , um , i know i went to a , uh , city high school in chicago 
 and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say , my brother and i were , 
and economics was the choice 
 um , sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school . 
he is very , very strong academically , 
so , we've just , 
but , you know , he had to look to see 
and yet he did wind up having to make a choice . 
he did apply to a large , you know , large group , 
university of penn , 
i'm originally from pennsylvania . 
university of pennsylvania , 
it's got about nine thousand undergraduate . 
that's strong , 
i mean that's 
 and well , it's a little bit , i don't want to use the word wilder , that's not the word i want . um , more diverse  , 
but it does have the under , you know , 
that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school , so that the , uh , the college of arts and sciences is , you know , i guess about four thousand . 
at williams , 
at pennsylvania . 
at pennsylvania . 
well how large is williams ? 
williams is an undergraduate school only 
 um , and it's a total of two thousand . 
well that's not bad . 
so he knew the feeling because my other son is at amherst which is 
which is a lot , 
 and he had visited his brother at amherst and knew 
 but he did go on college visits , 
and he liked , 
that's the thing to do , 
i mean , not having any children , my husband was an ohio state person , 
and , uh , that has something like either the first or second largest student population , like fifty thousand . 
combined   .
it's large , 
and both boys had decided no , that they did not want that . 
that is too much , 
and i mean , um , i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at bennington in vermont , 
oh , it's , 
so you , 
um , and this was twenty years ago .
showing my age , 
and did you ever eat at the blue bin diner ? 
where are you from , 
well , let's not talk about that .
but we've been there when   whose gone up there . 
it's , um , in that area . 
i mean i just can't say enough about it . 
oh , it   
we went 
and he was , you know , impressed by the clean air 
and he met the students at both schools 
and he liked them . 
well you know , um , my husband's an engineer and    , a strong liberal arts background with , uh , a graduate degree in a technical field 
that's it . 
the thing is if a person really knows very early on 
and they usually ,
 but they usually don't . 
but , uh , if you're going into , 
if you know engineering is the thing then you've got to at least take engineering . 
but they , 
but who does . 
i mean , i think , 
that's right . 
he looked at criteria such as location , size of school 
he didn't apply to any school further , 
the furthest away was bowdoin , in maine which is about twelve hours . 
that's still pretty far though . 
i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go , 
that was the furthest and then kenyon in ohio which was about six and a half hours 
and williams is about seven . 
oh , that's not too bad . 
so , well , i mean he , so it wasn't , 
he , you know , 
then the university of pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train 
and then bucknell in midstate pennsylvania . 
he will enjoy williams i think and   is a good academic , 
and he will , 
and he came , 
he's been talking to them 
and one of the things that he said is , he went to pennsylvania this weekend 
and he had an absolutely marvelous time 
he had a great time 
that could very well be 
and he said it almost back , 
i think it backfired . 
that's good because 
well actually that's one of the reasons i went to    , 
kenyon , he made a good choice . 
i went , 
well   i was supposed to , 
but i spent a year in vermont , my freshman year , 
it was just too far away , 
it was too different 
and their attitudes was just , um , beyond my ,
of course , that period too was probably difficult . 
you're right 
but then i went , 
but i did , uh , 
my advice to him ,
he had to look at himself . 
uh , in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it , he could probably slip 
and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school 
and you're going to get a little bit more input than 
and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you , uh , 
and he will know the professors in a small , 
well i don't know how to put this either in this way 
and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this 
but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today , i think the refinement that they get 
that's right , 
and , um , 
um , and it's just the personal contact where if you need help 
that's right . 
he had , 
i told him to look to yourself . 
are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred 
right   .
 but if it's a class of fifteen 
this is very , very , 
 and even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having 
they have video lectures . 
video lectures . 
they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups . 
this is true , 
and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the , 
did he just make the decision today ? 
  he made the decision , uh , i'd say , about , uh , an hour and a half ago .
how funny .
i mean , that's so funny . i mean , 
and , in fact , he had just an hour before that two , uh , recent graduates from kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him 
that's funny . 
they were really nice , 
that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know , 
but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better . 
it was easy for him to rule out . 
he knew what he didn't want 
that's exactly , 
now is your other , 
i mean we're talking about what you think , 
but obviously you're experiencing it . uh , 
did your other son , um , 
my other son is just as happy as a bed bug . 
the moment he knew , he decided early on that amherst was the school . 
he's a classical guitarist 
oh , wonderful . 
 and he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate 
but he decided he was going to go to um 
the smaller and the , 
and they'll do fine in their studies , 
and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school , 
well , my older boy's real happy , 
and he's minoring in english , 
and he had thought about economics , 
and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't , 
or is this early admissions ? 
um , he's going to be a junior . 
he'll be , he's finishing his sophomore year 
so he's , 
well sounds like you have two talented sons . 
well , you know , see the advice we give is to not limit yourself , especially this , you know , go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two . 
i think , and a lot of people talk about , 
and it's not the economics i solely zeroed in on , 
but i think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return 
 and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller colleges because of that , 
and i think it's rather sad , 
well , one of the things we said is that they should pick the college , 
this was our advice , too , irrespective of the cost . that somehow we would manage . 
you are wonderful parents .
well , we place a real high priority on education in our family . 
and i agree , 
i mean , my husband and i , 
in fact , i'm taking my l s a t s , um , 
i'm thirty something 
oh , good , 
that's wonderful . 
oh , that's great . 
the point being , and your sons will learn this from you , i'm sure , that , uh , no matter what age you are , you can learn 
that's right , 
that's exactly , 
 and , it sounds like they're going to , you know , they're , 
one , uh , big thing that , the advise that i would give to a parent to give to his or her child is to let their child experience college in a kind of general sense . 
i like large colleges because i went to university of texas at austin , 
they have fifty thousand students there . 
and i feel like that now uh , i don't know , different languages , different cultures , and things like that just by being around those fifty thousand students . 
that's interesting , 
i went to a smaller school ,
and i thought that was the best experience in that we had more oneonone since we seemed to know everyone on campus , 
 and we had a broad spectrum of languages and cultures and backgrounds ,
 so , i thought it was wonderful to be a bigger fish and not so much a number , 
 um , one of fifty thousand , i was one of three thousand ,
i , uh , 
but it sounds like we were both kind of looking at the same sort of thing . 
i could see how it would be . 
i'm sure your classes were a lot smaller , um , because like we would have main courses that everyone has to take , i mean , hundreds of students in this class , 
but , um , i just , 
i don't know , 
i'm thinking in a sense of , uh , just being exposed to more . 
it just seems like in a larger college i don't know , your exposed to so many more people from all over the world , 
and i'm sure a lot of people come to , you know , small colleges also but just that they're more of the different cultures there , 
not that it's better 
but i'm just saying that i think that big , 
that's one thing to definitely consider . 
i think , uh , a lot of students now would probably be afraid of a smaller college , 
a lot of the students that i talked to even here in waco they go to baylor , um , 
or they're considering going to baylor , 
they're also considering going to u t austin 
but one of the big nonos is because of the fifty thousand students , 
and i have to tell them that just like i live in waco 
it's a large city ,  , 
i can still function ,  , in my own kind of area , in my own group . 
i have a job , 
i have my friends , 
 and i'm really not a big university , you're not as concerned  , about the entire university ,
i think that's probably keyed to me is not so much the size the school ,
and whereas some would immediately feel very comfortable in this , um , larger university setting ,
 and so maybe to me the key would be the students needs , 
but it's these other things that you and i are keying off on ,
but they're the things that don't show up in , 
on paper . 
that's right , 
that's one important thing that i think about school . 
i'm not a kind a person that , 
i didn't , 
i was kind of a b student , i guess you'd say , 
and i didn't really , 
i was tur , 
i strived to be an a student 
but it wasn't like a real priority . 
to my priority was just being as worldly as i could possibly be  , getting into as many organizations as i possibly could , 
i  can  see that probably if i had gone to a smaller school , i would probably have more friends ,
 and so , you probably come out of it knowing , and by friends , i mean , like contacts for when you get out of school , um , you know , 
you may walk into a company and see someone you went to school with ,
but you wouldn't know them . 
uh , i guess , let me think of another important thing to look at when you look into college , um , 
i guess now i've been out for , 
i'm older than you . 
i've been out for twentyone years . 
and i was looking at an annual last night , 
it sparked a question , 
and i went to a small private school , 
 um , and it was church related . 
and i got to looking at my class of sixtynine , 
 and i realized that even though that school's two hundred miles from here 
and i've lived in other states and done other things for the past twenty years , where i go to church now , there are five other people that went to school at the same time in the same class as i , 
 and it's neat to know that we have that contact that goes back that some of the same memories if not the same education in , 
 you know , we weren't all out to be teachers or whatever 
so we didn't have the same classes , 
but we had a common thread ,
that's great . 
and it's kind of neat just knowing that those kinds of things , those are what i carry beyond that piece of paper that allows me to be an exempt at t i , 
i have something more important to me than that . 
that's great , 
that's basically what i , and , when i first , 
i've been out of college  only  two years now ,  , so it's still pretty fresh on my memory ,
 but now that i'm out , 
when i went into school , my parents told , well , 
okay , my sister now is in college ,
and i kept pushing her towards just kind of u t or a larger school , 
and it was just a big conflict between us because my father wanted the academics 
and i wanted her to get the life experience ,
and so it was , you know , 
she went the academic way because she's a straight a student , which is , 
i was going to ask who won .
so , she , you know , 
that's probably , you know , what she wants anyway 
but that was the big deal 
in that case , uh , regardless of what you or your father pushed for it sounds like she was going for what she needed ,
and or to give their child the leeway to choose their school ,
i think it helps , 
now my grandfather was going to pay if i went to , uh , what's now u t arlington ,
i could live at home . 
but i chose to go to another school 
and even though he was pleased that it was a church related school , he was not willing to pay any at all even the same amount of money , 
 and i think i value my education more because i had to work for it . 
and because i knew all along that's what i wanted ,
well , that was pretty courageous .
um , it was my mother's support that got me through it ,
 oh , yeah , 
i'm dealing with the loans right now , 
it's very fresh in your memory . 
every month .
that memory just seeps back in my mailbox . 
oh , well , i guess i'll get over it . 
i'm sure it was worth it though . 
oh , yeah , 
if nothing else because i work in training at t i now , 
if nothing else just those experiences beyond and including your educational classes that help give you the selfesteem to do and achieve ,
 and the potential to do whatever you wanted . 
because that's what you need the most . 
i'm finding out now that what i'm needing the most now is not smarts , not what i can do on paper , it's stamina , courage , uh ,    , 
young lady , 
words , it , 
that's right . 
i'm needing to rely on myself , 
and i think i learned a lot of that in school too . 
maybe this is a fantasy we can to talk about any kind of car ,
i want a rolls royce and a cadillac .
that sounds like a great deal to me .
you have great aspirations .
well , let's see 
we just bought , uh , a seventythree mercedes that we have restored 
oh , that's great . 
 and it , 
i like to work on cars too . 
it has really been a lot of fun . 
uh , we found some guys that actually , you know , worked for a mercedes dealership 
and , uh , they also repair them for other the people on their off time 
oh , that's good . 
i don't know if i'll ever want another new car again ,
was you , 
why they didn't , 
say buy it 
that's true . 
i don't know it just seems like , uh , you know , for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more ,
oh , sure , 
a restored ,
we wanted it to be as authentic as possible 
but we did break down and put a c d player in it , 
well , that's great . 
that's not quite authentic , 
but at any rate one of the features that i did want , 
i'd passed up on one and put a sunroof in it , 
oh , yeah , 
you all ,
i had to stop there . 
when i talk about working on cars i sure don't do that . 
well , of course , we do it ourselves 
oh , okay . 
they just weren't really expensive , 
oh , that is good ,
and , uh , yeah , you know , 
and they work on it , 
so , the things that can be done here they just come here to our home and work on it or work on it , 
that's amazing . 
it's really been nice . 
we , uh , 
i do all my own work , uh , 
so , i have chevies ,
i've got three chevy v eights . 
i'm an american car person , 
you're an american car person . 
but i do like mercedes . 
american car 
and , uh , i had a real , real bad experience with the cougar that i had , 
it was an eightytwo cougar , 
and , uh , i don't know , 
i think it just soured me on it for some reason because i had trouble with it starting , 
the engine blew up in it , 
we'll try something different 
well , i'm not a ford person and never have been as a kid , 
and , uh , i do like the v eight engines 
and i think the , 
i went to the auto show with my daughter recently ,
i'm not saying that they were ,
i would that there's , 
i see a  marked  improvement ,
oh , yeah . 
i would hate to see the american car industry suffering more than it already has 
oh , yeah . 
but , uh , i think , 
not seriously thinking 
but i would like to ,
but i wouldn't ,
and , you know , of course , if i had the money i'd be happy to by a new one , 
but , uh , i do look for a one year old vehicle ,
twenty thousand , 
well , that's what my parents are avid cadillac freaks . 
they had , uh , 
and i think uh , i guess it's a couple of years old , 
and , uh , she had a seville before that that had the odd backs that was , 
oh , yeah , 
i remember those . 
and it final just wore out 
they had purchased it , 
i can't remember how many years they had that car , 
but she loved the styling of it . 
that she may want to save , if she doesn't have it anymore . 
she sold it 
and she , 
since they don't make them anymore ,
i know . 
she kept telling herself that 
i mean he came back with a new car .
he wanted  new one   , 
i think he had an ulterior motive 
he could just see , you know , dollar signs starting to flip by as far as repairs went 
but , uh , there , 
i'm still a full size person , 
and i like a full size cadillac , 
i want one of those , 
i think they are , i don't know , a classic 
but they're ,
they haven't changed in about , uh , twenty years , 
and i sure would like one ever those , uh , uh , within the next five years ,
it seems funny you how within the last couple of years cars have gotten bigger again , you know , 
they've scaled everything down so much 
and , uh , i've never owned a really large car , 
i don't know , 
i think that cougar was the biggest thing i ever had 
well , even the japanese cars are bigger too 
but , uh , 
i've never had a jap , 
now the lexus are very nice looking cars ,
i've had friends who had them , 
and i think they're a lot over ra , 
and they're is just no styling to them , 
you can't tell one japanese car from the other ,
that's true , 
that's true . 
you know , i don't mean that as a joke , 
i mean , 
and the   
i don't have any idea which car it is ,
what is what , 
and i think they have not , uh , lead the field in styling , 
they do have sports cars 
 but the price is way more , 
you can get a cadillac for ,
it's ridiculous now . 
i know that , uh , 
i've sort of always felt like with buicks it seems like all buicks to me look alike  ,
i guess it just , uh , seems to me they're all the same shape . 
i have a very good friend that has a buick regal 
and she's got way offer a hundred thousand miles on it 
and that's what she's going to buy again 
oh , yeah . 
well , if you're interested you ought to go to the next auto show . 
i look at the cadillacs 
and boy there were some cadillacs that i didn't even realize they made 
but they were ,
they were standard cadillacs 
but they really looked beautiful . 
are they still , 
are what they're , 
what they have out for like the next year , is everything still pretty square , 
it seems like the cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really , i can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the  alliance  .
oh , no , 
and they have that new , uh , 
it's not the big , uh , fleetwood , the one i want ,
there's another one that has came out in the last two year , not the seville , 
the seville is totally different , 
now at the auto show they had fantastic looking cars . 
now when was this , 
was this recently ? 
oh , yeah , 
oh , okay , 
because i have , 
well , they have it every year . 
usually when i see the new cars it's during the fair when i go to the auto building at the state fair 
and that's usually when i see anything ,
now this was , uh , in it downtown in the , uh , convention center 
oh , i see . 
they had japanese and german cars , 
they had the full  range   , 
and they had some new cars that weren't even out 
they had , uh , a new chevy suburban ,
oh , really . 
that big , big one that was , uh , 
they didn't have a price on it ,
it had a microwave in it and everything , 
oh , my word . 
it was , 
they had several futuristic cars . 
that's wild ,
you hear about things like that 
and you think that can't possibly be done , 
i mean , it just , 
i know . 
and i like engines 
they had a lot of 
so you could tell , 
see the inside of them or whatever . 
but , uh , that sold me in buying a new car , you know , 
i mean , certainly interested in buying a new car 
but again yeah , the american cars were for superior in styling and ,
and , uh , 
somebody's finally woken up , you know . 
and i could buy anything , you know . 
oh , yeah , 
i was really crazy about jags for a while 
and the convertible , had a x j s or something like that , 
and i ,
and you really would have to be a dream car because the repair bills are supposedly just constant , you know . 
well , i haven't work on them myself so you know , my cars don't go to the shop , you know , 
so , uh , 
i am the kind of engineer 
and i've always done it myself 
and , uh 
well , that's good that you can . 
and , uh , i can't remember one , 
i think i had one someone welded a muffler on for me ,
oh , really , 
oh , gosh , 
that's great . 
i think that's the only thing of the three vehicles that i've in it just the welding on 
like i said i don't do that you know . 
i think it takes a talent to do that , you know , 
my husband is , uh , engineer 
but he cannot , i mean , 
or maybe he's just doesn't want to mess with it 
that's might be part of it , 
he drives , 
i was wasn't a mechanical engineer 
but i worked my way through college as a mechanic 
i learned early from ,
and now again , i've got three vehicles 
and i never get in them and just go to the shop at you will , you know . 
well , that's one thing that when you would consider , 
i'm keeping v eight chevy engines ,
that's when you know , 
and , in fact , i stock the same part , 
i'm like a little stock , 
if you ,
that's pretty good , 
it's really been funny because we have like been you are own contractors kind of with this car 
and when i say we have redone everything i mean we have done everything , 
oh , that's great , 
and it's , 
i've always wanted to that too . 
he's gotten these catalogs try , 
it's really more difficult to find these vintage parts when you might think this is for a seventythree , 
oh , i can imagination , 
i have mixed views on all three of them . 
the lower grades , you know , k through seven ? 
 well , i should imagine the lower grades , 
what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that is the fact that , uh , many of the inner city and , uh , i guess what we'd call , uh , ghetto or poorer districts ,
they can't seem to read properly , do math ,
i , uh , 
so that's got everybody excited . 
high schools , i'm not too sure . 
it seems that high schools at least produce candidates , although i have great misgivings about the s a t s , that go on to a variety of colleges . 
it seems a great deal of our public colleges have foreign students in them , uh , from , um , a myriad of nations , 
uh , public colleges produce a fairly decent student ,
basically , they're fifty per cent foreign . h , 
 oh , i didn't realize it was that high . 
oh , just about f , 
but um , 
 well that's what i was going to point out , i think it mostly is that technical , 
especially in those areas , it's almost fifty per cent foreign , like fortyeight per cent , 
and that involves both canadian ,
um , i think i have similar views , 
that's , you know , where our elementary grades , um , 
it's amazing , 
i have a friend who's an elementary school teacher , 
and she said that they have to pat the kids down , because they bring guns to school . 
she teaches in the city ,
and that , 
that must be an inner school . 
i just read an , 
i don't know , 
i thought it was rather slanted in favor of the mayor , in there , 
i do know a few people and have been , 
but it seemed to me that the inner city school system was the one thing that didn't flower too well . 
they talked about individual cases of people trying hard , 
but it was very difficult . 
i think , if i was going to fault it , now , 
if i'm looking to carry on a conversation ,
i think when i learned the other day , uh , uh , that , uh , the average american , 
and that school children , are not far off that mark with six point eight . 
now , i don't know what school children , what year that is . 
i mean that's a hell of a lot time to be sitting in front of the tube . 
uh , uh , it's really , 
you know , kids can't read , um , 
well , i , 
it's really , 
you know by the time ,
my wife teaches , uh , middle school . 
 and they can't , 
 oh , so you're close to the subject . 
by the time they get there , they can't read . 
they can't read anything . 
and yet , you know i have grandchildren , 
i have uh , nine grandchildren in various parts of the country , 
and , of course , you know , i can't speak to the rural or poorer inner city schools , 
these kids go to a f , 
they live in a fairly nice upper scale neighborhood , 
and they seem to be doing extraordinarily well . 
i , i mean i quiz them 
and i talk to them , 
and they read well , 
they do everything well . 
but that's part of the environment . 
i think your children are doing , uh , um  , 
that could be very well true . 
 yeah , she can tell , 
they meet with all of the parents , 
and she can tell before a parent comes in , normally ,
no kidding . 
 oh , i , 
 oh , yeah . 
i guess i can understand that . 
however , i'm a product of the new york city public school system from fifty years ago ,
in the grammar schools and part of high school , 
so i lived in new england at the time , 
i sent all my children to prep school . 
i was f , 
i didn't have that much money 
but we struggled 
and we did it 
 and a great deal of the success that they had in their education was due to the low student teacher ratio . 
i think it's probably very true . 
and , that's a formula that could be applied everywhere ,
let's sit down and read together . 
well , that's , 
i think we both agree on that , 
oh , it's parental . 
and i guess you got to take them away from the tube also . 
another problem i have is , uh , i don't really know how to resolve this , 
but is the , incredible , at least in the high school and college level , emphasis on sports , where enormous amounts of money are spent , 
and it seems to me that well spent somewhere else . 
 but there's been some research , because i'm a , 
oh , yeah . 
in other words , while they're national champions ,
average human beings like you and i , average joes , that make a decent salary , 
but i mean , 
but thousands of people , 
 uh , to , 
you say other things than sports , though . 
because , no , 
 normally it's because of the sports . 
i know , 
but i mean , they don't just send it to the new stadium , 
 but see , the sports brings in the money . 
because when georgetown was number one , 
 well , i guess they're  ,
and now it's down to like , fourteen million . 
during that time period , in other words ,
well , i never thought of that benefit , yeah . 
but the consequence ,
it's amazing the way , 
but now that's big time . 
isn't that something , though , 
i didn't realize that . 
but , uh , smaller schools aren't like that , uh , 
only the big time schools show that . 
but you're right , 
i think the emphasis on sports , 
and as a , 
see , i'm a former athlete in a sense , 
i swam , um , 
but swimming never gets much glory , so it really doesn't matter . 
 well , mark spitz made a lot of money on it . 
that's true , 
but you know they still , 
 and he came back this year , 
didn't he , 
but he didn't make it . 
he didn't make it , 
if he would have , though , 
but i think , uh , realistically you know , you read the , 
and , uh , i don't think he would have made it simply because the research shows that distance running ,
and he was good at distance , spitz , as a swimmer , you know , 
i can remember that , 
but the distance strength and endurance , or whatever , sort of starts to peak at about twentyeight , twentynine , thirty . 
that's why some of your long distance runners ,
and , but he's was trying to make it in the sprinter's event , 
and most of them ,
but i was quite interested in that myself , 
but i read where , the reason that he had to do this in the sprint events is that national television wouldn't pay for the distance events , 
and they didn't think they could capture the excitement to get sponsors ,
oh , you're kidding . 
here he comes down the finish line , 
so it had to be , 
and i guess , capture the whole thing for some sponsor . 
 and that 
as an athlete , i just hate that . 
go head , 
what were you saying ? 
well , uh , college , 
i went to summer school , 
and i thought rather than finish early , i just enjoyed some of the subjects that i was taking 
and i had the ability to go in summer school , 
so what that leads me , 
my next thought is , i understand there's a lot of talk now about extending the school year which seems inordinately short anyway ,
 well , how do you think that would work in grammar schools 
that's right .
 and something you have to consider , too , um , because i know as a , 
 um , where do you work at 
or 
i live in , uh , richardson ,
oh , okay . 
and , uh , 
we're neighbors . 
 uh , but grew up in , uh , iowa on a farm with a considerably different philosophy in terms of lawn and garden 
uh , and uh , 
can you hang on just a minute ? 
thank you .
i have no idea . 
he didn't broadcast . 
thank you . 
i'm sorry . 
go ahead . 
so , uh , .
 oh , i do all the time . 
 and , uh , 
i get a lot of good tips from him . 
i have his book , too . 
don't do uh , 
but , uh , 
not in texas . 
there was one when ,
and we just continued with them for a long time and then switched to a different one , 
but in terms of the fertilizing and , uh , 
what about you ? 
well , no , 
i can do it much cheaper and better . 
and so what i did , i switched to liquid , 
and i do it with an applicator with my hose , 
and it's so much easier than taking that lawn spreader and walking all over 
i was surprised how easy it was . 
well , good . 
so i found , you know , 
and i've got some problems with , uh , two trees in my front yard , 
and i took them to a certified , uh , nurseryman the other day , 
 and do you know what he told me i needed to do ? 
which is , 
it's just unreal . 
he said i needed to pull every leave off the tree , 
and the tree is fifteen feet high , 
and it probably has about ten thousand leaves on it 
and he told me i needed to pull every leaf off and then spray it with this chemical that he said i should purchase . 
this is unreal . 
so , uh , i think i'll get my soninlaw to do that for me , if he will . 
what kind of a , 
is this some sort of a disease , 
or is it a pest ? 
and i don't know ,
and then 
well , one is a maple , 
but i would much prefer , 
i think it's not a native texan tree . 
and , uh , the ones that really do well are the ones that are on the city property , 
and they don't ,
 and they're cedar elm , 
and they're just beautiful . 
so i mean , it's , you know , these things that you pamper , 
some people have really a green thumb , 
you know , 
but , i don't know if it was from the late freezes that were , or the early freezes we had , that caused this tree damage , 
and you know , sperry said , you know , that's what happened to the crepe myrtles ,
so , i kind of think that maybe that , uh , happened to these large trees that i have . 
and i really hate to lose them , 
but , um , that's one of the hazards i guess of , uh , having a yard . 
 because i , 
well , is trees 
 but were there when we moved in ,
and he just put in whatever was cheapest that he could claim was a tree i think . 
the quick growing , 
and he , 
and , uh , figured up last night , 
there were seven different trees of various kinds and sizes in the yard when we moved in , 
and we got one left at this point , 
but , uh , a couple of them weren't too good trees , we've lost to wind , uh , uh . 
 uh , uhhuh 
uh , and then , uh , a year ago we lost , uh , another one . 
 can i pick your brain about how you got rid of those trees ? 
are they still there , 
did you cut them down at the ground level , 
or did you pull them ,
or how did you get rid of them ? 
 because i 
 well , d , 
i don't know how to get rid of these big trees , because one has a circumference of about ten inches , 
we didn't have any that were that , 
the wind blew over 
because i don't want 
now a year ago 
but what i just used a hand saw and sawed them off at , 
the base ? 
to the ground ? 
i see 
uh , a stump killer . 
yeah , 
but , uh , this last one had a fair sized root 
and some guy was doing a job in the neighborhood , uh , 
and saw it and stopped in and asked ,
he had a trailer with a machine on it that was specifically for that , 
 and it 
 and they get that saw , 
and i think it's screwing thing that just rips it right out . 
and it just ripped it 
right out , 
and , uh , i took the , 
he left the chips , 
and i put them up 
used those for , uh , mulch , 
but , uh , 
a blessing in disguise . 
i mean , two fold purpose . 
but , uh , .
well y , 
do you do your own , uh , 
 because i'm sitting on a hill , 
oh , yeah . 
uh , yeah , 
a old push , uh , uh , sears mower . 
it's been fifteen years now , since we first moved to texas , we've had it , 
and i keep waiting for it to die , 
but , every year it just seems to hang on , 
do it myself . 
 well , that's good .
they're very expensive . 
but , uh , yeah , 
 , a year ago i took into , 
we won't even work on it . 
and i took it back home , 
and it's , 
plugs along . 
but , uh , 
they always try to give you a song and dance . 
but , one of my sons and a couple of his friends this year have  , 
do you have lots of credit cards  ? 
but we don't really use them a lot . 
well , we like a lot of gasoline credit cards ,
but as far as like mastercard and visa , we don't use those too often . 
what about you ? 
 um , i used to have a ton of gas credit cards , 
and now i have one or two of them , 
but i think i've even let some of them expire . 
but i was living out of the country for a while 
so i wasn't using them too much 
 and i don't drive that much . 
but i have , you know , mastercard and visa  as you know ,  
i have a mastercard and an american express now . 
i got rid of the visa because it was getting out of hand having fifteen million cards . 
but , as long as , 
like my mastercard is , um , free as long as you spend  about , i don't know  three thousand dollars a year or something like that . 
and so , i tend to buy almost all major purchases on a credit card ,
and , um , i used to even use it for my grocery shopping and stuff . 
the stores around here don't let you do it too much . 
oh , really ? 
and so i don't . 
but i was living in france 
and there you pay for everything by credit card , 
but it's not really a credit card .
oh , is it like an automatic debit 
or s , 
oh , huh . 
and , um , just , you know , many times you get out of the store faster if you pay with that than if you pay with cash . 
 oh , really ? 
um , yeah . 
we use our credit cards sometimes for a big purchase , 
but we always have the money set aside already 
and then we just pay it off the next ,
we don't like to pay interest on the credit cards at all . 
i never pay finance charges on them except when i screw up which i occasionally do . 
and , you know , i'll forget to pay the bill by the due date , 
or this last month i mailed a check to them on the twentysecond 
and they didn't get it until the thirtieth , 
and it was ,
and you know , so i thought i , 
and so i got hit up with a uh , finance charge on it which pissed me off 
but they have no proof of that . 
i  don't want to  probably talk to them some more discuss it , 
but um , usually never pay finance charges . 
we screwed up one time like that too . 
we mailed it 
and they just never did get it , 
and we had to finally mail them another check . 
i had that hassle one time 
and they eventually found the check and deposited it 
 and months later they were still telling me that i owed them finance charges and , um , late fees and things like that . 
and you eventually did deposit it . 
so , you know , i guess i don't know who the burden of proof is on . 
i don't either . 
you know ,  kind of the   , 
because you never d , 
when i pay bills i don't make a xerox copy of it 
or i don't 
you figure ,
or i don't mail them all a signed receipt whatever i ,
and ,  i mean  you can't do that , 
it would be ridiculous . 
i like to use my card if i buy something through the mail which i don't do real often or something from out of state , you know , where if something is wrong ,
well , you can , 
or i don't know what this is . 
so don't charge it , 
well , that's basically what happened with us is we bought a computer , 
and the computer , um , didn't do what these people said it would do . 
 we need to just put  external cards in 
and it wouldn't do that 
so he brought it back to them , 
and they're supposed to modify it . 
we can't use it . 
and then a month later , i had to dispute it in writing , 
and i was out of the country and got back , 
and i took care of it as soon as we got the computer back 
and it was okay . 
i mailed off a check 
but then it was too late . 
so now they're hitting  me up there  with a finance charge . 
but it's sort of , you know , 
it's half our fault . 
and so w , 
if you filed that letter with them then they will kind of , 
if i had filed the letter to dispute it and then paid it eventually , it would have been okay . 
so i learned that for the next time . 
 i'm like you , too ,
uh , i don't like to pay the yearly fee for a card . 
right now both the mastercard and the visa , we don't have to pay a yearly fee on 
now we had american express cards 
and my husband had always had that before we got married , 
and those got so high we finally decided for him and me both to have a card it was like ninety dollars or something i think , 
i can't remember 
but we decided let that one go 
well , my husband and i both have that 
and i don't know what we pay for his card , 
i pay i think , 
i have a gold one 
 and i'm not quite sure what it is for him . 
but i had really like w , 
nowadays i'm not so sure that it's worth it , 
but , um , in the past you know , there are some places that only take american express 
 and then they don't have the credit limit because i've over done the credit limit on the other card , 
if my husband and i both travel ,
and , um , with the american express they say there is no limit . 
there really is 
but they ,
but then that was one advantage 
but that's like , 
i don't , 
i think it's seventyfive dollars for me and forty for him 
be n , 
but , yeah , 
like you said , if you need that extra for charging tickets and stuff ,
because there are some , 
like i think a t and t has one that's free if you make two purchases a year . 
well so , 
that wouldn't be too hard to do .
and so that's easy enough to do , 
and if that's true , um , it might be better off to have that as a second card just to have the credit .
have you ever run into problems of charging up more than you meant to and having to ,
we've never had ,
and i mean , i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it 
but i don't understand . 
because people think it doesn't really cost them anything to pay . 
i have had months where i was shocked at how much had come in because like i thought i would buy a big expense and think that it would take one or two months to process 
 and sometimes it comes in right away 
and it will come in on the next one , 
you have to pay for it right away anyway . 
but sometimes the   is  long  .
like i've had things that i didn't get billed on for two or three months . 
i guess it depends on whoever you buy it from how fast they turn them in or something . 
lot of places have tho , 
i guess they're called those pointed sale terminals where it's like it goes in the minute ,
but , that's what happened with us 
like we bought a washing machine  seven  months ago , 
and i got billed like the next day .
oh , gosh . 
it didn't matter because we couldn't have paid for it by check 
but we prefer g , 
like with the credit card you get the automatic , um , one year guarantee so if something breaks , things like that . 
that's nice . 
you can , uh , return it so like the washing machine we bought it in october 
and , you know , if something goes wrong with it within the first year we've got an automatic guarantee on it besides the manufacturer's guarantee . 
and somethings like that are , 
i like that feature 
and the insur , like if you break it yourself even , you know , 
if you buy something that's breakable . 
or if it gets stolen or if you lose it or whatever it might be 
 and hopefully you never use . 
but like if your bagga , 
but things like if your baggage gets lost , you get money for that 
oh , really ? 
 oh , i didn't know that . 
and yeah , 
when you rent a car , you get that 
and sometimes you get discounts with the cards 
and so  . . . 
well i usually keep up with news by watching a b c news on television and reading the papers here the local dallas morning news 
and then i also take the wall street journal . 
do you get a chance to do it at home 
or do you mostly like catch up while you're at work ? 
do you have a chance to look through the wall street journal ? 
i'm not sure what you do . 
at the office i generally catch the wall street journal at lunchtime . 
i use part of my lunch period to , uh , read the wall street journal . 
 well the , 
then , uh , i read the , the newspaper at home generally in the evening . 
i'd rather sleep the extra thirty minutes in the morning . 
i understand that . 
well and you have a little bit better newspaper . 
the dallas morning news is a good paper . 
lubbock is kind of small 
and the a j s , uh , kind of dominant . 
there's no competition , so what you get is what you get . 
we used to take the paper every day 
and i finally quit taking it because it stacked up . 
i never got around to reading it 
and so i try to take , you know , weekend papers , 
 and then during the week , i catch up , you know , on the radio on the way to work or if i'm traveling around at lunch or on the way home 
and hopefully i'm sitting down by the ten o'clock news to where i can kind of get a recap on t v , uh . 
that's , uh , what we do to , 
we're never in home in time to really watch the six o'clock news on television , 
 so we catch the ten o'clock news , 
 but i catch the news on the radio coming to and from work , 
but radio news is rather short . uh , 
it is . 
most of the stations here that are not all news stations you get about five minutes on the hour . 
and if you catch the news stations , uh , you don't catch that much in the car . 
oh , i see . 
but , uh , 
 i don't know , uh , what do i want to say ? i wish that i was around more news . 
it's frustrating when i don't know what's going on . 
i feel like it's hit and miss 
and i haven't found anything yet that keeps me there on a constant basis . 
and it might be local 
and it might be national 
i have the same situation . 
i tried the news magazines like time , newsweek , u s news and world report , 
 and they'd just stack up . 
i wouldn't find time to read them . 
you have to have time to sit down and concentrate on the stories 
and you wind up throwing them out without reading them . 
that's true . 
because it's too much trouble to try and catch up , 
that's true , 
i guess we're becoming more of a television oriented nation in that i don't think that , uh , my children even read newspapers , other than the t v guide section . 
uh , oh no .
there's is all , uh , strictly television news . 
a little bit that worries me , because i feel like the news is so biased . 
oh , yeah . 
and yes , 
they report facts , 
and yes 
you can get an idea of what's going on , 
but , you know , it's , an , 
and i wish they would just report the incident and then leave the commentaries out . 
it's the same 
just report the facts . 
it's hard to separate the news from the comment , because ,
and so then you have to try and sort out what really is the news . 
and i feel like they sensationalize things that shouldn't be sensationalized . 
i feel like they focus too much on things that , i don't know , you know , 
so much during the gulf war , they would ask questions that , uh , you wouldn't want broadcast . 
that's right . 
 but they keep asking these questions 
and i thought it was really , well i don't know , asinine actually . 
well so many of them also come through 
and they have discovered that this is the most popular issue of the time . whether it be the homeless or , uh , cancer or whatever 
and then they devote , uh , an inordinate amount of time on the news cast to their personal ax to grind . 
 and , uh , uh , 
i agree . 
and they'll take up ten minutes of a newscast and leave out something . 
i'm not saying that's not important , 
 but they leave out a real news issue to devote to one of their local pet projects . 
that's true , 
and it's frustrating . 
so it's probably television or radio . 
i see very little paper 
but , i don't get to see that as much as i want 
and when i do i'm wondering why i wanted to see it so bad .
 yeah , that makes sense . 
we , uh , again , 
like i say , by the time i read the newspaper it's that morning's news from the day before 
and i'm reading it in the evening , 
i'm about a day behind most of the time anyway .
well i'm glad tha , 
it makes me feel like i'm not alone , though , in the world . 
i used to think that i was probably the only one that just , i don't know , was running around so much . 
i look at other , uh , women workers or , men at work ,
i always feel like i'm running a rat race . 
 so , i guess news is just part of that rat race for me . 
my wife and i feel that we never have a moment that we can call our own . 
it's always , there's something going on all the time , uh , 
you don't really have time to sit down and thoroughly read a newspaper . 
as a matter of fact i read the sunday paper this evening . 
we had such a busy day yesterday . 
didn't find time to even read it . 
that's incredible too . 
 well i appreciate talking to you . 
nice talking with you . 
have a good evening . 
same to you .
