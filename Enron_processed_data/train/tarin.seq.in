dave: i was thinking about our conversation yesterday.
"if el paso, absent this power deal, were to give us physical gas for 8 years discounted at their wacc in exchange for an upfront cash payment from ene, is that transaction a mark-to-market gain for us?"
"if not, what's the difference in paying them with an asset rather than cash."
"if it is a mark-to-market gain, isn't this a way to generate false p&l?"
john

"i do know that jody is in a role that has real day-to-day commitments, so if there is not a feasible way to have someone calc a book for him i will understand."

"also, thank you for taking the time to listen to my situation regarding my application and talking to dr. harris for me."
"after meeting with many of the faculty and staff (professors brown, titman, jemison & ronn) at the school, my desire to attend the school is quite strong."
the school is a perfect fit for the career i am trying to pursue in energy and is a institution where i would be able to contribute to and learn from the energy-finance program due to my experiences with enron.
"eventhough i have tested poorly on tests such as the gmat, i feel that the rest of my application is quite strong and that i have proven that i can successfully compete in a competitive environment (ie. enron)."
i excel in environments (team-oriented) such as described by the many people i talked with at the texas b-school.
"again, thanks for taking the time to talk with me about my application and it was good to see someone from boston, who lived in dc and was now living in texas, such as myself."

"(i propose this out of an abundance of caution because in one part of the document brian states the parties have agreed on comprehensive settlement, but later in the document he states that the parties aren't fully committed yet.)  if he will not agree to do this, then i would suggest we leave tw off the list and file a letter with the cpuc along the lines of what i circulated yesterday, with additional language supporting the motion for extension of time."

"one sunny afternoon, out of nowhere, appeared the fairy godmother."
"cinderella said """"fairy godmother, what are you doing here after all these years??"
""""" the fairy godmother replied """"well cinderella, since you have lived a good, wholesome life since we last met, i have decided to grant you 3 wishes."
is there anything for which your heart still yearns?
""""" cinderella was taken aback, overjoyed and after some thoughtful consideration, and almost under her breath she uttered her first wish: """"i wish i was wealthy beyond comprehension."""
""" instantly, her rocking chair was turned into solid gold."
cinderella was stunned.
"bob, her old faithful cat, jumped off her lap and scampered to the edge of the porch, quivering with fear."
"cinderella said """"oh thank you, fairy godmother""""."
"the fairy godmother replied, """"it is the least i can do."
what does your heart want for your second wish?
""""" cinderella looked down at her frail body, and said: """"i wish i was young and full of the beauty of youth again."""
""" at once, her wish having been desired became reality, and her beautiful youthful visage had returned."
cinderella felt stirrings inside her that had been dormant for years and a long forgotten vigor and vitality began to course through her.
"then the fairy godmother again spoke """"you have one more wish, what shall you have?"
""""" cinderella looks over to the frightened cat in the corner and says""""; """"i wish for you to transform bob, my old cat, into a beautiful, and handsome young man""""."
"magically, bob suddenly underwent so fundamental a change in his biological make-up, that when complete he stood before her, a man, so beautiful the like of which she nor the world had ever seen, so fair indeed that birds began to fall from the sky at his feet."
"the fairy godmother again spoke: """"congratulations, cinderella."
"enjoy your new life."""
""" and, with a blazing shock of bright blue electricity, she was gone."
"for a few eerie moments, bob and cinderella looked into each other's eyes, cinderella sat, breathless, gazing at the most stunningly perfect man she had ever seen."
"then bob walked over to cinderella, who sat transfixed in her rocking chair, and held her close in his young muscular arms."

<br>ca merchant storage plant passes major test california regulators thursday released a final environmental impact report for the state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the sacramento valley of northern california.
"absent new opposition from surrounding landowners, texas-based western hub properties hopes to have its $80 million storage project operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the approval process for environmental review."
"western hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project in texas and it has identified a site for a second california storage operation in the bakersfield area, according to jim fossum, western's california operations manager."
"final approval of the lodi gas storage project located south of sacramento should come in may, fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this summer and be operational before the end of the year. """
"""we see the environmental report as the 'light at the end of the tunnel',"""" fossum said."
"under california's environmental review process (ceqa), the california public utilities commission (cpuc) prepared a draft environmental report (eir) identifying the project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures."
the draft then was circulated to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before the final report can be issued.
three public hearings on the draft report were held by the cpuc last october.
"under the cpuc's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative law judge for the case is due by mid-march, after which there is a 30-day period before the project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, a cpuc spokesperson said. """
"""we hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already have our compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and that can go pretty quickly,"""" fossum said. """
"""in the best of all worlds it would be this year; in the worst case, it would be a year from now."""
""" western hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current discussions with others, said fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify the types of customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, power plant operators and other large industrial customers."
"the lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 bcf working capacity, with 400 mmcf/d injection and 500 mmcf/d withdrawal capacities."
it will be connected to pacific gas and electric co.'s backbone transmission system through a 35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 miles of 24-inch-diameter pipe.
"during the past year's delay in start-up, western has """"moved the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot,"""" fossum said. """
"""to make accommodations to nearby farmers."""
""" western hub's similar-sized texas project is south of san antonio and would be connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: houston pipeline, pg&e --- texas (bought recently by el paso) and the city of san antonio. """
"""we expect to have it on-line the same time as lodi,"""" fossum said."
"fossum said western is """"moving ahead"""" with a second california site in the bakersfield area, but he declined to give any further details, noting western hub expects to have more definitive information next month."
"he did say that if a second california project moves ahead, western expects to have it operational by early 2002."
"unlike northern california, storage in the bakersfield area would not have to connect with the local utility transmission system of southern california gas."
"the combined kern river/ mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area."""
dutch: the increase in position and subsequent position limit violation was due to two factors.
"first, a long position was moved into the long-term exotics book due to the nature of the position."
i am currently using the ltx to hold longer-term strategic positions.
the large increase in position is a reflection of my view of the market.
"second, a large customer transaction originated by fred lagrasta's group was transacted at the end of the day monday and was not able to be hedged until this morning."
hence a large position increase occurred for yesterday's position and a corresponding decrease occurred today.

"first of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that used to be it."
it's for lft space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.
a receipt point has now been specified:  bloomfield compressor.
"our tariff allows us to cancel lft up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so sempra negotiated us down to only one day."
tk worked with darrell schoolcraft on this and they determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.
scheduling will happen pursuant to the lft priority set forth in our tariff.
i left a message for you just now;
you are awesome.
thanks.
"chonawee, as i have pointed out, short-selling the stock may be a bad decision because of tax implications (ignoring the legal aspects)."
suppose the strike is $70 and you were granted an atm option.
you  sell short at $70 ten lots (one lot  = 100 shares).
the price goes to $100.
"you lose $30 x 1000 = $30,000 on your short position."
"option exercise gives you $30,000."
this is before taxes.
you pay taxes on your option income (it's treated as ordinary income).
"the tax is 28% x $30,000 = $8,400."
"you can use only $3,000 of your loss against ordinary income."
this saves you only $

"from:  phillip k allen                           09/28/2000 10:56 am liane, as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there may have been an attempt to manipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index."
it appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas.
"at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation."
"additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan."
we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27.
"these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon)."
please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.
we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships.
the two key points from this data are as follows: 1.
"the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days."
2
the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest)  is  consistent between the end of september and october gas daily.
it doesn't make sense to have monthly indices that are dramatically different.
i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
"hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers."
i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.
it is enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.
it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indices against which to conduct our physical and financial business.
please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal.
"sincerely, phillip allen"
i'll let him know by cc.  thanks.

hey there mr. real time.
looks like you did a deal with pacificorp on 11/28 - epmi stca buys 8 mw @ $60 for hour 2.
these eight silly little megawatts have unbalanced our book and driven the schedulers to near insanity.
"no, just kidding."
but i think there should be a sale of 8 mw from nevada to mead on hour 2 somewhere in there.
"i don't know - i'm not the expert, which is why i'm asking you."
will you please let lisa gang or me know how to fix this.
"i'm more than happy to do it, just wanted to double check with the man who created the mess in the first place."
(kidding again.) kate

things have been incredibly busy.
the wedding plans have changed considerably.
"as i'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception."
"we figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger, frustration and stress."
"how's the job, new house, and terri doing?"
have you been to many bears games?

"""we have put together the following list of issues for the request for rehearing of the ferc's november 15 order."
"we would appreciate your input about whether to pursue these issues and we will still have to decide who will write up the various issues (alan, bracewell, wptf, or epsa)."
"requests for rehearing are due on january 14, 2001."
we oppose doing away with the opportunity cost standard under the soft cap and not establishing a standard of reasonable profit $150 cap too low (is there any point in raising this issue again?) benchmarks for forward contracts - the ferc should clarify that it will not be applying this to anything other than cal iou contracts.
"the ferc should clarify its statement that """"to the extent the ious' resources exceed their load at various times, they are free to sell any surplus at wholesale, pursuant to their commission-filed rates schedules."""
"""  a literal interpretation of this sentence will limit liquidity in the market and prohibit the ious from taking advantage of spreads between where their generation and load is located."
we don't care about the ious trading options but we are concerned about less liquidity.
commission's findings concerning exercise of market power (and puc's request for protective order) - this issue is a placeholder pending input from richard sanders and robin gibbs.
"we oppose the 27-month refund period we oppose allowing the state a role in governance (wptf) the ferc should not have rejected dynegy & reliant complaint concerning being paid the cost of cover for exports"""

df<br>ca merchant storage plant passes major test california regulators thursday released a final environmental impact report for the state's second merchant underground natural gas storage project in the sacramento valley of northern california.
"absent new opposition from surrounding landowners, texas-based western hub properties hopes to have its $80 million storage project operating by the end of this year, following a year's delay in the approval process for environmental review."
"western hub is also pursuing a similar-sized underground storage project in texas and it has identified a site for a second california storage operation in the bakersfield area, according to jim fossum, western's california operations manager."
"final approval of the lodi gas storage project located south of sacramento should come in may, fossum said, meaning that construction could begin this summer and be operational before the end of the year. """
"""we see the environmental report as the 'light at the end of the tunnel',"""" fossum said."
"under california's environmental review process (ceqa), the california public utilities commission (cpuc) prepared a draft environmental report (eir) identifying the project's environmental impacts and mitigation measures."
the draft then was circulated to appropriate public agencies and the general public for comment before the final report can be issued.
three public hearings on the draft report were held by the cpuc last october.
"under the cpuc's procedures, a proposed decision from the administrative law judge for the case is due by mid-march, after which there is a 30-day period before the project can come before the five-member commission for a final decision, a cpuc spokesperson said. """
"""we hope to be on-line, and that is 'hope', this year because we already have our compressors and pipe, so it is just a matter of getting crews there and that can go pretty quickly,"""" fossum said. """
"""in the best of all worlds it would be this year; in the worst case, it would be a year from now."""
""" western hub has some of its customers lined up, and it is in current discussions with others, said fossum, declining for competitive reasons to even identify the types of customers, although they are expected to be large shippers, marketers, power plant operators and other large industrial customers."
"the lodi project is designed for full operation as having a 12 bcf working capacity, with 400 mmcf/d injection and 500 mmcf/d withdrawal capacities."
it will be connected to pacific gas and electric co.'s backbone transmission system through a 35-mile pipeline consisting of three miles of 30-inch-diameter and 32 miles of 24-inch-diameter pipe.
"during the past year's delay in start-up, western has """"moved the pipeline around a bit, but not a whole lot,"""" fossum said. """
"""to make accommodations to nearby farmers."""
""" western hub's similar-sized texas project is south of san antonio and would be connected with three natural gas transmission systems in the area: houston pipeline, pg&e --- texas (bought recently by el paso) and the city of san antonio. """
"""we expect to have it on-line the same time as lodi,"""" fossum said."
"fossum said western is """"moving ahead"""" with a second california site in the bakersfield area, but he declined to give any further details, noting western hub expects to have more definitive information next month."
"he did say that if a second california project moves ahead, western expects to have it operational by early 2002."
"unlike northern california, storage in the bakersfield area would not have to connect with the local utility transmission system of southern california gas."
"the combined kern river/ mojave interstate pipeline also comes into the area."""
i'm doing my best to be out by 6.
"""in my never-ending quest to expand myself both culturally and socially i am proposing a fun-filled friday night to those of you who i feel would appreciate it most, or at least have any interest what-so-ever."

"all of the tickets for this show are being sold at a set price, which means that we can obtain center orchestra seats for only $25.00 a piece."
"my idea for the night is as follows, attend what i'm sure will be an outstanding performance, grab a late bite to eat at one of several excellent restaurants downtown (mia bella and osteria d'aldo come to mind) and polish off the evening by gracing one of the many hot-spots found downtown (jones bar, swank lounge, deans, mercury room, etc.) with our presence."
bear in mind that my plan is completely open to suggestions from each and every one of you.
"while i realize such an early show may interfere with some people's plans (workout routines, etc.) i am sure things could be rearranged for one evening."

had lunch with mema on wednesday at treebeards.
"i get the impression that she's gotten the message that you and jim don't exactly want her dropping in for spontaneous visits, so that's good."

"bill and i saw a play at diverse works last night called """"fucking a.""""  it was a take-off on the scarlet letter."

despite the subject matter it was one of the best plays i've seen in a very long time.
diverse works is an art space in the warehouse district directly north of downtown.
"(nancy littlejohn (worthington) has her art gallery nearby.)  they mostly sponsor dance, dramatic and performance art productions."
"a lot of it is really over the top, but i've seen some cool things there."
"one of my friends at work is trying to get me to serve on the board of directors, so i've been hanging out there to see whether i like the people."
"work is driving me nuts, but that's what they pay me for, i guess."

"lorraine, here are a few notes from my review of the val verde contract, and my initial impressions."
let's talk more about how to approach the issue after we meet with ron tomorrow about maop.
"12/31/92 interconnect agreement: sec. 1.3 specifies pressures and states that unless there is an agreement to provide firm compression service tw will accept up to 200,000 on an interruptible basis."
sec. 2 states that the blanco hub maop shall not be exceeded.
sec. 4.2 limits damages (no consequential damages).
the contract also has a fairly standard force majeure clause.
"2/18/93 letter amendment: sec. 3 obligates tw to provide firm compression service in order to accept 200,000 into tw's system (provided mogi has pressure of at least 650 and quantity of at least 140)."
acknowledges that this is an agreement to provide firm compression in accordance with sec. 1.3 of 12/92 agreement.
"9/25/95 letter amendment: increases quantity to be received at the interconnect to 250,000 once the san juan expansion is effective."
"my initial conclusions:  it is pretty clear we have an obligation to accept 250,000 on a firm basis, provided that burlington complies with the pressure requirements."
"probably the only way we can avoid this obligation is if accepting 250,000 would cause us to exceed the hub maop."
in that case we can argue impossibility of performance.
"also, we could avoid the obligation because the summer heat above certain temperatures constitutes force majeure."
this argument is strengthened by the fact that temperatures seem to have gotten hotter over the years.
the fact that we entered into our most recent agreement with burlington in january of this year weakens the credibility of our arguments (they will say we should have known by now).
"burlington might try to argue that we have an absolute obligation to comply with the agreement, even if it means expensive system modifications."
that argument is not a very strong one because the agreement contains no such affirmative obligation and in fact quite clearly describes the facilities that are the subject of the agreement.
i'm going over the park & loan discounts on cng for may.  i need to see the invoice to compare what we were billed to what cng is showing on the discount letter.

"ena is set up as agent for sithe energies, usa, inc on cng transmission."
i believe either kate or robin did a deal with sithe last october.
"ena released capacity to sithe (only 500 dth per day), and acted as billing and nominating agent on this contract."
it was a citygate sale  in new york and we wanted to transfer title at the pool.
i received a call from scott nelson (212-351-0494) with sithe this morning.
he is terminating the agency.
"transwestern transport options:  a technical conference is being scheduled for january 9, 2001."
hello.
please stop by my desk when you get a chance.
"thanks, mike grigsby 3210c x37031"
i will be in la folio.
sorry
thanks ray delainey
the cgas exchange deals i set up for cgas storage end oct 31st.
i'm thinking of changing the process effective 11/1/2000 - 3/31/2001.
ena billed ces (now new power) for the gas delivered to storage.
now ena needs to pay new power for the gas taken out of storage.
"in my example, we would need to recognize the beginning storage balanc e effective 11/1/2000."
take a look - let me know if you have any comments.
friday was so perfect.
it snowed huge snow flakes.
accumulation was just about 1/4 inch.
the temperature was about 35 degrees and it wasn't windy-so it was just a great day to walk the streets and take in all the snow.
it just felt like christmas.
we took a  carriage ride around central park and they dropped us off at tavern on the green for lunch.
met one of my contacts at prebon for lunch and he  paid for it. .
good  thing because we were drinking mimosas at $10.00 a pop.
we saw two great plays-aida and the lion king.
excellent.
"actually, aida may be the best broadway play i have ever seen."
the music was awesome.
lion king had great special effects with all of the costumes.
the people were dressed like animals and it was really cool.
prebon got us tickets for that too-first row-center section-mezz.
level.
in other words-perfect seats.
"on saturday, we mostly shopped during the day.  deb bought herself a new david yurman diamond ring  and red leathe coat."
you can't believe the people that were shopping.
we went to fao schwartz early-9:00 a.m.-and at 3:00 the line was clear around the building to get in.
the large department stores were like that too-hoards of people.
"you could hardly walk down 5th avenue, it was so crowded."
i have never seen so many mink coats in my life.
everyone had one on.
the hotel we stayed at was excellent.
it didn't have the view you did.
nothing will ever match that.
but all three of us stayed in one room and the room was huge and nicely decorated.
all three of us were able to get ready in a span of one hour.
we ate at some good restaurants too.
the first night was this small italian restaurant.
very authentic.
they took good care of us.
the second night was thai-food was excellent.
the third day was french.
yum yum.
we got out of town just in time.
we really lucked out.
i would go back agai n if the right opportunity came up.
"trena, 3:"
yea...can you come by around 5:30?
what do you want for fred taylor -  do you see he is out for the first 2 weeks?
professor titman: thank you for talking with the people in the admissions office.
i wanted to ask you what you think i could do at this point to help the admission's people understand the reason for my gmat score.
i know that this is a poor reflection of what i can actually achieve and i know that i will do well and be successful in the learning environment at ut.
"if i need to, i can provide the admissions office the documents stating the disability."
"if you can let me know what you think i can do, i would appreciate it."
thanks agin!

i regret to report that i just ended a very unproductive phone conversation with mr. hertzberg.
he thanked us for all our cooperation but politely declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.
"however, it sounded to me like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best."
he also sounded interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at ferc (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.
obviously they are very leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their identity.
he said he would discuss it with ed meaders.
"also, he mentioned that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney will be taking over in his absence."
"that could be good, or it could be bad."
maybe lorraine can sweet talk meaders into at least citing us some cases from hertzberg's memo.
"at the very least, i hope he will show it to the kinder morgan lawyers."
"molly, it would be tanya."

"after shawn and i meet (see below), i will briefly summarize for you the roles that all groups will play in the doorstep review process."

dear mr mcconnell thank you for your e-mail of the 20th october.
i apologise for the slow reply but i was travelling when it was received at the gallery.

"i'm not real sure what i'm going to do about it, but i'm sure i'll think of something."
"phil, i shall be in town through the rest of the week."
the ppa auction is going along well i think.
we are leading on sundance b and have been for 3 rounds now.
some weird things are occuring so it is too early to tell what will utimately happen.
the government has said that it will move to the third and final stage of the auction in the morning.
"we would be estatic if people continue to leave us alone on sundance b. currently we are bid  $112,000,000 canadian and a swap price of 33.5 cad."
but again its too early to get our hopes up.
good morning baby girl!

an interesting piece of information from the oil markets.
iraq is trying to extract concessions from the us and threatens to shut down production as of oct 1 (just in time for the us elections).
the source of this info is phil verlaeger (an oil analyst).
he is very good but excessively concerned with iraqi machinations.
he is the source of news (reported by friedman of the new york times in his op-ed columns) about massive iraqi trading in the oil futures markets.
i personally discount this info: the volume and transparency of the oil markets  would not support this type of huge scale operations by saddam's government.
there may be some trading by iraqi officials on the side.

just a quick note about the free agent and bye week replacements for this year.
the free agent draft will be held thursday at 1pm.
"you will have until 1pm to submit your free agent requests to me at mcuilla@enron.com.  you should include who you want, who you want to drop and the amount of points you want to bid."
you can bid 0 points for a free agent however if someone bids 1 point you will lose.
in the case of a tying bid the two teams will have an open bid to determine who gets the player.
everyone will start with 100 points and you more points based on your weekly finish (1 point for highest score and 12 points for lowest score).

there will be approximately 30 enron business controllers present at the meeting.
"all have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following enron entities:  enron north america, enron europe, enron south america, enron global markets, enron industrial markets, enron broadband services and enron energy services."
"attendees will be here from houston, calgary, tokyo, sydney, london and new york (metals business)."
attached for your reference is the agenda.
"there may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group."
i will look at this more while i am here.

per your request.
is the contract supposed to be an off balance sheet contract?
"""southern trails proposed, at an estimated cost of $155,000,000, a pipeline project consisting mostly of 693 miles of crude oil pipeline acquired from arco."
ten percent of the project would be new construction and the remainder would be conversion of the crude oil line to gas service.
the pipeline system would be divided into an east zone and a west zone.
"the east zone, which will begin in the san juan basin and end at the california border, will have 87,500 dth/d of available capacity."
"the west zone, wholly within california, will have 120,000 dth/d. southern trails received certificate authority for the project on july 28,2000."
"an optional certificate application does not require any showing of market need; however, southern trails did hold an open season from sept. to oct. 1998 during which it received 22 bids totalling 810,000 dth/d of demand."
"the order issuing the certificate did not say how much of the capacity had been subscribed, only that southern trails had contracted with its affiliate, questar energy, for 30,000 dth/d of firm capacity in theh east zone for 5 years and one month, and taht firm transportation service agreements of 5 and 10 year terms are """"being negotiated"""" with prospective shippers which, if executed, would subscribe the balance of the capacity in both the east and west zones."
tw is an intervenor in this docket so i have received everything that has been filed.
i have no further information about any further subscription of capacity.
i also have no information regarding any progress that has been made on construction.
"if you need a more detailed summary of the proposal that was filed at ferc, or if you have any other questions, please let me know and i'll see what i can find."
i've got the entire environmental report in my office if we need that for any reason!
""""

"i'm fairly comfortable that i don't know  whether there really is an edgecombe development company, and if so, is it available to use on the virginia power transaction."

so whats the dealio?
wednesday or no?
tino called this morning with a quick report.
"they are still negotiating with doe on a power plant deal, but it looks pretty shaky."
"the size of the plant has grown to 380 mw, for reasons that are unclear to me."
tino has been ordered to develop an exit strategy in case the power plant deal falls apart.
"he says dennis has about $3 mm in the project so far, most of it related to the pipeline right of way."
"the have a binding 20 year agreement with the tribes for the row that calls for a $100,000 minimum monthly payment."
"i'm not sure the entire route is perfected or not or whether the row agreement includes fiber optic rights etc.  the question is whether we are even interested enough to justify a closer look, since the rights dennis has pulled together will probably be available for cents on the dollar."
i told tino i'd give him a call next week to let him know.
"at minimum, i'd suggest we have one of our row guys take a look at whatever they've got and advise us on what its worth."

ou is obviously a very good team.
"but i think more importantly, they are just playing great football."
"they make plays when they need them, and i know it sounds like sour grapes, but frankly, they are also getting lucky."
"when the qb heaves a pass 40 yds downfield off his back foot and it goes for a td week after week, the football gods are smiling on you big time."
"but regardless, you've got to admire stoops and the job he has done."
they have proven for three consecutive games that they can score almost at will against some of the best defenses in the country.
"and as far as the horns are concerned, i still think they are just an above average team."
they have beaten no one of any (and i mean any) significance.
"they were completely outclassed against the one (albeit right now, the best team in the country) good team they have played."
and lost to a bad stanford team.
but the optimist in me says they are winning at home and that may result in a t+

the record on friday showed that 127 employees from energy operations had pledged dollars to the united way campaign.
"large number, but still percentage-wise smaller than we would like."
i sent the message below to all energy operations employees on friday afternoon.
"we'll see in a few days if this helped on contributions. text of e:mail message to energy operations employees: two weeks ago i toured the depelchin center, one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the united way."
i was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.
i had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.
learning about the important programs offered through depelchin and meeting four year-old jessica and ten year-old steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.
enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit organizations.
"hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year."
the united way campaign is the one time each year that enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in houston.
each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by enron.
"if you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing so as soon as possible."
"our united way campaign draws to its conclusion next wednesday, august 23."
i hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.
"there is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all enron employees can make a significant positive impact for houston.  log on to http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card."
thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge.

scott needs to work on the capacity sheet so we can tell how much transport ces actually has.
there should be some big changes in ces's transport numbers for june.

"please, take a look at this article: vince"
"""please take a look at vig's effort to detect price arbitrage behavior on tw using the same method that steve kirk used on northern."
"you'll recall that steve's chart on northern showed an very close correlation between the calculated arb opportunity and the direction and size of the aggregate customer imbalances, by month."
"proving once again that tw is just a little different, that method shows no correlation at all on tw."
i agree with vig's conclusion that we should not use this data in the 637 filing.
i tried one alternative reading of the data to see if i could find a correlation.
steve's method evenly weights the value of arb opportunities that occur early and late in a month.
"please tell me if you agree, marketing folks, but i think a more logical approach would risk-weight the apparent arb opportunites."
"in other words, an apparent opportunity to short tw and sell the gas for a $."
25/mmbtu profit on the 5th of a month is unlikely to generate arb behavior because a trader has no idea on the 5th what the cash out index will be at the end of the month.
"in contrast, an opportunity to make $."
"25 on the 25th of a month, when a trader can calculate pretty closely what the monthly index will be, is basically free money."
"using that logic, i ignored any apparent arb opportunites in the first half of the month."
"i eyeballed the timing and size of the arb opportunites (i.e., there's a $."
70-.
"90 arb opportunity to short tw from the 23d to the end of may, 2000) rather than using steve's mathematical approach."
i still didn't see the kind of correlation i'd expect.
"the correlation is directionally positive in only 4 out of 12 months, and the size of the imbalances doesn't even make sense in the months that correlate on direction."
"i give up, and am removing the arb argument from the daily imbalance section of the draft."
i'll route that separately.

"should we pin them down on an exact location, maybe have them pick two or three and rank them?"

i think that you and allan misunderstood the request from nelson wu.
"if you look at his resume, is already with enron as an associate."
his e:mail to allan sommer seems to indicate that he is interested in a rotation in allan's group.
"normally, i think that associates talk directly with someone in a group in which they may have an interest."
i don't think that hr gets involved in this process.
i am not sure how i got into this loop.
it seems that if allan has an interest in having an associate do a rotation in his group then he should talk with nelson.  --sally enron north america corp.

"with regard to capacity release i think we will have to give the replacement shipper the cash-for-fuel option, because what if we have sold capacity that was created by the releasing shipper's buying fuel from us?"
"if the replacement shipper suddenly starts shipping fuel, that capacity goes away."
(it's sort of like the efbh/resulting forward haul problem).
probably we should require that the cash for fuel election automatically transfer to the replacement shipper.
this would probably have to go into our tariff someplace when we make our ferc filing;

tetco is going to start scheduling lambertville.
lambertvile is in tetco m3 (in new jersey).
this means that anyone flowing gas through lambertville on a secondary basis will probably strart getting curtailed.
lambertville on tetco will be just like linden on transco z6.
the following ldc's/points are downstream of lambertivlle.
e town n jersey pse&g con ed lilco bug belle mead (interconnect with transco) hanover (interconnect with algonquin) leidy is considered upstream of lambertville.
"also, deliveries to algonquin at lambertiville is considered upstream of the constraint."
tetco will not give me any indication as to how much gas may be cut or how much secondary will be allowed to flow through lambertville.
"meredith, when you get a chance, please confirm which points are downstream of lambertiville."
i can forward you what i've done for your review.
i've sent down the draft interconnection agreement we received from vepco for your review.
"if you don't get it tomorrow, let me know."

"call me, lets chat."
"reviewed by mark williams, svp risk management, citizens power the long awaited second edition of managing energy price risk has finally arrived."
it has been four years since the first edition was published.
"during this hiatus, a lot has happened as risk management within the rapidly expanding energy industry has come of age as a respected discipline."
"the second edition is a rich compilation of papers by a surprisingly representative group of industry leaders, practitioners and academics."
the books strength is that it reinforces the fact that risk management principles initially applied to a narrow band of energy commodities can and should be applied across a wide array of energy commodities including electricity.
"as expected the book does a solid job in capturing an international perspective on the various challenges, which are not isolated to any one continent but are global in scope."
"it includes a lengthy introduction that effectively frames risk management progress, advancements and innovations that started in the oil markets in the 1970's and migrated to the natural gas and most recently expanding to the electricity industry."
"managing energy price risk is comprised of 15 chapters, all of which include an introduction, which minimises the disjointedness that you may expect from a book written by a large number of authors."
"other improvements in this second edition include expanded graphics, highlighted panels, detailed appendices and a separate glossary, which provides the reader with additional reference material."
"in particular the chapter on energy options written by michael hampton is a useful primer and provides the reader with a concise explanation of option theory, pricing, basis risk, delta hedging as well as practical guidelines for distinguishing between hedging and pure speculation."
"for the more advanced reader, the chapter on energy exotic options, written by vince kaminski, stinson gibner and krishnarao pinnamaneni is particularly strong as it outlines the challenges associated with the exotics and effectively documents the latest methods used by leading practitioners in pricing such instruments."
"additionally, the chapter on accounting for derivative contracts in the energy environment by three consultants from arthur anderson, is a well written summary which addresses the numerous tax related issues including a timely discussion on the us financial accounting standards board's statement 133 (see eprm october 1999, page 22)."
having this tax information housed in one concise chapter is of great value.
the second edition however is not without flaws.
"in particular, it would have been useful to have more information on the current challenges risk managers are confronted with in the power industry including latest advancements in volatility and correlation estimation techniques."
additional attention could have also been placed on the shortcomings of the current market structure and methods in finding and applying appropriate hedging strategies and instruments.
"in the fledgling power market, this continues to be one of the primary challenges."
"in summary, this second edition of managing energy price risk builds upon the sentinel work laid out in the prior edition and is a valuable reference book for the new recruit or seasoned veteran."
it is a welcome edition to any risk management library.
fyi.
kathy is changing the address to 1400 smith in the final version.

"""here is the quick & dirty."
none of the gallup contracts contain a shipper out if the facilities are not placed in service by a certain date.
"the respective obligations of the parties do not commence until the facilities are """"tested and placed in service."""
"""  we notified our shippers by telephone yesterday that the facilities were in service."
the compressor has since been taken down because of excessive vibration and an unusual whining noise of undetermined origin.
ee&cc does not know how long it will take to correct the problems; they do not have enough information yet to even give an estimate.
"based on our experience with hubbard, it could take months to correct the problem."
"today, we've been able to deliver all nominated gas simply because noms did not exceed our existing capacity."
"nominations are expected to exceed existing capacity this week, in which case we will have to allocate."
"given the uncertainty involved, from a pr standpoint i believe it would be best to tell the customers that because of unforeseen circumstances we are not in service after all, that we apologize for the mistake and will do our best to provide service on a daily or interruptible basis."
"when the compressor is actually tested and really in service, we'll let them know."
the downside:  we get no reservation charge at all.
"(estimated loss: $25,000/month) the upside:  in the long run we probably save face with our customers."
"from a short-term economic standpoint, the better choice appears to be not to revoke our """"in-service"""" announcement."
"when summer weather kicks in, we'll probably have to allocate every day."
"on our ebb we will have to give some reason for the allocation (or if we don't, shippers will demand an explanation anyway)."
shippers' rights to a reservation refund will be triggered.
the downside:  shippers will never trust us again.
"also, we could be subject to fraud or related causes of action for representing the compressor was """"in service"""" when we knew it was not."
"the upside:  on the off chance no one files a lawsuit and wins, we might at least get to keep some of the reservation charges owed us, to the extent deliveries don't fall below 75% of nominated quantities for a period of longer than 75 days in months other than july and august this summer."
"(in july and august, we don't get any reservation charge for amounts not delivered)."
"we just need to keep in mind that normally the pipeline runs full in the summer months, and gallup capacity was sold with that assumption in mind."
"haven't had time to do a formal write-up; if you want me to turn this into a memo for wider distribution, let me know."
"for now, i think it's important to get a decision on one of the above options."

"""tom, i am sending you the information about our new b2b unit."
i have talked yesterday with greg whalley who is heading the new unit about the e-commerce project at wharton and recommended that enron join this program.
i have sent him this morning a copy of the materials you gave me.
the meeting with jeff skilling has been pushed till the 2nd half of july.
i talked to him briefly twice that jeff shankman and i want to discuss with him building a relationship with wharton.
"jeff shankman is, by the way, a great friend of your institution."
"enron's president and chief operating officer is engineering a fundamental strategy shift at the houston energy company, aimed at making it a dominant """"new economy"""" player across various industrial markets."
"the dollars 446m acquisition last month of mg, the uk-based metals trader, is only the first of more than dollars 1bn in estimated new investments the company is targeting."
"it is seeking vehicles on which to build business-to-business (b2b) platforms in sectors such as logistics, chemicals, agricultural products and pulp & paper."
mr skilling wants to take the business model the company developed in natural gas and power and apply it to other wholesale commodity markets.
"he argues the electronic platforms it creates will not only become the principal b2b sites for those sectors, but reshape those industries."
"as an example, he points to enron's new e-commerce platform, enrononline, which has changed the way the company does business with its customers while significantly increasing sales."
"the company - the largest wholesale merchant of natural gas and power - saw wholesale, physical deliveries of natural gas surge 53 per cent in the first quarter."
"critics argue that enron's move away from its familiar energy business into new industries, where the learning curve is steep and the competition entrenched, is risky."
"yet a number of industry analysts point out enron has proved it understands markets and how to manage risks while becoming the largest importer of coal in the uk, the largest trader of gas and power in the us and grabbing an advantage in bandwidth. """
"""it's a prudent strategy, but it's got to be done in an orderly way,"""" says ronald barone, analyst with paine-webber in new york. """
"""what they're doing here is what they've been incredibly successful at doing,"""" he adds, noting that enron posted dollars 1."
"3bn in earnings before interest and taxes (ebit) from its wholesale energy and services business in 1999, up 34 per cent from the previous year."
"earnings from that division accounted for two-thirds of the company's overall income before interest and taxes last year, and mr barone sees the unit's ebit increasing 15-30 per cent annually over several years."
"as with gas and power and now broadband, where enron is standardising contracts and creating a market in bandwidth, it wants to create markets by entering as a physical player and providing merchant, risk management and financial services over the internet. """
"""we will provide electronic commerce, but we will provide liquidity and we will provide settlement, or fulfilment of that contract,"""" mr skilling says. """
"""that is an extremely powerful model."
"if you look at other b2b sites, they don't do that."""
""" mr skilling argues enron's e-commerce platform will triumph over the other, bulletin board-type exchanges, where striking a deal depends on two parties hooking up and working through uncertainties over timing, price, credit and fulfilment."
not everyone shares that view.
"some energy companies, for example, would rather not do business with a competitor."
"bp amoco recently purchased a 3 per cent stake in altra energy technologies, a houston- based, neutral wholesale energy exchange."
"with koch industries and american electric power, it also committed to carry out a fixed volume of transactions on the site to lend it liquidity."
"just as in gas and power and now broadband and metals, enron believes it needs networks of strategic physical assets."
"in acquiring mg, enron got a stable of warehouses, lending it a strong physical position. """
"""it should provide (mg) with a more vibrant, more active physical spot market in more markets in the world,"""" says greg whalley, chief executive officer of enron net works, the new division enron is launching to identify and enter commodity markets."
"he argues that in metals and other markets, enron will deliver better pricing, price risk management services, cross-commodity transactions and flexible transactions for a wider range of customers."
"mr skilling says there are significant rewards for restructuring an industry. """
"""if you can take that platform, and you use the capabilities the bricks bring to the table, e-commerce the industry and change the structure, you're selling for more than a 50 multiple."""

"sounds like a pretty boring operation up there, otherwise i might be tempted to drop by and see the show."
also heard that the knuckleheads from bath got thrown out of court on their antitrust suit.
"shit, all you needed to do all along was get rid of me and things started falling into place!!!"
"best wishes for continued success--and siguaw, stay the hell out of trouble!"

i am going to try and come down this saturday.
you can laugh at me later for building this.
"in the meantime, maybe you can use it."
thanks for note.
mike jordan in uk is coordinating an effort on this.

hopefully everyone will coordinate.

"poetry analysis/ discussion tulips the tulips are too excitable, it is winter here."
"look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in."
"i am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly as the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands."
i am nobody; i have nothing to do with explosions.
i have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses and my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.
they have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.
"stupid pupil, it has to take everything in."
"the nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble, they pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps, doing things with their hands, one just the same as another, so it is impossible to tell how many there are."
"my body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently."
"they bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep now i have lost myself i am sick of baggage my patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox, my husband and child smiling out of the family photo; their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks."
"i have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat stubbornly hanging on to my name and address."
they have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.
"scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley i watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books sink out of sight, and the water went over my head."
"i am a nun now, i have never been so pure."
"i didn't want any flowers, i only wanted to lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty."
"how free it is, you have no idea how free - the peacefulness is so big it dazes you, and it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets."
"it is what the dead close on, finally; i imagine them shutting their mouths on it, like a communion tablet."
"the tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me."
"even through the gift paper i could hear them breathe lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby."
"their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds."
"they are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color, a dozen red lead sinkers round my neck."
"nobody watched me before, now i am watched."
"the tulips turn to me, and the window behind me where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins, and i see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips, and i have no face, i have wanted to efface myself the vivid tulips eat my oxygen."
"before they came the air was calm enough, coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss."
then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.
now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.
"they concentrate my attention, that was happy playing and resting without committing itself."
"the walls, also, seem to be warming themselves."
"the tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals; they are opening like the mouth of some great african cat, and i am aware of my heart: it opens and closes its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me."
"the water i taste is warm and salt, like the sea, and comes from a country far away as health."

"""brian, thanks."
the changes to the on & off-shore contracts are ok.
"i have replied to an e-mail from kay concerning the """"letter agreement"""", of earlier today."
"as far as i am concerned, we are ready to go there (you were copied)."
kay indicated that the consolidation agreement would be today's focus of attention.
i have not seen any feedback pursuant to my 1/jun/00 e-mail.
"<<enron monterrey/vitro>> your comment about the parent company guaranty reminds me that the above e-mail also called for such a guaranty from enron, as enron na is no longer the purchaser."
*   the consolidation agreement.
*   in 1.
"b, thanks for reflecting the ge suggestion."
"however, near the end of the paragraph, the word """"remedy"""" should move to immediately after """"exclusive""""."
"*   in 8, the reference should be to paragraph 10."
"a, not 11."
a. *   in 10.
"a, it does not look like the wording in my 30/may/00 e-mail was picked up."
"*   in 12 and 13, enron has added new wording since the preceding issuance of this document."
"*   in 13, is all of this wording necessary and applicable."
"at the end of the first long sentence, the word """"turnkey"""" is used."
"of course, this is an equipment supply contract for ge."
"also, i believe the contracts do state what is in ge scope via clauses 1.27, 1.86 and 3.1."
"so, the last sentence is redundant."
"*   more importantly, these two clauses could be interpreted as establishing a geps/geioc consortium."
this is something ge had advocated as the approach in as single contract for tax purposes in mexico.
"ge can still go either way, although the single document approach is more straightforward (and that is what we initialed in your offices last month)."
enron wanted split contracts.
these clauses may undo what enron was attempting to achieve in this regard.
"*   in 14, which has been added by enron in the latest version of the consolidation agreement, the ge entities seem to be prevented from getting an extension of time under one contract if there is a problem with performance under the other."
"this is contrary to the words in the former enron clause 5, which has now been eliminated."
this clause 14 should be removed.
"*   regarding the """"swap"""" payments for tax purposes, to benefit both enron and ge: *   the amount paid to date on the monterrey unit, under the mou, is $25,101,733."
what ge proposes it to: *   revise the payment schedule for the contracts such that payments totaling this amount are due 2-3 days after contract signing.
"*   execute a separate letter, to be signed at the same time as the contracts, formally dissolving the mou."
the letter would call for ge to refund this same amount 2-3 days after receipt of the payment under the contracts.
"we need to draft this letter, which will hopefully be one page."
"the text of such a letter could include the following wording: """"pursuant to clause 30.3 of the now executed on and off shore contracts for this project, the mou dated ______ is made null and void."
"once the initial payment(s) called for in said contracts have been made, the monies in the amount of $25,101,733.00, which were paid under the mou will be refunded to (enron entity)."
""""" *   this would get the monies to the appropriate enron and ge entities."
"in a related matter, since the legal enron entity has changed, ge requests a parent guarantee (using form already shown in the contract(s))."
"regards, jeff smith<br>from:   brian d barto [mailto:brian.d.barto@enron.com] sent:   wednesday, may 31, 2000 11:01 am to:   jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com; kay mann subject:   consolidation agreement << file: mac word 3.0 >> kay and jeff: please review and comment."
kay's comments are included and do not look unreasonable.

"""ken, i have taken a look at the material you had sent me on the arc northern gas pipeline route."
"ultimately, i believe that arc is looking for certain strategic investors to provide founding capital to fund the development of this proposal."
"to the extent that this is a open access non-discriminatory pipe, ena's opportunity lies in being a shipper to capitalize on basis markets or customer transactions that provide attractive risk reward characteristics."
"other than understanding the potential flows and costs, there is probably not much we need to do today given a 2006 start from an ena point of view."
the arc consortium needs to fund approximately $30m to develop this project.
the us and canadian aboriginal groups will receive 33% ownership for $10m.
"the remaining $20m and 67% will be funded by a group of producers, pipelines, venture capital and the """"organizing group"""" (40%!!)."
"stan horton, if he believes this is a commercial possibility, may want to provide a few million of founding capital to the venture in order to preserve him the option to participate as an equity holder or operator if this becomes a reality."

"greg, i've been working with an it guy here who has been building a spreadsheet for some of us that can receive live prices from eol."
"i've used this to build a real-time matrix which shows spread relationships between different gas locations, including variable cost analysis, npv, etc.  i think that this would be an extremely useful application to include on the eol site, whether it is in excel format or some homemade format."
"for example, hunter and i were in chicago last week talking to nicor about analyzing the risk components of their pbr."
"we brought up this idea and they were excited about being able to more clearly see daily cash spreads, hedge mtd and bom pbr price with gas daily swaps, storage utilization logic, etc. if we can develop an eol - dependent application that is helpful to our customers in terms of how they make trading decisions, it will reinforce the importance of using our site over our competitors."
let me know what you think!

"i have in mind a contract that eecc and nepco will agree is the ena form contract, so that there isn't a need to come up with two different contract forms."

james eckert with tenn has agreed to have lunch with us on wednesday.
i don't think we all need to go and i don't need to go either.
he is going to educate us on the vng contract #47.
the demand charge and commodity is discounted effective 11/1/2000.
"this is what we know about the contract: mdq = 16,373 eff 11/1/2000 the 1st 4723/day that we flow is at a discounted  commodity of $."
05 and discounted demand of $6.08 if we flow more than 4723/day the demand goes to $7.61 what i need to know is exactly how the demand charge will be calculated for volumes over 4723 day.
"what is the demand charge if we flow 6000/day  for november - is it 141,690 (4723 x 30) @ $6.08 and 38,310 ([6000-4723] x 30) @ $7.61."

"hey, i glance at that photo every now and then and all i can say is huba huba!!"
"in an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the ppa)."
"it is scheduled for thursday, august 24th, at 900am."
"we are still in the process of locating a conference room, so the location is tbd."
"thanks, kay here are the most recent comments from vepco: some of you may have received this already."
i have not compared it against what we last sent them.
"ken, i would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of john griebling's organization and the research group."
"date:   april 27 - april 29 location:  breckenridge, colorado as you know, john griebling is managing the network design and construction project currently under way in ebs."
the research group is actively involved in this effort which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic optimization and stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting internet traffic flows).
"the objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish transfer of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project in the future."
we are inviting joe hirko and kevin hannon to this meeting.
"we would appreciate if you could speak, together with joe and kevin, on strategic directions of ebs."
"it is important for a group of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to understand the big picture."
i am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.

"if i show, it will be only to lend support to those with real input, and to show legal department solidarity (ie, avoid later lawyer shopping)."
thanks for the info.
kay
call or e:mail - either one is great.
i do hope that you are working with james directly on these issues as they surface.
it is still not clear to me whether or not you two have spent time together on these issues.
i will always support whatever changes can be made to our processes or controls that will insure better information.
"because i can't personally do all of the work, i just want to be sure that you are plugged in to work directly with the right management team members on my team."
i don't think that we are purposefully doing duplicate work.
i believe that the manual process that moves information from the entelligence team to gcp has apparently not worked as well as was designed.
"while sorry that the results haven't been as expected, we are glad to have your input now to help address this."
james has reassigned the resources from entelligence for now to work with mary gosnell on updates to gcp that i understand have been prioritized with you.
what room?
pl
i never got the email.
please send it again.
i will not be attanding this meeting as i understand you both will be.
i'm sure we have many other specific concerns (and i am reviewing the amended supplemental compliance filing as i'm sure you are).
"however, i think our key concern is returning to a stakeholder process."
"since the utilities first filing, we haven't been allowed to be at the table."
this violates order no. 2000.

"the newly reclassified gathering lines include: d-2149, h-19921, ln-943, h-124 and h-21777 south of bradley compressor station."
"on march 22, 2000, cngt filed new tariff sheets to implement the reclassification effective april 1, 2000."
"although the ferc has not yet granted approval of the tariff sheets, cngt is notifying producers that upon approval of the new tariff sheets, cngt will begin charging a gathering rate of $0.198/dt. and a fuel retention of 2.28% for all gas moved on the lines listed above."
"if you have questions regarding this notice, please contact nancy aucremanne at (304) 623-8698 or celesta miracle at (304) 623-8262."
"april 3, 2000                                                received 4/3/00 11:10 am posted 4/3/00 11:10 am dear pool operator: cng transmission corporation (cngt) plans to take its hastings extraction plant (h.e.p.) out of service to perform annual maintenance starting at 12:01 a.m. on tuesday, september 12, 2000."
"this requires that the """"wet gas"""" system behind the h.e.p. in west virginia be shut in."
the plant shutdown will last approximately twenty-one (21) days if no unexpected problems arise during the shutdown.
"normal plant operations are scheduled to resume on tuesday, october 3, 2000."
all questions concerning the shut in and the subsequent turn in should be directed to cngt's local operations supervisor in the production area.
"unless other arrangements have been made to move gas to markets other than on cngt, all wet gas production must be shut in by 5:00 p.m. on monday, september 11, 2000."
this will allow our compressor stations to pull down the field pressure prior to going completely down at midnight and will ensure that we maintain the time-lines on our schedule.
"as per cngt's tariff, failure to shut in by 5:00 p.m. will result in cngt considering the gas to be unauthorized and it will not be credited as a delivery to your pool."
"as the exact time the plant will resume service is very difficult to determine, and in an effort to minimize confusion, producers in your pool will need to coordinate the turn in of their production with cngt's local operations supervisor."
we are also asking that all pool operators notify producers in their pool of this shut in.
cngt will not notify producers individually.
we appreciate your cooperation and assistance on this.
i also wanted to you to know that we are attempting to complete all work necessary for us to avoid shutting down the plant next year.
the next regularly scheduled shut       down will not be until 2002.

"rick, while in tokyo, sanjay grabbed jeff and me regarding redoing and re-looking at the existing lng fuel deals for dabhol."
"the bottom line is that he believes that the government may have issues on actually performing post phase 2 and if we could redo the lng contracts and allow more flexibility we could help them, thus help ourselves."
we need to look into this and i would like your initial opinion.
this is complex to say the least and it would involve using the ship differently than scheduled and diverting some of the oman lng to other markets with their approval.
he believes that there is some flexibility in the shipping and oman contracts to address these issues.
if it works we could create a long physical condition and an extra ship for transport.
is there an opportunity here if all the cards fall into place?
lets discuss when i am in dubai.
sanjay is not going to let it go so you need to think about who can look into this further.

this transaction involves 5 contracts.
nat fuel is billing ena a total of ($.
"125 x 1,000,000 dth) or $"
i heard from algon yesterday on those contracts i said not to pay.
we made a mistake releasing the capacity so ena will be responsible for the charges.
i do not want to bill ces for these charges since we made the mistake.
"this should only be a problem for may and june, i think."
please pay the disputed amounts.
"ben, here's a draft of an mou for the sale of the lms and abb equipment to esa."
one issue is when this transaction can close.
"since the equipment is owned by westlb and since the feeling is we don't want to involve westlb in the transaction, the actual transfer would take place at the termination of the westlb facility."
"if another approach is preferred, we will need to circle back with lisa."
"a second issue i see is with the concept that ge will need to look to both ena (or westlb's successor) for some of the payments, but look to esa for payment for changes, storage, etc.  as far as i know, this concept hasn't been addressed with ge."
"i re-calculated the overhead charge, so you might want to check it out."

"""as you know, we recently did an east-to-east deal with usgt for 400,000 mmbtu/day with alternate rights to california at a higher rate."
socal filed a protest and i'm working on the response.
"in part, they are alleging that tw is """"attempting to exploit a weakness"""" in the gisb procedures to the detriment of existing customers."
"for example, under tw's tariff (which they concede is gisb compliant), primary firm cannot bump alt. firm in cycle 2."
"socal says this means that any primary shipper attempting to deliever to an in-path alt. point will be unable to re-nominate to its primary point once this """"alternate"""" capacity [i assume they mean usgt's] is confirmed."
"according to socal this will substantially limit shippers' flexibility, including the ability to use market area pooling."
once gas is nominated thru a pool its subsequent movement to a delivery point is defined as an al. delivery regardless of the rights of the capacity under which it moves.
"thus by manipulating the gisb cycle process, tw and usgt will bump firm shippers."
i could really use your help in responding to this argument.
"(first of all, i'm not sure i even understand it!)  if either of you have a few minutes today or tomorrow when we could get together, that would be great."
"also -- you two were the first to come to mind, but feel free to refer me to someone else in your group if you are swamped."
please e-mail or call when you get a chance... thanks!

the deal number in sitara was changed because of an internal book name change.
it had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.

"fpl, entergy merge in $7 billion deal new york (reuters) - fpl group inc."
", the parent of florida power & light co., said on monday it would merge with entergy corp. in a stock deal worth $7 billion to create the largest u.s. power generating company."
"the combined company would have a total enterprise value of more than $27 billion, consisting of $16.4 billion in equity market capitalization and $10.7 billion in debt and preferred stock, the companies said."
the merger is expected to immediately boost earnings for both companies.
"under the terms of the agreement, fpl shareholders would receive one share of a new holding company for each fpl share held."
entergy shareholders would get 0.585 of a share of the new holding company for each entergy share.
"based on the companies' closing stock prices, the deal would value entergy at its market value of $7 billion, or about $30.89 per share."
"fpl shares closed friday at 52-13/16, off a year high of 56-5/8 but up from a low of 36-3/8."
"entergy stock ended at 30-5/16, off a high of 31-3/16 but up from a low of 15-15/16."
shareholders' approval required the combination must be cleared by shareholders as well as federal regulators.
fpl and entergy said they hope to complete the transaction within 15 months.
"``the merger combines two strategically aligned, financially healthy companies into an organization that has no equal in the industry,'' said j. wayne leonard, entergy chief executive."
"leonard will serve as president and chief executive of the combined company while fpl's chief executive, james broadhead, will serve as chairman."
"the deal was billed as a merger of equals but gives fpl shareholders 57 percent of the combined company and eight of 15 seats on the board of directors, the companies said."
"once combined, the new company is expected to see annual cost savings of $110 million to $150 million in its regulated businesses derived from eliminating duplicate corporate and administrative positions and programs."
"competitive businesses should see annual cost savings and revenue enhancements of $40 million to $125 million and capital expenditure savings of $50 million to $100 million, the companies said."
fpl and entergy said they will seek to ``minimize workforce effects of the merger'' through a variety of unidentified efforts.
"in addition, both fpl and entergy have authorized stock buyback plans, together worth $1 billion."
"fpl plans to repurchase $570 million shares while entergy is looking to buy back $430 million in stock, the companies said."
i will go through it with ben and show him how to track the deals and update the deal sheet on a weekly basis.
"shawn, just a little buried - why don't you come by on monday."

i scheduled this meeting in houston to best accomodate schedules of some of our enron speakers -- the hill country or even galveston was going to make it impossible for jeff skilling to join us.
i would look at this meeting as if it were to be held outside of town.

"if you can stay at the hotel, this team building will probably be enhanced."
"this memo is not to force you to pack your bags and stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did include rooms for all of you for sunday and monday nights."
"i hate the sunday thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules."
please let patti know on thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to make it easier for you to fully participate.
"yes, i'll see you there!"

"""04:09:26 pm<br>titan land development co., l.l.c.  holds the options on the  3 properties in livingston county."
if  you were to acquire those properties and develop the facility it is my understanding that titan would be the entity that would be the owner of the property and the facility.
"the proposed conditions were drafted to apply to the party defined as the """"owner"""" and not specifically to titan or ena."
"proposed condition no. 12 provides that: the special use approved by this ordinance and all of the conditions, obligations and rights provided for herein shall run with the ownership of the land and the facility."
"for purposes of this special use, """"owner"""" shall include the owner of the property and the owner and/or operator of the facility."
"therefore, the conditions of the special use, including the obligation to make the escrow payment, should not apply to titan until acquisition of the property or development of the facility."
"in the unlikely scenario that titan was to acquire the property but not develop it, failure to satisfy the conditions should only relate to the right to use the property for the facility."
i am working with the county to get a copy of the final ordinance or resolution (they have not completed it yet) to confirm that it is consistent with this proposal.
please let me know if i should pursue the balance sheet treatment with your tax department.
if you have any questions or i can be of any further assistance please let me know.

"""sorry if i'm a little late in the day."
i feel into marathon meeting mode today.
here are my observations of the ge contract.
i tried to confine it to significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.
general terms and conditions i don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for performance/warranty issues.
"final payment is made at shipment, with the buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond expires at provisional acceptance."
there is no financial leverage for final acceptance or the warranty period.
"also, usually provisional or final acceptance requires that ge provide the operating manuals."
the assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.

"it can help to have language which allows for free assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs first."
"also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty."
"again, i don't know the deal so this may be fine as is."
"the contract incorporates ge's proposal as a  part of the contract, but does not give an order of precedence."
"i haven't seen the proposal or any other technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving."
"therefore, you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit."
warranty.
"the language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of the 1st and 2nd paragraph."
"also, the """"outs"""" they have are very broad."
"it is better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry practice)."
"also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a warranty claim."
a statement that they must provide a service engineer within 3 days or so might help.
"i also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty problems need to be explicit."

"horoscope:     weekly   -    his for september 25-october 1: instead of wishing things were different, or woefully mourning the past, build a new beginning."
it's pointless to bemoan recent changes or languish over disappointments.
you cannot change the past.
"you cannot change people's minds, either."
face your situation and create something wonderful.
"the longer you fuss about what 'should have been', the more likely it is that important opportunities will drift by unnoticed."
"cancer, it is time for change."
release frustrations and troubling memories.
"move on, crab. . . move on."
"mine for today quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding once you've released toxic feelings, the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your pleasure."
you're able to replace fear and resentment with compassion and understanding.
"once you know the score, you no longer feel threatened or disrespected."
keep revenge out of this entire episode.
'teaching someone a lesson' is not appropriate.

"liane, as we discussed yesterday, i am concerned there has been an attempt to manipulate the  el paso san juan monthly index."
a single buyer entered the marketplace on both september 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for san juan gas with the intent to distort the index.
"at the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation."
"additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for san juan."
we have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from september 25 to september 27.
"these are the complete list of trades from enron online (eol), enron's direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (amerex, apb, and prebon)."
please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary.
we have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of san juan based on several spread relationships.
the two key points from this data are as follows: 1.
"the high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days."
2
the spread relationship between san juan and other points (socal & northwest)  is  consistent between the end of september and october gas daily.
it doesn't make sense to have monthly indeces that are dramatically different.
i understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.
"hopefully, the trades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to determine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70's and these trades are outliers."
i wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in establishing a reasonable index.
it is enron's belief that the trades at $4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the calculation of index.
it is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to conduct our physical and financial business.
please contact me anytime i can assist you towards this goal.

"no, i haven't spoken with ted since my return...but, i did go out a few of the nights i was in london with an undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course)."
"surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for ted as dating material either."
in summary he found ted to lack attentiveness to his partners and maybe even fidelity.
"he said the break up of ted's marriage wasn't """"all his fault"""", which is a decidedly different slant than the one ted gave me the night of our chat."
i also heard that he has worked his way around enron a bit.
all in all very disheartening information.

"""thanks for the email."
your candid comments make me wish i was over there right now sitting in a pub with you and katy drinking a pint.
"i am in full agreement that guys suck and have discovered through this situation an area in which 23 does not differ from 31...cowardess (as my dad so eloquently put it, """"he's just chicken-shit"""")."
"so, the plan of attack for the time being is none."
"i am not going to do anything (that means no emails, no phone calls, no nothing)."
"of course it's a lot easier to say that knowing he's in an entirely different state vs. two floors down from me, so next week will be the true test."
"you will be happy to know, however, that i do have a good support system in monique."
"she is a firm advocate of the """"drop him and make him work should he happen to come crawling back"""" school."
"you know what really kills me though is the thought that, yet again, i will ultimately be disappointed by someone i truly expected more out of (i keep thinking about all the times i said """"i'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop."""
""" - well, it dropped) ."
"anyway, i've have decided to throw myself into work, books, exercise, etc. in a effort to distract my mind from other things - it's kind of working."
i'm really glad you are in enjoying things so much right now.
"you have to email me back with more details regarding the new pad, like will there be enough room for me to crash there when i come to visit (if not, i'm sure nick would put me up - scarey)."
"also, i sent katy an email about coming to visit so hopefully we can get everything squared away soon."
"fyi:  the longhorns beat louisiana lafayette 52-10 last saturday (the game was fun, but extremely hot!!!), it was a real nail biter."
"talk to you soon, sue *** don't worry about me thinking any of this is in any way due to a shortcoming on my part."
i don't.
"rather, i am convinced he wasn't expecting the full package when we first went out and as soon as he realized that i was, he freaked."
i'm beginning to think it's more than just a coincidence that the last time we went out i let down one of the last walls i was holding up as far as trusting him and it was right after that that he started acting aloof.

"you are all just envious of the relationships that i have develped with the other fantasy owners, that enable me to help improve both teams through trade :"
"""tony, i thought there would be a case that stated that if an interstate pipeline posts the criteria under which it will evaluate capacity bids, it must stick to those criteria and not award the capacity to a bidder on some other basis."
it seems a simple enough extension of the principle that capacity must be awarded on a nondiscriminatory basis.
"however, i did not find any case that stands for that exact proposition."
"as you may be aware, the commission made natural gas pipeline company of america (ngpl) come up with a way to ensure that it awarded capacity one a nondiscriminatory basis...because ngpl was found to have been giving preferential treatment to its shippers."
"ngpl's solution was to come up with an auction process, and there is a whole line of cases if you're interested."
"the underlying presumption is that if you set up a system under which all capacity is awarded and stick with that system, there is no way you could be acting discriminatorily."
but of course the commission never comes out and says this even though it should be obvious.
probably the best we can do is extrapolate from 1) the tariff and 2) the nga (doesn't it also say we have to provide service on a not unduly discrim.
basis?).
"also, in your memo i'd give an example; i.e., if we notify shippers of our auction process and set a deadline for bidding, but then award the capacity to sempra (assuming sempra requested capacity after the posting), we will have unduly discriminated against all the other shippers who had to participate in the auction process."
maybe in future postings on enrononline we should include a statement to the effect that the capacity posted will not be awarded except thru the enrononline process.
now for some trivia.
remember we were discussing with shelley whether we could post a different method (other than that prescribed in the tariff) for determining best bid?
in my westlaw search i ran across the relevant case.
"in northwest pipeline, 85 ferc p 61,335, the commission stated:  """"the commission has previously given pipelines the leeway, in open season provisions, to either include in their tariff a single non-discriminatory bid evaluation methodology, or provide themselves the flexibility of choosing different non-discriminatory bid evaulation methods for different transactions, provided that the pipeline posts the bid evaluation methodology before the bidding process begins."""
"""  the only problem is i am not sure we have that """"flexibility"""" since the tariff does not expressly allow us to post a different method."
maybe next time we do a tariff cleanup we could add some language allowing us to do so.
"i have to move on to my next project but if you want me to comment on what you write i'd be happy to."""
you are giving me 6.6% of the underlying days and i will pay 10% of the underlying price to get the optionality.
come talk to me sometime after 4:00

charlie: it was a pleasure meeting you yesterday afternoon at the columbia business school information session.
"as you probably noticed through my enthusiasm, i really enjoy working in the energy-finance industry, especially with enron."
"working in this sector, at this time, has created many new opportunities."
i am interested in talking with you to see if we can do some type of transaction with you guys.
it sounds like you have a lot going in areas that we might be interested in.
"if you could send me a business proposal or summary of what your doing, that would be helpful."
"with regards to columbia business school, i applied last year and did not get in due to my gmat score."
"i decided to take a graduate level finance class this summer, which i received an a.  i am currently taking another graduate finance class this semester."
"i am also retaking the gmat, with the hopes of increasing my quantitative score."
"last year, i was asked back for an interview, which i felt was a good sign."
i heard from one of my recommenders that the only thing that i needed to improve on was my gmat score.
"recently, i wrote a brief letter to the dean of admissions, linda meehan, informing her of my recent actions as well as my continued interest with columbia."
i hope that these actions will help me get into columbia this year.
"my desire to go to columbia, stems from their network, location, reputation and curriculum."
"since growing up in pelham, it would be nice to get back to new york for a little while."
"as you can see, my desire to go to columbia is very strong."
i hope this brief e-mail has provided some insight into what i'm doing to get into columbia.
i hope we can meet for lunch sometime soon either up in the woodlands or downtown.
"again, thank you for your interest and i look forward to talking with you about columbia and future energy transactions."

"jeff, you will be receiving a dash from the principal investing group which does not fit well into some of the charter criteria; however, i do think this is a venture we should support."
"in a nutshell, it is providing $10mm, in seed capital, to be used in the start up of a new distributed generation company having the primary mission of designing, fabricating and marketing 2mw to 22mw mobile turbine-generator sets."
these units are fully mobile via the nations highways and can meet single digit nox requirements given current scr technology.
"they are primarily utilized for back-up power, emergency power, var creation and peaker application and are fully dual fuel capable."
the ultimate vision is a fleet of mobile/flexible/low cost generator sets that can be put in place very quickly in the most stringent emissions and constrained electrical regions and relocated when market conditions change.
"if ena through this venture can make this technology work, it could be a very powerful tool in our network used to capture opportunity and manage risk; d) low risk - it is expected that roughly 50% of the initial seed capital would be recoverable through asset sales if for some reason the technology did not work or the market did not materialize; e) low tech - this solution utilizes existing turbine/scr technology; and f) ena would have a controlling position in this new venture."
"however, this venture is different than active power and several other principal investing investments in that a) it is a very early stage company and b) ena will have to provide or procure a complete management team if the technology proves out."
"given, that we could benefit most from the successful application of this venture, it is worth the initial work."
"our partner is power systems manufacturing of boca raton, florida."
we have a very solid history with this company.
they have successfully solved many of the technical issues surrounding the korean 6b's which are currently operating at new albany.
they would bring the technical and engineering expertise at cost for their 50%.
ena would ultimately have a buy-out clause at a fixed number for their 50% .
if you would like to discuss in greater detail do not hesitate to call and i will set up a meeting.

"""houston (dow jones)--in the latest update of enron corp.'s (ene, news, msgs) bandwidth trading activities, the company's chairman said tuesday that it has completed about 90 trades of telecommunications bandwidth."
"speaking at the dain rauscher energy 2000 conference, enron chairman ken lay talked about the current status and futures plans the company has for bandwidth trading and broadband services."
"asked what kind of company enron is, lay gave an answer that shows the recent expansion of the company's business strategy beyond energy."
"enron is still basically """"an energy and broadband company,"""" he said."
"while energy is still the source of most of enron's revenue, lay's answer underlines the growth potential it sees in broadband services and bandwidth trading."
"a number of enron officials have been quoted in the last year as saying that, in a few years, it could be making as much money from those areas as it now makes from its lucrative natural gas and power businesses."
"enron plans to spend $600 million-$650 million this year and about the same amount over the next two to three years on broadband and bandwidth trading, lay said."
it will spend more during that time if necessary.
"in fact, the company is planning to sell energy assets around the world in emerging markets that aren't growing quickly enough to meet enron's standards."
"proceeds will be deployed into businesses like broadband and bandwidth trading, which are growing more quickly, he said."
"in pioneering bandwidth trading as a commodity, enron's 90 bandwidth deals put it far ahead of competitors in that nascent market area."
"el paso energy corp. (epg, news, msgs) officials have said they have done 5-10 bandwidth trades this year."
"companies like williams communications group (wcg, news, msgs) won't talk about the number of bandwidth trades they have made."
bandwidth is the capacity to move data between two points on a telecommunications network.
"enron will finish deploying its domestic telecommunications network by the end of this year, lay said."
"some of the fiber-optic network will be lit, or made operational, this year with the rest to be lit later."
"the company has four bandwidth trading pooling points completed in new york, los angeles, las vegas and london."
enron's current plans call for a total of 13 pooling points.
"bandwidth trading pooling points are facilities where telecom carriers can connect to each other to allow data to flow from one carrier to another, facilitating bandwidth trading."
enron plans to begin delivering movies to home via broadband connections in december as part of its deal with blockbuster video and a number of telecom carriers.
"the deal is a 20-year exclusive, worldwide deal with a potential contract value of more than $1 billion to enron, according to materials the company handed out at the conference."

there is nothing attached.
this is the power of prayer at work.
"just send this to (7) people and see what happens on the seventh day. do not break this, please."
"there is no cost, but lots of rewards."
let's continue to pray for one another.
prayer:: may today there be peace within you.
may you trust god that you are exactly where you are meant to be.
may you not forget the infinite possibilities that are born of faith.
"may you use those gifts that you have received, and pass on the love that has been given to you."
may you be content knowing that you are a child of god.
"let his presence settle into your bones, and allow your soul the freedom to sing, dance, and to bask in the sun."
"it is there for each and every one of you amen send this to (7) or more people and witness the awesome power of prayer."""

"the itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when i can do things like that to make your job go more smoothly."
i know the market got chaotic late yesterday; so i probably could have assumed that our net position would be off today and at least one other person would know that.
"but it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line."

"i think that it is a great idea to get some press regarding our fundamental operating standards, but i wonder about the most appropriate timing, enough of a global message and the means of delivery."
"on the means of delivery, i am not sure from your note whether or not i fully understand the intent."
"is there an article to be included in an enron publication and in addition a letter to be sent under john's name (if so, to whom will the letter be sent)?"
or is the letter from john an introduction to be included as a lead in to the article?
"with regard to a global message, i think that one of the key points around fundamental operating standards are that they are intended to be global in nature, applied to every commodity and every location where we engage in trading activities."
"with these operating standards implemented worldwide, we will know as operations professionals that risk is being mitigated and we will be able to ensure enron top management that there is consistency in operating standards worldwide."
"these global standards also should enable enron to expand its business reach more quickly, with well defined requirements with regard to trading operations."
i am not sure from the article as written that the global nature of this effort comes across.
"finally, a question regarding timing."
the last i knew after you and brent drafted this starting point for fundamental operating standards was that this was being circulated (shona took this to do after brent's return to houston) for comments to all business controllers.
"i don't believe that we are quite at the point that we can say that all business controllers worldwide have reviewed, understand and have implemented these standards."
"and not to belittle the process of creating the standards, the tough part (and the real meat behind this) will be an effective exception report on a global basis against these standards."
my commitment to rick causey is that i will have that global report in production by the end of the year.
there is much work to do in defining the content and regularity of the report and even more work to do to identify reliable sources of data for compiling the report.
"shona has commissioned mike moscoso to work on this, and i believe that mike has already been working with james new."
so i question whether or not you want to publish info about fundamental standards that we can not yet report against.
would a more appropriate time be after the global operations controller meeting in october when we should have worldwide buy-in and commitment to these standards and (hopefully) our first draft of a meaningful exception report?

there really are no material changes for texas.
the only issue that i see is the month to month change in volumes between december and november 99.
this was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (entex takes were slightly higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).
let me know if you have further questions.

i shuffled the storage deal tickets (deal 268090 and 268093) around for june.

"on tuesday, our net injection goes to 29,687 dth."

this keeps us at our 60% max storage balance on 6/30/2000.

"""i just talked to tino monaldo, dennis langley's lawyer/project manager for the pueblo project."
i explained bill and bill's credentials and concerns and tino suggested that a sit down between enron and their government contracts team might be helpful.
"he offered to do it in houston, probably late next week or the following week."
"attending would be dennis, tino, and their outside lawyers, jim slattery and rick harrington."
harrington is the key--he is a retired military guy and one of the lead govt. contracts lawyers at my old firm in dc.
"the would basically put on a dog and pony walking us all through their sole source strategy,  including their legal interpretations and the allies they have lined up within doe/dod."
bill and bill--does such a meeting sound productive?
"if so, should we have outside govt. contracts counsel present and if so, who do you suggest?"
"on a related note, tino explained (without me asking or really caring) that he was in the middle of a """"big drafting project""""--revising dennis' joint venture agreement with the isleta."
"i took the opportunity to express my concern at how far down the road dennis is getting on the overall deal, including structure issues, without knowing whether enron is even on board."
"i reminded tino that gpg has not committed to participating in the pipeline or the power plant, and that we have not obtained ena's agreement to commit turbines."
"apparently dennis believes that if the economics pans out, enron or someone else yet to be identified will magically jump in to the deal with money, turbines, etc.   if enron does eventually decide to get into this deal, the agreements and promises that dennis has already made may need to be revisited."
thanks for your patience on this project.

"yes, i thought it went well also."
"we can find a way to get a long term commitment from eott, thus changing their organization, without taking on the price risk."

ecar prices for the evening peak were offered out in the high teens to low twenties.
bids were in the low teens.
tlr's were called thus preventing power from moving down to the south.
off-peak prices were just as ugly with offers in the mid teens and no one showing a bid.
pjm called for min. gen. for a couple of hours.
after he 23 lgee began sending 365 mw's to tva.
this was the only movement of power in ecar per oasis.
for tuesday everyone will have hourly power to sell.
fe will have 200-300 mw's to move each hour.
no one had much interest in picking up a pre-schedule for tuesday.
main prices in main were a little lower than in ecar.
bids for the evening peak were in the low teens and for off peak bids were in the single digit's.
"ce, ameren, ip and wepco will have hourly power to sell."
alt bought 150 mw's on a preschedule for tuesday.
they bought this preschedule from their neighbors in the low 20's.
they will be looking to pick up another 50 mw's beginning he 9.
they will be looking to pay in the low 20's again.

i know we have not been treating storage correctly in sitara.
i would like to disscuss the best way to handle the ces storage.
it involves several pipelines.
who should i talk to?
"on some storage contracts, ena will buy the gas from ces on withdrawals and sell the gas to ces on injections."
"on other storage contracts, ces will give ena a predetermined injection schedule."
"however, ena will make the acutal injection and withdrawal decisions."
"which means, what we bill ces will be different from what actually happens."
"i know this is what we did with bug, i just don't know how to do it."
who do i need to meet with to discuss ces storage?
i hear we are staying at 68 for tomorrow at o&r.
"please see attached file for key contacts during weeks of december 18, december 25, & january 1."
"""guys, i would like to add the following commentary to the dash which will better reflect my thinking around this investment."
the current text suggests that there is significant strategic advantage for ena to be a participant in the fund.
"i do not think that is the case; however, i do see some merits in the investment based on the needs of enron's global finance group."
ena would have a requirement that this investments be hedged through raptor and be managed by the enron global finance group.

what a great time of year to make that trip.

"it is time for me to plan something fun, even a short trip."
planning and looking forward to it is 1/2 the fun.
we will come back on saturday after the game.
we have a new park & loan / storage deal on national fuel effective 6/23/2000.
"national fuel transferred 1,000,000 dth from our parking contract to our brand new firm storage contract."
we are now long fss and short pals.
"fss we have the rights to withdraw on a firm basis up to 33,333 dth per day."
"however, we need to call and get permission to withdraw more than 33,333 dth on any given day."
"also, the withdrawal takes place at an interconnect, like trco-leidy."
we do not have to ship the gas on nat fuel.
ias we give nat fuel the gas back on an it basis via our ias agreement (nat fuel is still setting up the contracts).
we can give nat fuel the gas back at any point we wish.
we do not have to pay back the gas at the same point we withdraw on the fss.
and we can pay back the gas before we withdraw it.
cost what we will probably do most of the time is take the fss into trco at leidy and payback the ias agreement at niagara and leidy.
"ena will pay nat fuel 1,000,000 dth x ($."
"125 / 3 months) or $41,666.67 per month for june, july, and august."
this deal is over on aug 31st.
i just entered the demand charge on my market east demand charge sheet.
i do not have any deals set up in sitara.
i need to see the contracts from nat fuel first.
i will keep track of the balances on an excel worksheet.
all commodity cost and fuel is capured in the $.
125 demand charge.
beavy and i will make sure the payback and withdrawal tickets are balanced in sitara once we start flowing gas on this deal.
"if we payback 60,000 dth next week and we do not have any withdrawals, then i will show a 60,000 dth withdrawal on 8/31/2000 just to keep the tickets balanced."
"payback techniques under the expert eye of the wonderfull, superfantastic, all-around great guy, dick jenkins, i've come up with some options on paying back the gas."
niagara - only works when niagara is open.
nat fuel has been very close to capacity this week.
"however, we should always see what martin can do with the gas if it gets backed up into tcpl."
"or if niagara is constrained, we can ship the gas on our firm nat fuel contract then pay it back to nat fuel, at today's prices that cost about $."
"105 wadd - take our tenn z6 length into cng via iroq, ship it to trco- leidy, and payback the gas at leidy."
"at today's prices, that cost about  $."
"055, assuming we get to roll over all of our cng fuel waivers."
tenn -   we just need to see what type of it rate dan can get to ship the gulf to tenn z4 (ellisburgh).
we can also move the dracutt to nat fuel on segmented capacity for $.
145 or  move wright to nat fuel for $.
11
we cannot use the net 284 contract on any of the tenn / nat fuel interconnects.
let me know if you have any questons.
"guys, i appreciate the updates."
"please ensure 1) that you, as ena, are integrated 2) deliver a very clear expectation with ee&cc with a credible plan and 3) that you scream bloody murder if a deliverable is missed."
you will need to bird-dog this to closure on an hourly basis to ensure that we get over the goal line.

", since they have been running numbers on the plano model for a little while now."
"i walked miguel through what i had done and how they should look at running the model, based on what thomas found out and what you have said in the past."
i also gave them the numbers that the desk has given based on the simple cycle case (5 year number) and combine-cycle case (5 year number).
from this they have modeled and graphed these different scenarios.

"""tony & frazier -- several comments from tw commercial."
"page 1:  streamlined credit -- what does """"interested parties"""" mean?"
"parties interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their credit ?"
"probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional."
(don't we want everyone to get approval ahead of bidding?).
"page 2:  you state that """"individual bid transactions are kept confidential."""
""" what is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?"
the bid itself?
"in tw's ios, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of the shipper."
"we feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend online bids be posted in real time."
"i notice you call them """"sealed bids"""" on page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them."
page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?
especially since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.
our credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between 2 and 4 on bid day.
"if we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351)."
"page 7:  """"an"""" capacity trading agreement should be """"a"""" capacity trading agreement."
"page 8:  so we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we plan to have the request for service and the service agreement available for online submittal at some point in the near future."
"also, we've never asked shippers to submit a request for service with each bid."
a shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.
"they really only need to submit the request for service at the time of, or prior to, the first bid."
"i recommend stating """"you must submit a request for service prior to making your initial bid"""" so they don't think they have to submit a new one every time they revise their bid."
"page 9:  under """"when tw will respond"""":  need to specify how notification will be sent."
"page 14:  column that says """"price"""" should say """"rate"""" (for a second there we thought you were talking about gas prices)."
"also, please use example rates that are more realistic for tw (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...) thanks for all your hard work on this."

"we can still build the adjusted units in the original production schedules, given the timely authority to proceed in that new direction."
"if the units are built according to the new re-designed parameters , abb would have to make the necessary material and performance changes to get to enron's desired characteristics, especially for the impedance change and the necessity to perform in a higher ambient temperature."
"overall this re-design will require a price adder to each of the 2 transformers, of $49,500.00/each .  key factors in this cost adder would be the engineering re-design effort, the additional radiators required, and the use of high delivery fans."
that drafting effort has been put on hold until these redesign issues are resolved.

please advise when you think that we will have feedback on these changes from enron.

i'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of activity lately related to enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.
john goodpasture's group has kept a large number of et&s people engaged in looking at a number of potential deals.
"while these deal evaluation projects have become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are extremely confidential."
"even after a potential seller has announced that it is up for sale, the fact that enron is looking at a potential deal, as well as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential."
i realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the future.
"if you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at the target company asks whether enron is evaluating the contact's company or assets, the only appropriate response is that enron personnel are not permitted to discuss potential acquisitions."
please be aware that the confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition evaluation process preclude any communication by enron people with employees of the target company.
"if you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do not hesitate to give me a call."
thank you for your assistance.

to whom it may concern: in previous years enron has sponsored athletic tournaments for it's employees.
i have participated in tournaments ranging from softball to flag football.
"in addition, enron has been very invloved with charitable organizations in the community."
"with these two things in mind, i wanted to propose a flag football tournament to benefit a charitable organiztion."
i know that some of the budgets for sports clubs have been reduced (including flag football) recently.
"this is a way that enron can support employee interaction and wellness and, at the same time, give back to the community."
my questions are : is this idea plausible?
"if so, who should i contact with regards to setting up the tournament?"
"thanks in advance, eric bass x3-0977"
i think we are making great progress on the systems side.
"i would like to set a deadline of november 10th to have a plan on all north american projects (i'm ok if fundementals groups are excluded) that is signed off on by commercial, sally's world, and beth's world."
when i say signed off i mean that i want signitures on a piece of paper that everyone is onside with the plan for each project.
if you don't agree don't sign.
if certain projects (ie. the gas plan) are not done yet then lay out a timeframe that the plan will be complete.
i want much more in the way of specifics about objectives and timeframe.

a w4 calculates how much federal tax to withhold from your paycheck each pay period.
there are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing status.
"the higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld."
married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.
"there is really no good or bad answer, only opinion."
"if you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on april 15th, then claim more dependents and married and jointly."

"remember we need to make a filing for our bp energy deal, which becomes effective dec. 1."
"(mary, i think you and i talked about this several weeks ago)."
the contract simply includes a right of first refusal for bp energy.
"the contract is such that the shipper would not have been entitled to a rofr under our tariff, which is why it's a material deviation."
the filing will simply need to reference a tariff sheet on which the contract provision is described.
"let me know if you need anything (a copy of the contract, for instance)."
i have a conf. call from 2 to 3 but otherwise should be available if you want to give me a call.
congratulations.

"jeff, you would clearly receive a commission on a deal on the sagewood."
i am surprised by your request for payment on any type of project in which i might become involved with creekside.
are you in the business of brokering properties or contacts?
is your position based on a legal or what you perceive to be an ethical issue?
did you propose we look at developing a project from scratch?
i am not prepared to pay more than 2.7 for sagewood yet.
phillip
great!
we've got a meeting set for 9 am on wed on the regulatory structure of the pipeline.
"also, i talked to kevin and tim separately today on the market research issue."
i think tim could probably identify the specific electric rate pnm charges doe at sandia and dod at kirtland as well as the general tariff rate for large industrial service.
"if we are lucky, there might be some info in pnm's last rate case on the discounted electric rates it gives specific large industrials (if any)."
"obviously, any info on gas or elec. loads and rates would be useful."
"kevin, i told tim you'd give him a call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get tim started."
i got a call this afternoon from tino.
he asked our help on right of way issues with bnsf.
"could steve, kevin or lorraine take point on trying to find out if we or anyone within enron has a good contact at bnsf that we could use?"
lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid tipping pnm that enron is involved.
"just in general on the confidentiality issue, tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the current leglislative session in santa fe ends feb. 17."
we need to be absolutely sure that we don't tip pnm off that we are talking to langley before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are supporting on the plains-tri state merger.
tim believes pnm could spike that leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.
"that issue is real immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal (even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation)."
tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  doe has 6000mmbtu/d of pure gas load at sandia in addition to elec. load.
no number yet on kirtland gas load.
"also, tino has heard that a guy named jeff sturba will likely replace montoya at pnm before the end of the year."
has anyone else heard that?  do we know him?
we will deliver 46 dth to tenn nyseg meter 020221on contract 31533 at first of the month prices.
"also, we are selingl you the 600 dth of cng delivered at $5.00 for the rest of the month."
sure thing!
"i am planning to be out friday, oct. 27 and monday, oct. 30."
"brad, he is a great kid."
i hope his interviews go well tomorrow.
vince
"this would be analogous to every time you send me an e-mail, i forward it directly to drew and maria."
how do you tactfully advise your coworkers about corporate etiquette?
"i'll e-mail her right now, and send her money on wednesday."
"lia hernandez, currently of et&s, has accepted a position at ena effective august 2, 2000."
"to ensure that et&s continues to be in compliance with the marketing affiliate rules, lia's access to any et&s or gpg-related lans or applications should be removed at the close of business on august 1."
"in addition, lia's email profile should be changed and any gpg or et&s mass distribution  lists should be changed."
"please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, verifying and indicating the date that employee was: - removed from the lan - ebb password was changed/canceled (if applicable) - removed from et&s or gpg-related applications - email post office box was transfered."
"if you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else i need to contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know."
"hey brenda, i was wondering if you guys went to disney world yet."
"we went and had a good time, although it was very hot."

"""enron: withdrawing 300 mw from summer peaking program wednesday, november 1, 2000 02:18 pm ?"
"mail this article to a friend (corrected 1:59 pm) new york (dow jones)--in response to new california power market rules proposed wednesday by the u.s. federal energy regulatory commission, enron corp (ene, news, msgs) has canceled some new generator projects it was discussing with the state's electric grid operator, enron said."
"the generators that are no longer financially feasible would have amounted to 300 megawatts of new generation installed in california next spring, enron said."
"the company, however, continues to negotiate other new generator projects with the california independent system operator."
the ferc wednesday proposed limiting the california power exchange's price setting mechanism to $150 a megawatt-hour.
"the preliminary order could become a federal mandate by the end of the year, after the ferc takes comments from the public, or it could be modified."
"enron and 13 other companies, meanwhile, are in final negotiations with the iso for the new peaking capacity for next summer."
"the iso plans to pay a total of $255 million a year for three years to the power companies for installing the new generators, which the power companies will own."
"in addition, california's three investor-owned utilities would pay the generators for any electricity the new generators produce."
"pricing for the power would likely be based on the daily price set by the state-chartered calpx. """
"""there's too much uncertainty that we would be able to recover the cost associated with those specific projects."
"for the purposes of making capital commitments, we view this as a $150 price cap,"""" enron's mark palmer said."
"earlier wednesday, the iso's chief operating officer, terry winter, expressed concern that ferc's proposed new rules could jeopardize some of the projects."
"ferc's proposals wednesday are the result of a two-month investigation of california's wholesale electricity market, where prices this summer were three times what they were a year earlier."
"to meet the state's rising demand for power, california's three utilities have paid billions of dollars more than anticipated to independent power producers in order to keep the lights on."

i've already been to visit her once there and she's trying to talk me into moving over there.
"i would actually love to go, if there was a job with enron there that interested me."
"as for my dating life, it is relatively unchanged."
"i was seeing one guy for a while, really liked him, things were going great ( i thought )."
..then he seemed to loose interest and decided 2 mos. into things to tell me he has issues and that he'd been married before.
"needless to say, that was pretty much the end of things."
"it's made me a little hesitant when it comes to meeting new guys, but at the same time i had so much fun in the beginning that i'm still optimistic about my dating future."
how about you?
concerning kappa...i'll give you a run down on everyone i still keep in touch with.
corey's in law school at texas ( doing great of course) and has already secured a clerkship with a federal judge in galveston when she graduates.
jessica bateman is now jessica pulliam - and she too is in law school at texas and has secured a federal clerkship with a judge in dallas when she graduates.
elizabeth's is in med school in san antonio and dating a fellow med student there.
stephanie spence is now stephanie williams and is living and working in dallas.
"lisa meador is getting married next april to a guy from texas ( he was a ka, there brad thealman (sp?) ) who is absolutely perfect for her."

"at this point i'm not planning to file the agreement, just a report as requested by the commission."
i'm still working with ecs to finalize the agreement.
"their attorney is checking with his resident experts to make sure ecs, by expressly giving tw operational control, does not somehow cross the line into retail wheeling."
i do not expect the agreement to change significantly.

hector has still referred to the key players under jeff gossett as managers.
"however, only one of these (will kelly) is a manager."
the remainder are senior specialists.
let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in detail.
we are potentially exposed for steve jackson to hire some of these players away.
"steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our competitor, which will require that he have good people."
"he will be moving to columbus, ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire."
"he does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or childless, their mobility factors could be high."
enron would not want to lose any other talent to steve's new employer.

molly set up the following tickets to capture our cgas storage transactions.
"this is how it will work, deal #  comment 268093  ces exchange buy - use when storage injections are less than the proxy volume 268090  ces exchange sell - use when storage injections are greater than the proxy volume 268094  ces sell - this is the proxy storage injection ticket."
the volume should not change.
"the daily proxy volume for the month of may is 35,133."
"when we inject 35,133, the transport we use to fill storage will be the supply for deal 268094."
"when we overinject like we did for the 1st - 4th, 35,133 of the transport will be matched with deal 268094 and the balance of the transport will be matched against deal 268090."
"when we underinject, we will use deal 268093 as the supply for deal 268094."
this may seem a little confusing.
please call me if you still have questions.

"jeff, can you spend a little time thinking about the current north american energy markets (very high energy prices, stretched infrastructure, etc) and determine which game changing or altering technologies, business models or existing corporate positions that will benefit from such price and volatility levels."
"in particular, i think that miller should take a look at coal gasification technologies, emissions technologies and dsm/efficiency technologies and how these investments may fit in the charter or our overall business."
"as well, from a corporate development point of view which parts of the value chain ie) ipp, e&p, utility, assets, etc are undervalued given current commodity curves and expectations."

"gary, any interest in this candidate?"
"shelley, my colleague, clayton vernon, who has a background in  economics, wrote a short summary of arguments against the rofr."
we are working on the second approach to the problem: we try to come up with a numerical estimate of the value of this option.
the fact that an incumbent shipper has this option has distributional consequences: he has something  of value he never paid for.
having a numerical estimate of the value of this option could help to argue against it.
the value of such an option is case specific;
how big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys looking at that adjustment?
"or, are you letting the buyer know this option exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)?"
i just entered a deal in sitara (deal 399824).

are the units he is selling significantly different from yours?

i received a call from jill zively about our supply at mtr 5999.
"late friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into midcon instead of hpl."
"the nomination into hpl for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d.  jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at gas daily."
i changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for saturday forward.
"since this is priced at gas daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact."
we need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary.

"two weeks ago i toured the depelchin center, one of the organizations that receives much of its funding from the united way."
i was surprised to find out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster parents.
i had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to the center.
learning about the important programs offered through depelchin and meeting four year-old jessica and ten year-old steven who were temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to have made that pledge.
enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit organizations.
"hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your charitable giving during the year."
the united way campaign is the one time each year that enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a difference in the lives of so many in houston.
each dollar pledged by an employee is matched by enron.
"if you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing so as soon as possible."
"our united way campaign draws to its conclusion next wednesday, august 23."
i hope that each one of you will consider making a pledge.
"there is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all enron employees can make a significant positive impact for houston.  log on to http://unitedway.enron.com to complete your pledge card."
thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic pledge.
i have not taken any time off.

what's up with that?
my advice on the outward bound thing is to hold off.
"not for selfish, wine-swilling reasons, of course; but because i know how tiring it gets to be living out of a suitcase with no dinero for a period of time."
i have to say that sticking around portland for the last six months has given me a renewed sense of mental health.
"granted, i'm not totally sane yet, but at least i can imagine what it would be like."
"if you came home and turned right around and went to colorado, you'd feel unprepared and maybe a little overwhelmed."
think carefully about how much outward bound would pay you in comparison with how much money you actually need to get by.
"then add $500/month to that figure, and you'll be about right."
it always sounds easier than the reality - i'm only speaking from maui experience here.
"if you want to do a whirlwind denver thing and have a great, rustic, totally broke time, then totally go for it."
but if you feel like you're getting to the end of your rope with scraping by and feeling unsettled - which it kind of sounds like you are - then hang in p-town for awhile.
"like i said, i'd feel soooo much better about taking off on my next adventure now than i would have even a couple months ago."
and it's only been six months since i got back - that's not really too long to wait.
"in the meantime, you don't have to live with mom."

what is the latest hunter
"""charlene:  outlined below are the points i promised to send you before our meeting on wednesday morning."
"i don't know your agenda for the meeting, so it may or may not be appropriate to discuss all of these items tomorrow."
"background:  as a long-time supporter of the analyst program, i became concerned over the last several months as frustration emerged from other supporters of the program."
many of those expressing frustration are heavily involved in the recruiting process.
it is their commitment to both recruiting and providing analyst rotations that has been key in attracting talented candidates to what has been the merchant services analyst program.
"i initiated a meeting, announced at rick causey's staff meeting, that would bring us together so that we could consolidate our concerns and then discuss them with you in a constructive manner."
our intent is continued support and improvement of the program.
not much materialized from that point to clarify what that meant or how that would be managed.
"in fact, those of us involved heavily in the recruiting process saw that the msap and the commercial anlayst programs were managed separately and differently in terms of campus recruiting, rotations and orientation."
we feel uninformed and therefore are hampered in discussing the analyst program on campus.
single start date:  the single start date of july 17 for analysts is impractical and inflexible; a concern from our points of view for an innovative company.
"the july start date does not consider december graduates and is not necessarily practical for undergrads whose graduation dates are in may. lack of communication:   we are some of the most involved and committed senior managers in the msap, and yet we have received little information or communication about the program."
"we hear rumors of """"tracks"""", but no facts or details."
"some of us had heard about the single july start date, and some had not."
"commercial focus too heavy:  presentation materials, the attitudes of support staff in the associates/analysts program and interview processes are heavily focused on commercial needs, without understanding support needs."
"lack of input from biggest supporters:  given the time and effort that many of us put into the msap, we are concerned that we haven't been asked to join with you in some of your plans for the program."
we are concerned that decisions (example:  the single start date) are being considered in a vacuum without what could be some valuable input from some of us.
"msap has taken a step backward:  previously, with a dedicated leadership team and staff, the msap had made great strides in the consistency of our on campus efforts, the quality of candidates, the acceptance rate of top candidates and the pride of participants in the program."
"we feel that the focus on the msap has diminished considerably over the last nine months, and we are anxious to work with you to renew excitment for the program."
"summary concerns/discussion points: disc"""
lets talk about this tomorrow--obviously this changes the facts somewhat.

"07:15:54 am<br>rodney- merrill lynch has reviewed the transaction that was executed with enron in december, 1999 involving physically and financially settled call options on certain mid-continent peakers owned by enron."
"at that time, a fee of approximately $17 million was charged to execute the transaction."
"since the execution of the trade, merrill lynch has had to manage the risk associated with the sizeable position as well as hedge certain gas basis risks that merrill lynch was obligated to assume in order to accommodate the accounting treatment desired by enron as part of the transaction."
"additionally, as i am sure that you and your traders are aware, the position has considerably appreciated in value since trade execution."
"even with these factors, merrill lynch is prepared to accommodate enron's request to terminate the transaction in exchange for a fee of $17 million."
this fee encompasses the original fee that enron had agreed to pay to merrill lynch and does not take into consideration any of merrill lynch's hedge breakage costs or our foregone upside in the trade.

emmisions trading will go from kevin presto  (greg wolfe) to george mcclellan under the following  conditions.
1 -  volumes will not fall.
in fact they will increase.
"2 - wolfe will retain 1 million of the 3 million var for six months and then east power will have no emmisions positions, 3 -  janel guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal."
4 - east power and coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that greg is not keeping.

retailers saw the biggest increase; their inventories rose 1.2% in june.
"total business sales were also up 0.9% in june, a slightly weaker showing than the revised 1.1% rise posted in may. the inventory-to-sales ratio--the number of months it would take to empty the nation's warehouses, store shelves, and sales lots at the current rate of sales--remained at 1.32, just off its all-time low."
"in a separate report, the fed said industrial production rose 0.4% in july, double the pace in june."

"""midam advised us they intend to call the enforcement hotline, probably today, to get enforcement staff involved in resolving the carlton timing problem (i.e., the absence of an order approving or not approving the settlement)."
"if midam does so, enforcement will then contact northern for a response--probably dari or mkm or i, but who knows who they'll call."
"if they do, the following bullets are important to convey as our preliminary response to midam: 1."
"midam, and all of our customers, are aware that a commission order on the june 2, 2000 settlement is necessary before the precise flow obligation for this nov-march period can be determined."
the flow obligation for sourcers like midam will be slightly higher--by about 3%--if the settlement is approved.
"for all customers that have asked what the precise flow obligation numbers would be under the two scenarios, settlement approval or settlement non-approval, we have given that information."
we gave that information to midam also.
we can't file the tariff sheets setting out the specific number for this heating season until the commission addresses the settlement.
2
the true financial impact of the current uncertainty on midam is minimal.
"we believe many of the sourcers have locked in their supply based on the lower flow obligation number, but with an option to increase their purchase quantity if the commission approves the settlement."
"midam may have done that, but we don't know."
"if not, and if the commission approves the settlement, their only real """"cost"""" would arise if they have to buy the additional flow obligation volume--about 1100 mmbtu/d for midam--now at a higher price than they would have paid if they bought it earlier when they locked up the bulk of their flow obligation supply."
"given the large drop in gas prices the last several days, there may not be any increased cost."
3
the bottom line is that we really need an order on the settlement.
the majority of northern's customers support it as a fair solution to the carlton problem.
midam is the only opponent that has raised substantive issues.
midam is clinging to a financial windfall it gets under the old carlton mechanism and has no reason to oppose the settlement other than preserving that windfall.
that's the end of the proposed script.
"the last bullet may go to far, but i like it."
"frank and steve, mkm suggested that you guys get doering and gorak and others to call ferc (hotline or otherwise--i don't think it matters) and express their concern that the order is not on the agenda."

"on a different note, i was wondering if someone in your shop could map the current a&a process from planning for on-campus recruitment to manager promotion  for the typical associate including timeline."
this process mapping should be very detailed to give us the greatest insight.
i think radical change is not the answer.
the answer lies in a combination of a) slight changes in process; b) increasing participation/ownership at key points in the process by certain business units and people; and c) a credible key business spokesman or spokespersons co-opting the other units where necessary and providing the commercial leadership and representation for the program internally.
overall this is a commercial program that needs to meet commercial objectives - the closer to the front the better.

"""my only warning is that working for sheila is that she takes over most of the big stuff, even if it is your deal."
"everything that she is working on now was one of her lawyers' deals, but """"things just weren't getting done""""."
she can be very unclear in what she expects from you.
she is the ultimate micro-manager.
"she may hire the outside counsel on """"your"""" deal, then tell you about it later, not consulting you to find out who you want to use."
"this style may not bother you, as you may in fact get comfort from working closely with someone."
"clearly, she has a lot of experience to impart, and she is very, very nice."
"i'm sure there will be a downside to working with jeff and barbara, i just haven't been in the group long enough to have an opinion."
"kay ps.  i thought this time i would give you full disclosure..."""
i'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of activity lately related to enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.
john goodpasture's group has kept a large number of et&s people engaged in looking at a number of potential deals.
"while these deal evaluation projects have become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are extremely confidential."
"even after a potential seller has announced that it is up for sale, the fact that enron is looking at a potential deal, as well as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential."
i realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the future.
"if you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at the target company asks whether enron is evaluating the contact's company or assets, the only appropriate response is that enron personnel are not permitted to discuss potential acquisitions."
please be aware that the confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition evaluation process preclude any communication by enron people with employees of the target company.
"if you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do not hesitate to give me a call."
thank you for your assistance.

hey!
"i believe we need to assign someone from the central desk to be the point person for ces central desk activity, for pricing and scheduling issues."
ces currently has issues with the btu conversions at the different michcon citygates.
ena delivers the gas to different michcon citygates and each one has a different btu factor.
this causes ces to be long or short depending on the conversion factor.
i'm not sure if there is anything we can do about it but i would prefer to have someone from the central desk address this issue.

is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?
i think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one important caveat.
the individuals in question must be in the same strata.
i would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could be beat by joe shmoe who runs every day at memorial park.
of course if one is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy gets really old and slow.

"riday july 7, 11:43 am eastern time company press release source: columbia gas transmission columbia gas transmission files innovative capacity auction process with ferc fairfax, va., july 7 /prnewswire/ -- continuing its quest to promote creative regulatory policies, columbia gas transmission, a wholly owned subsidiary of columbia energy group, has urged the federal energy regulatory commission to consider an interactive, internet-based pipeline capacity auction process that enhances columbia's current open auction process."
"in a first of its kind filing, columbia proposes a ``bid/offer'' system for selling capacity similar to on-line natural gas commodity trading systems."
"the filing was made in response to customer concerns with the current process and is consistent with sentiments expressed in ferc's order 637, which encourages companies to voluntarily submit ``new and innovative approaches'' to capacity auctions."
"since the filing is not required under order 637, columbia's proposed auction is separate from columbia's order 637 compliance filing made june 15."
"``under the current mechanism, capacity is not always awarded to the party that places the highest value on it,'' said carl levander, vice-president of rates and regulatory policy for columbia gas transmission."
"``even though we conduct our current capacity auction over a five-day period, parties often wait until the last 15 minutes to place a bid."
"also, since the current process is based on set time periods, customers often call us back after the auction is closed saying they valued the capacity greater than the winning bid."
"'' according to levander, columbia's proposal addresses these concerns by moving to an enhanced, internet-based interactive auction that takes into consideration such current market conditions as daily fluctuations in capacity value and the increased level of auction activity due to shorter-term contracts."
"under columbia's proposed ``bid/offer'' system, columbia would ``offer'' (via its electronic bulletin board) sales terms for all its available firm capacity."
customers can then match all asking sales terms for any portion of the quantity and a sale is immediate and binding.
"if columbia offers discounted capacity, the customer can counter-offer with a different rate."
"or, if columbia offers maximum rate capacity, then a customer can counter-offer with a different term length."
"columbia can match the highest bid, subject to a present value process, and the sale is immediate and binding."
"at any time before a binding sale, the customer can change or withdraw its bid."
columbia's ``bid/offer'' auction proposal meets the six basic principles outlined in ferc's order 637.
*     columbia's auction has predictable timing since the auction will begin each day at 9:15 a.m. (est) and all available capacity will be posted prior to 8:00 a.m. (est).
*     the auction will be open to all creditworthy bidders on a non- discriminatory basis.
*     the auction is user-friendly since it will use columbia's existing ebb format.
all information concerning rules and procedures will be made available on the internet.
*     the method of selecting the best bid will be easily understood since bidders will only be able to change one variable with respect to each capacity package made available.
"*     as is columbia's current practice, winning bids and the bidder's identity will be posted to permit monitoring of how the selection criteria were applied."
*     the bidding process will be transparent to all parties since all bids (without the bidder's identity) will be available for review to all bidders through an internet-based system.
"``we believe the combination of these factors will ensure that the capacity auction format is 'transparent, verifiable, and non-discriminatory' to all parties as well as innovative in design,'' levander said."
"levander said the proposal not only meets the commission's principles, it is based on feedback gathered from customers, who expressed a desire for transparent market information; shorter auction periods; an ability to withdraw and change bids; and a real-time, immediate closure process."
"columbia gas transmission, with offices in charleston, w.va., and fairfax, va., moves an average of three billion cubic feet of natural gas per day to markets along a 12,550-mile pipeline network, which reaches across 10 midwestern, northeastern and mid-atlantic states."
the company operates one of the largest natural gas storage systems in the country with over 240 billion cubic feet (bcf) of working capacity.
"columbia energy group, based in herndon, va., is one of the nation's leading energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion."
"its operating companies engage in nearly all phases of the natural gas business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum product sales, and electric power generation."

"""with regard to the commission's limitations on the right of first refusal, order 637 provides for grandfathering of discounted long-term contracts that are now subject to rofr."
the commission's rationale was that grandfathering gives all shippers notice of the new limitation and the opportunity to re-execute current contracts.
the tw commercial group has asked whether we should challenge the grandfathering of existing contracts.
"in limiting the right of first refusal, the commission has expressly acknowledged that if a customer is truly captive and has no alternatives for service, it is likely that its contract will be at the maximum rate."
"shippers that are not captive and have alternatives in the marketplace do not need the protection of rofr, and the pipeline should be able to negotiate with other interested shippers upon expiration of the contract."
"in light of these conclusions, there should be no reason to grandfather the rofr rights of shippers under existing discounted contracts."
"such shippers would not be harmed by removal of the right immediately upon the effective date of a pipeline's tariff filing to limit the right of first refusal (assuming the service contract incorporates tariff terms on an """"as amended"""" basis)."
"consistent with the commission's order, it would not be unfair to make these shippers compete with others for the capacity upon expiration of the contract."""

"okay so, five hours at work and so far no fallout from christmas party shenanigans!"

fyi.
i got this from mike late last week.
any comments?
it looks very early in their development but mike may want them to talk to a couple of people here about their site.
we need to be helpful if it will help his business.
dan are you up to speed on this?

i took the volume on deal 226742 (devonian resources) to 0 for april.
"hey john, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this."
"also, send me your phone number."
i can't find it.
"""steve and lindy, as i mentioned in our staff meeting, it is probably not  going to be possible to solve our max rate cap dilemma by making a tariff=   filing unless we can 1) get ferc to change its mind about its policy that=   recourse rates always be available as an alternative to negotiated rates or=   2) prove that transwestern lacks market power and should therefore be allow= ed  to charge market based rates."
the following is a very brief outline of what would be required to prove la= ck  of market power.
a warning:  lack of market power is very difficult to  prove.
"koch, a pipeline that most in the industry would agree does lack  market power, tried and failed."
the deck is already stacked against us in=   tw's case given the withholding of capacity by el paso's affiliate and the=   price conditions in california.
"however, we do need to analyze the  possibilities for tw, if not to the cal."
"border, then on other parts of our=   system."
"additionally, we need to discuss acceptable incentives for shipper= s  to pay negotiated rates if we do not end up changing our tariff."
would you be availabile on tuesday to discuss this?
please let me know.
"i= n  the meantime, here is a summary of ferc's policy on market based rates."
"*** to obtain authority to charge market based rates, tw would first have to  request a declaratory order, and in its application provide information  showing it meets the requirements outlined below."
"if the commission finds=   all requirements have been met, it will issue an order and tw would then ma= ke  the appropriate tariff filing to put market based rates into effect.   application for declaratory order must include: 1."
detailed description of the services proposed for market-based rate  treatment.
i assume in our case it would be firm transportation service.
2
a statement defining the relevant product and geographic markets  necessary for establishing the applicant lacks market power with respect to=   the services at issue.
"the commission requires a narrow definition of the=   market=01(""""firm transportation"""" is probably narrow enough, but for our purp= oses  we might want to narrow it down more (i.e., firm transportation east of  thoreau)."
"we have to define substitute services available to shippers=01(o= ther  pipelines are a """"good substitute"""" only if shippers can obtain the same  quality of service on a timely basis, and if the other pipelines offer such=   service at a price that would deter tw from raising its prices more than  10%."
"all relevant """"origin markets"""" must be defined (panhandle; west texas)=   as well as """"destination markets,"""" and alternatives for shippers in those  markets identified."
transportation alternatives are only good alternatives=   if they provide a netback to shippers that is roughly the same as if they=   used tw.
note that the commission has rejected capacity release as a good=   alternative since it does not guarantee a shipper its desired contract  quantity.
3
market share and hhi calculations; discussion of other relevant  competitive factors.
"commission looks at size of market share, mitigating=   factors such as ease of entry, and market concentration as measured by hhi."
#name?
hhi is calculated by adding up the total market share and=   squaring it.
there is a presumption of no ease of entry for transportation=   services  because of the expense involved in constructing facilities.

everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count.
it should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening.
"hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome."
"""we are now addressing the distasteful task of sorting through the mountain of files accumulated during the conoco litigation."
kathy is taking the lead on reviewing our document retention policies and advising britt and i of what she thinks we can destroy and what we need to keep.
"in some instances, the appropriate approach is not entirely clear."
"have you folks run across any """"document retention policy specialists"""" that she ought to talk to?"
"we have a fairly detailed policy applicable to """"interstate law"""" (which i guess means gpg law--the policy document is fairly old) but i'm less clear on what authority or right legal has to enforce the doc. retention policy as to other groups."
rod hayslett suggested during conoco that it would be good if legal followed up now and then and made sure that pack rats were following the policy.
"his comment arose from a little situation in which we were served with requests for """"3 year plans"""" and rod was displeased  to learn that some folks had kept old plans from 10 years ago."
he (and i suspect all of us) would be happier if that didn't happen again.

"well, i don't really know what to tell you."
i don't know dave and all i really know is what you have told me which is that he has a bad temper and appears to have an alcohol problem.
i am sure he must be a good guy if you have been dating him this long though.
speaking of alcohol i have kind of come to a realization recently that i need to cut down on my own drinking.
that is part of the reason i didn't drink this weekend.
"i am not going to stop going out for a few beers but, i am just tired of how i feel the next day and just laying around and shit."
and the thing with my dad has really scared me into being more  healthy.
although it doesn't seem to really show to much i have been going to the gym 5-6 days a week and i just don't want to be my dads age and be looking at the kind of health problems that he is havning right now.
i think for you the best thing to do right now is to figure out whether you think you have a big enough future with dave to go through with trying to help him with the problem.
if you think you do and the drinking thing is an issue to you then you need to bring it up again when he is sober but  if you don't think so then maybe you should consider walking away.
good luck and if you need someone to talk to or advice you can always count on me.

we should know the actual volume in the next day or so.
note:  ces is not taking any carnagie gas at cpa.
national fuel 250 dth/day from belden & blake.
the deal expires 6/30/2000.
equitrans all of the equitrans is production or pool gas on the pipeline.
ena nominates this gas.
"ces still has a citygate load of 1,280 dth/day for june on equitrans so the production gas will be delivered to ces."

"""i agree that the proposed facilities could be constructed under the prior notice provisions of tw's blanket certificate if the cost and environmental requirements are met."
"the facilities appear to meet the criteria for an """"eligible facility"""" under section 157.202(b)(2)(i):  they are necessary to provide service to big sandy within existing mainline certificate levels, and according to my research the facilities are similar to those that the commission routinely has found to be eligible under a blanket certificate."
"the prior notice project cost limit for year 2000 is $20,200,000."
(sec. 157.208).
if the project is not within this cost limit we will need to seek a 7(c) certificate.
"i've researched the incremental rate question and here's what i've been able to find out: in the context of a 7(c) application, ferc generally requires use of existing part 284 rates."
this was the case when tw applied for a certificate to construct the san juan lateral.
tw requested a separate zone rate for the lateral in that proceeding but ferc stated that a section 7 proceeding was not the appropriate forum.
"the commission stated, however, that it would be willing to entertain an abbreviated section 4 filing by tw to revise its part 284 rates to inclue zone rates for the lateral."
so tw made a section 4 filing and got zone rates approved based on the cost of service for the lateral.
"whether we construct the big sandy lateral under the blanket certificate or not, it appears that we would have to file a limited section 4 if we want to implement rates for the lateral that are different from the west of thoreau rates."
"as for whether an open season would be required, i assume it would not be if caithness is going to fully subscribe the capacity on the lateral."
"however, if other shippers are interested and we want to get the best rate we'll probably want to have an open season."
"in any event, in the context of a 7(c) application ferc is going to put us at risk for recovery of costs, so it would be to our advantage to sell 100%"""

"*  enron will also pay newalb $2.00/mw hour for varialbe o&m. *  this will create an entity """"newalb"""" that will return 9% assuming a book value of $336/kw on 12/31/2005 vs. 409 currently."

015 bid     .

she's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she is.
2) the only reason i would take up jogging is so that i could hear heavy breathing again.
"3) i joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks."
haven't lost a pound.
apparently you have to show up.
4) i have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what i'm doing.
5) i don't exercise at all.
"if god meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body."
"6) i like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me."
"7) i have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them."

i thought i would just follow up on progress being made in tva on our settlement process.
"as well, i understand that there has been a number of communications between tva and enron on the noxtech emissions business."
i have encouraged the enron folks to pursue this opportunity with tva given the larger dialogue.
the enron team has told me that tva  wishes to move to firm pricing and a mou on this technology.
"given the larger dialogue, i have suggested to our team to hold tight on completing the agreement until both tva and enron have a view on where the overall settlement discussions are going."
please give me a call at your earliest convenience.

"""i'm soooo good."
"the chosen path was cool, indifference."
"so, last night was steak night and with nick and wilson both in town we had a really good showing."
"i got there about 7:30 with nick, and the group's size swelled to about 12+ by 8:30 - 9:00."
about 8:00 i saw kevin (ted's pal - the one you meet a steak night) wandering around lw's obviously in search of someone.
can you believe it?
he (ted) knew i had organized this gathering - i know that because nick is working right across from he and darren and overheard darren encouraging ted's attendance (mind you ted was not in the email distribution) - and he had the nerve to come.
"anyway, kevin saw me and came over to chat."
"he informed me that """"our friend ted should be there shortly"""" to which i responded, """"you would know better than me at this point""""."
the subject was dropped until he felt the need to raise it again.
"he asked if ted and i parted on good terms/ bad terms, etc.  i said there really weren't any terms, i just hadn't heard a peep out of him for about 2 weeks."
kevin wanted to know if i was going to break a bottle over ted's head and cause a big scene.
"when i said no, i think he was genuinely disappointed."
"i said in order for me to do something like that i would have to care about the """"loss"""" and that, while a week or two earlier i might have cared a bit more, with each passing day the """"loss"""" seems less and less like much of a loss."
kevin told me i was better-off without ted.
"to go even further, he informed me that there is no way he would ever let a daughter of his date ted nor any of his """"girl-friends""""."
"he said that while he thought ted was a great guy (i.e. fun to be around, good stories, etc.) he wasn't good dating material."
"i agreed with kevin saying """"ted is a great guy, he just makes a lousy man"""" (don't you like that one?)."
"i then went on to say """"anyway, i'm destined for bigger and better things, right?"
"""""."
"kevin: """"much bigger and much better."""
"""  about this time my parents showed up...the plot thickens."
i introduced kevin to my parents and since both my dad and kevin were in the navy and attended colorado they had much to talk about.
"the two of them had probably been talking for about half an hour when """"dum-da-dum-dum"""" ted shows up."
he approaches our group because he sees kevin and is forced to make eye-contact with me.
"i give him a """"hey"""" and he gives me the arm squeeze and a much too pleasant """"how's it going?"
"""""."
"he asked what kevin and my dad were talking about, i told him the navy, he said don't get kevin started or you'll never shut him up...then he walked away."
he never acknowledged my parents nor did he ever speak to me again the rest of the evening.
"the beautiful thing is kevin stays and talks with my dad for another half hour and when darren shows up he hangs out with """"my group"""" for quite a while before going to join ted."
my parents and i ate our steaks right behind ted and then went back over to our group at the picnic table when we were finished.
it really was a great night.
i would almost say i was glowing (i was having so much fun with my friends and family and it wasn't a show for ted's benefit...i really was having a great time).
"so, when my parents decide to head out they walked over to ted/kevin's table to say good-bye to kevin."
it was awesome.
ted's sitting right next to kevin while kevin and my dad are talking and appears to be actually shrinking in his chair.
yet again no acknowledgement of my parents - he couldn't even make eye-contact.
i ended up staying there for at least another hour and then went with a few of the guys to the ale house.
needless to say i was very hung over today.
"anyway, there's the story...he's a complete and utter ass-hole."
so i'm done.
"and no, there is no way he could weasel his way back in to my good graces."
"now on to a fun subject, my trip to london."
"i bought my ticket today ( i think i got hosed a little bit, but it was the cheapest ticket i could find - $450 before taxes)."
i will arrive at heathrow airport around 7:00 a.m. friday the 6th and depart about 11:00 a.m. on tuesday the 10th.
"i'm very excited about the trip, i really need to get out of houston."
i leave the activities in your capable hands.
( bear in mind i will have to see darren and nick at some point).

wow.
who would have thunk it.
prompt gas at $6+ and z/f as wide as last year.
hard to think of a better scenario for it to flip.
"rather, hard to think of any scenario for any z/f to be contango."
if it couldn't do it this year.... a lot of boys max withdrawing out of storage because that's what the curve told them to do last bid week.
"obviously, more gas trying to come out than is being burned, so you have to incentivize an economic player, like an enron, to inject."
"problem is if we stick it in the ground now, we're pulling it out in g.  when you had z/g at 35 back and cash getting priced off g, cash/z looks awfully weak, thus putting a lot of pressure on z/f.  storage economics will always dictate this market except maybe latter half of winter."
buyers of h/j at 70 certainly hope so anyways.
agree with you that back half of the winter should be strong.
storage boys are withdrawing today and buying that.

would you let me know if confirmation letters have already been sent out for these deals?
"if not, is there any way to get them out before the holiday?"
"the term of the fts-1 agreement is for one day, and automatically renews from day to day."
the discount letter provides that the discount applies to the one-day term and each consecutive one-day term (if any).
the term of the discount letter is typically one month or 3 months.
"the discount letter does not obligate tw to provide service for more than one day, but as long as the term of the service agreement renews, the same discount would apply."
"my point is that if we are already contracting for daily firm this way, it should not matter whether the discount is effective for one month or for 12 months."
"if there is a problem with the current arrangement, we should discuss it."
nothing about the way we do these deals has changed since we discussed it last december.

here's the latest from gregg fyi.
finally!
this deal has been deciphered and changed.
"i killed legs 3 through 7, which were all inadvertantly entered as forwards instead of index forwards."
i checked on the dow jones palo verde index price for those days - 10/3/00 through 10/7/00 - and verified that 5% was greater than $5.00.
"legs 2 and 8 already reflected the 5% offset, not $5, so i didn't change anything on these."
the new leg numbers are 420886.52 through 420886.56.
"if there are any further changes to be made, please let me know."
"otherwise, thank you so much for your patience and cooperation."

"if we get gallup in service may 1, we have a 1 month or greater bust between our in service date and the date the cheap electric rate kicks in."
has courtney got this covered?
i suspect he's been thrashing around so much on locking in the swap that it hasn't been on his radar screen.
i think we should formally notify ecs that we expect them to negotiate a favorable interim power deal to cover the gap between our in service date and the merger closing.
(the difference between the $.
038 and .
"067 rate was about $200,000/ month as i recall, so this is worth some real $$$)  also, we ought to remind courtney that he is still obligated to find a better deal for us if the merger goes south for some reason."
i drafted a letter  awhile back that could be updated for this purpose.
"susan, assuming steve and company agree, could you follow up on this (i'm having martha email it to you)."
the contract requires us to notify ecs by march 1.

how was your holiday?
i thought about you this weekend.
we had fried turkey.
it was sooo yummy.
"i was going to bring you some, but there weren't even crums left."
"well, i just wanted to brag."
so i'll leave you alone.
"by the way, how was your trip to kinder?"
did you have trouble finding the hotel or resturant?
"later, robin"
"okay, i will probably just go down on saturday then since i am allergic to the dogs and i have to be back early sunday for a golf game."
did you hear candy is moving to holland?
she looked great.
i didn't know she was married until i saw her.
she seems happy.
sounds like ben found a good head hunter.
it can be hard to get positive after being in that environment.

here is the analysis that i completed.
let me know if you have questions.

mark we can make this even simpler.
all broker trades are confirmed the next day.
we would only need to record trader deals when they deal direct which is rare and all marketer deals.
if we do this we might consider keeping the tapes for a longer period because only the confirming part would be on tape.
please advise.
we both ran out of gas.
i just happened to be 20 ft from the gas station when i did it.
that was the first time we went by the skydive place.
thanks for the prompt info!!
i hope we can help this guy get his power plant built.

"our own nick stephan is back in h-town for the week and has made a special request for a full-fledged """"steak night"""" (that means good attendance)."

i thought you all might find this an interesting read.
"sorry, the complaint form wasn't very user friendly - i guess the person that designed the form is the same that hired there ticketing help. -e to whom it may concern: i recently returned from a wonderful vacation to telluride."
it was wonderful except for the fact that i traveled on your airline.
i was originally supposed to leave out of iah at 6:05 am on 12/9/00 for phoenix and catch a 10:00 am connection to telluride (the only flight of the day from phoenix to telluride).
"unfortunately, the flight was cancelled due to the re-routing of our plane because of foggy conditions in the houston area."
i do not blame america west for this; it is understandable to cancel this flight because of the danger involved in landing in foggy conditions.
"there is, however, no danger involved in taking off in these conditions, which leads me to the point of this complaint."
your ticketing staff in iah was less than helpful in re-routing us on another airline (continental/united/american had several flights that could have delivered us to phoenix in time to catch our connection) so that we could make our connection.
"instead, we were told that it was impossible to find a flight that could get us to phoenix in time for this connection."
"subsequently, i called other airlines and confirmed space on flights that would have  delivered us to phoenix on time."
it now appears that america west was more willing to sacrifice a day of my vacation rather than pay up to put me on another flight.
"i am extremely disillusioned with the service we received; because we missed our connection we were forced to spend a combined 6 hrs in the phoenix and houston airports and eventually fly into montrose, co where we had to drive 100 miles to telluride."
"instead of arriving in telluride, co at 12pm on 12/9 we arrived at 10pm, a full ten hours later."
this delay caused the waste of one full day of vacation.
myself and members of my group will never fly your airline again because of this experience.

"i thought that was probably a mistake, because you haven't mentioned it and i don't see why you would sell it while you were away."
see ya ben
i'll catch up later.
great--looks like a good start at working through this project.
"i've got a couple of thoughts, questions, etc. that i'd like to discuss with you all before we get back to tino with any kind of preliminary response: 1."
what is our pulse on a project that ramps up slowly to full utilization?
"this deal will not be 100% subscribed for several years (optimistically) as it is designed to gain market share from a combination of market growth and bypass of existing gcnm customers (and new power generation load, but that part of tino's story needs more thinking)."
"the rates on the attached spreadsheet would provide full cost recovery only after the project is fully subscribed, right?"
we need to think about the economics of this thing in terms of deferring and recovering in the out years the revenue shortfalls in the early years.
has gpg ever done deals like that?
2
"on the gcnm discounting issue, it seems we need at least three data points to understand our risks: a.  what do gcnm's current discounts look like?"
b.  how much more aggressively could gcnm discount in the future if they had to to avoid bypass?
"(i.e., are there regulatory or political constraints on increased discounts?) c.   will the big industrial loads stick with the low cost provider if gcnm tries to undercut the project, or will they be willing to pay a little more just to assure that a new pipeline gets built into their backyard?"
3
"assuming we don't have the risk appetite to get in on a project like this, how do we positiion ourselves to be the preferred upstream pipeline for langley's project?"
i assume that if neither tw nor el paso partner with langley he'll interconnect with both.  do we already have or can we create any kind of competitive advantage under that scenario?
4
is the right of way that langley has negotiated really all that valuable?
"from lorraine's memo, it seems that the issue of which route is best is half baked at best."
"if that's all dennis brings to the table (not counting his big bag of $$$$), does a deal with him really make sense?"
"no, but your best friend, ami, will"
how could resist being part of the light brigade?
"hi there, no news here for me, but i thought you might enjoy looking at the second chart."

i would speak to sherriff on that one.
"however, i would caution that real value is created through rapid brownfield development leveraging on enron's development, electricity, coal and emissions talents."
"for comed and homer city, mission has already paid up for these assets based on gas being on the margin."
"now that was before a lot of the run up so it may be worthwhile; however, i think it may be difficult to arb these guys."
"as well, i think it may be difficult to get the asset out of them - i'm not sure that they can turn their strategy or show a loss this quickly from a wall street point of view."
we should probably take a shot at the smaller probably less core virginia assets.
"are they in qf, if so there may be upside in the deal from duran's point of view.."
"dave, given the rise in gas prices and gas being on the margin for a larger part of the load curve, coal assets or coal qf's may be great assets for us from a restructuring and power asset (expansion/brownfield) point of view."

"this thing went from dave and kent's idea to you guys' execution in about two days, even with a (slight) delay due to my panic attack on whether we can make downstream sales."
great job!
"second, i think tk, kevin, maria and glen and i have come up with a workable set of guidelines on when similar deals can be done in the future."
"the key, as i expressed in the attached email, is that the sales be driven by a legitimate operational basis."
"if gas control verifies that we have excess line pack at a location and that making the sale helps get line pack to optimal levels, such sales are appropriate."
gas control should also verify that the operational basis for the sale can be documented if the need ever arises.
today's deal is a great example of that as we actually communicated to outside parties that we anticipated some pressure management issues.
"if there are ever any questions about when such deals are appropriate, or about how to document the operational basis, please give me, susan, or maria a call."

"""hey becky, what's going on?"
things are completely crazy as usual around here.
i need another vacation!
i never told you about my trip did i?
i've told everyone else that stood still for more than 10 seconds.
it was so much fun.
the olympics were so awesome.
i got to see the us women's basketball team play australia for the gold medal.
the crowd was soooo wild...that is until we won.
and i got to see cathy freeman and marion jones run.
the whole first week of my trip was spent at the olympics everyday.
and the second week i spent touring all the beaches that i could find.
"oh, here's a funny story for you."
"okay i'm halfway across the world in a country known for bronze, muscular sufers, right?"
so i take a day cruise around the brisbane waters one day.
these cruises are scheduled everyday and each ship holds about 80-100 people.
as we board the captain tells us that there will be 85 people on the cruise.
here's the fun part....80 of the 85 people were from a wwii veterans reunion!!!
i was on a boat full of grandpa's.
actually it was pretty funny.
this one old man sat next to me and started telling me why they were having the reunion and what thier batallion had done during the war.
then he tells me (keep in mind this man's at least 70) that he was a lifesaver (lifeguard) on one of the local beaches until the year before when an injury forced him to retire!!!
then he starts telling me about the war.
"he said, """"yeah, i was a pow for about 9 days but they weren't feeding me very well so i left."""
"""  he had escaped from a nazi pow camp and fled to greece where he joined the greek reserve forces."
because he fought with greece in the war he's now a greek citizen.
then after the war he and some friends bought a van and traveled all over europe and asia.
when they ran out of money they'd just stop and get jobs until they could save some money and then they'd start again.
i hope one day i have stories even half that interesting!!
but leave it to me to go halfway around the world and hang out with old people!!

aquarius horoscope:    weekly for may 15-21: you're moving away from one base of operations into another.
your priorities and basic requirements are also shifting.
"you find yourself relying less on something you've clung to in the past -- and moving closer to something newer, fresher, and more invigorating."
you've got a rage to live and a burning desire for peak experiences.
middle of the road choices won't do it for you.
your hankering to push the envelope could get you into hot water with the old guard and certain close associates or relatives -- possibly because they're afraid of being replaced.
"but the genie is already out of the bottle, aquarius."
you can't unlearn what you've already tasted.

tim i thought i would give you a simple overview of the gas market.
this may help you prepare for thursday.
everyday roughly 55 billion cubic feet of gas is produced.
"the bulk of this production is in texas, louisiana, and oklahoma."
"in the winter, the us daily load is greater than 55 bcf and in the summer, the daily us load is less than 55 bcf."
"therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal differences in load."
texas and louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.
however these states produce more gas than they consume.
most other states consume more gas than they produce.
therefore pipelines were built to solve the regional imbalances.
most of these pipelines originate out of la and tx and move gas to the areas of greatest demand.
our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if the daily production is growing or shrinking.
"very simplistic, but maybe it helps."

"if in any way we try to change the certificated amount of capacity (firm capacity), we will need to file."
"tw is different than nng, in that tw certificates capacity rather than facilities."
arnold's idea of using a pressure commitment would still require a filing.

"according to this morning's sheet, we are delivering about 11,000 dt to these 4 delivery points."

idle some of our tenn z6 capacity and flow iroquois in to cng.
at today's prices we save: savings tenn variable $.

0672  at  $2.88 ------------ total savings $.
"1151 at these prices, if the tenn z6 and cng pool spread is inside $."
"1100, we should idle tenn capacity and deliver iroq to canajoharie 2."
"buy waddington, get an it discount from wadd to canajoharie."
we save the cng fuel cost.
this usually only works when iroq shows a discounted rate of $.

"of course, the knee questions will be answered the first time applewhite  takes a hit in the fall."

who's the starter going to be =01* applewhite or simms?

"""i saw in the press that n.m. has delayed electric open access until jan 1, 02 for residentials and small commercials and to july 1, 02 for large industrials."

i hope to get votaw on the phone with langley's d.c. govt. contracts lawyers to discuss their theory.
we should be in a better position to raise a flag if the sole source strategy is really a high risk approach.
i'm not sure where that would leave us because the only other approach i can think of is to steer doe into opening the power plant up for bids.
"langley does not appear interested in trying to win an open bid for the power plant, although frankly we would probably have about as good a chance as anyone of winning."
"once we clear up the government contracts issues (if ever) it seems to me that it would be time to expand the team to include federal solutions (potentially, if they see an angle to help them with their kirtland outsourcing strategy) and ena."
the ena involvement would be particularly important so we could get a line of specific turbine availability and the specifications/economics that would result.
"i'm probably engaging in wishful thinking again, but my hope is that the economics on a specific turbine/heat exchanger configuration work out a little better than the generic economics from the model that james ran."
"if we think this thing is a potentially viable deal after i talk to votaw and the langley dc team, we need to grab bill cordes and discuss whether we go to ena """"from the bottom up,"""" or through stan """"from the top down"""" to get hooked into a deal team over there."

how did it go?
"with the change in segmentation rules on transco, it has become much more critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we are buying."
mr. goodell said that tennessee's ebb will indicate if the points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.
"i would prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the delivery points."
i just bought some z6-z6 capacity from penn fuel for the balance of the month.
steve gillespie verified that penn fuel released the primary receipt and delivery point on the contract.
"but, i'm taking penn fuel's word for it and i am unable to verify the information myself."
it could have a big impact on what we flow in z6.
"colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?"
let me know if you need specific capacity examples.

my understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three if indices + .
01 (less transport and fuel) effective november thru february.
the november price would then be $4.4767 + .
01 = $4.4867 less $.
2422 less 0.3% fuel.
the december price would be $5.9967 + .
01 = $6.0067 less $.
2422 less 0.3%

"and craig will join us, i'm sure."

i am not a big fan of this idea even though it is rather interesting.
i just think that the logistics are difficult particularily with employees with families.

we have a 2500 dt/day supply from equitable in tenn z4.
this deal is matched with a term sale to firstenergy (deal 145648 for jan and deal 157848 for feb and mar).
this is a john singer deal.
i have no idea what the price is on the sale to firstenergy.
"""i got a call from tino monaldo today passing on the results of dennis langley's meeting with doe in albuquerque."
"doe indicated that their current pnm rate is """"5.3 cents, exclusive of the demand charge."""
"""  tino's consultant claims that factoring in the demand charge yields an effective rate of approximately 7 cents/kwh."
"assuming we need to come in at 10% less than the current rate, our bogey is 6.3 cents/kwh."
this is at the high end of the range we hoped they'd be in.
"additionally, doe indicated that they need """"redundancy"""" and don't want to rely on pnm for back up power."
"they want a multiple turbine facility--i.e., more smaller turbines instead of fewer large turbines."
the new pipeline will need to be split connected to el paso and tw in order to access diverse supplies and guard against supply failure.
they have not asked for fuel oil backup.
"i know this is starting to look like the project that won't go away, but the power price number looks very promising to me."
i think its worth scrubbing down the model we've used to replace the generic capital cost and o&m assumptions with more specific assumptions related to the specific turbine configuration we'd be using.
"if this price is really as favorable as i think, can we make another run at the ena people and federal solutions guys to see if they have any interest?"

frank: one of the most likely scenarios for a var blowout would be a severe cold front hitting the country in the middle to latter part of the winter.
"in such a circumstance, cash may separate from prompt futures similar to how midwest power traded $5000+ on specific days last year while prompt futures were $200."
"the correlation between prompt and cash is normally very strong, and is indicated by the small var associated with a spread position currently."
but in the winter that may change.
another thing to keep in mind while developing this scenario is the assymetric risk presented by having a spread position on.
"assuming we enter the winter with normal to below normal storage levels, a position of long cash, short prompt futures has a long tail only on the positive p&l side."
"while such a trade in an efficient market has expected payout of 0, the payout probabilities may look like the following: 20%  $ -."

"to give you more clarity, stephen transferred to ebs effective july 1, 2000."
"his move to ebs was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it would be effective upon the completion of the sap implementation for ena on july 1."
"stephen was playing a critical role in ena to insure a smooth transition for sap, and todd lindholm at ebs was in agreement that stephen would remain an ena employee through implementation, with his performance review being based on his work for ena."
stephen is very talented and will no doubt do a great job at ebs.
"during the first 6 months of 2000, however, his heart was already at ebs and he failed to communicate with my other direct reports on sap issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our other key sap expert to ebs without a back-up plan for ena, etc.  it was his failure to make his sap assignment a priority that landed him in the needs improvement category relative to other directors on my team."
"it is the r elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that category."

"""hey em, first things first, i got the personality test...very interesting."
i took it twice.
the first time i was a mastermind (like katy) and the second i was a mentor (like matt)  i think i only changed two answers between the first and second test.
"anyway, definitely a fun little intro to a rather boring monday morning."
i was trying to remember where we left on in the saga of ted noble.
i guess the last time i had emailed you ted had to spend the night at darren's apartment because he'd left his keys in his locker at the met.
"well, if you'll remember at the end of the email he said he'd talk to me later, which is extremely relevant considering he was supposed to tell me whether we could go get a drink that night or not."
"i knew he had his presentation that day so i figured he'd call later that afternoon to tell me yeah or neah...i received no call, no email, no nothing."
"of course, always wanting to give others the benefit of the doubt i figured the presentation must have taken longer than expected and afterward he'd decided to just go to austin and pick up his friend from the airport."
"if that were the case, knowing ted, i thought he must have just forgotten that he'd told me he'd call."
wrong!!!!
"friday at work i had to go down to his floor (for legitimate reasons i swear) and he was there, the jerk."
he didn't see me though nor did he try communicate with me at all that day.
flash forward to the next week.
i didn't get back to the office until wednesday because i was in austin tuesday for a recruiting trip.
when i got in i of course immediately checked my email...nothing.
i also didn't have any messages at any of the 3 phones i can be reached through.
"so it's now thursday afternoon, still no interaction...i am pissed."
about 2:00 p.m. he calls.
he asks me about san diego and i ask him about austin...both trips were great.
we discuss ucla and ut football for  a while...i of course get riled up.
"he informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for enron."
while he is very excited about trading i get the impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his vacation time.
he said that he and darren had been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week had pretty much just been one long string of meetings.
"it is around this point that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed."
"as a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home asap, i.e. """"i'm leaving tomorrow (friday) to go to california for a week."""
"""  i make sure i heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and  1 whole week (7 days) and at no point did he ask to get together before he left."
"so, that was thursday."
"i'm down on his floor again on friday to talk to my old group and, to my dismay, run in to him."
"we exchange pleasantries, i ask him when he's leaving, he informs me he is going to sleep for the entire week in an attempt to catch-up, i tell him to have fun and that's that."
"so here we are, or rather here i am in houston...alone."
any thoughts?
"on a brighter note, tell katy i think i'm going to try and come oct 4 - oct 9 so that i can see both of you."
"also, i understand your dilemma regarding claudia, but i definitely don't think you should look a gift horse in the mouth (if you know what i mean)."
that first month after katy leaves is going to be awkward so it's best to have someone there even if only to act as a crutch until you find your footing.
i'm sure monique can testify to a little extra weight dealing with me since you and matt both took off.
"and speaking of matt, no i haven't heard a thing from the turn-coat."
i need to shoot him an email and see how things are shaping up for him.
i'm willing to bet though that moving to austin hasn't solved all of his problems...just transplanted to a prettier location.
get back to me with anything...i'm desperate for positive energy.
"oh, and i'm going to try to meet with that director friend of mine this week to talk about swinging a rotation in london (he has 75 employees over there that work for him right now), and i'm going to set up a meeting with the lady in charge of my rotations within the analyst program to make sure i'm doing everything i can to get over there and still get promoted."
"talk to you soon, susan ******** humor is the best medicine."

why exercise???
1) my grandmother started walking five miles a day when she was 60.
she's 97 now & we don't know where the hell she is.
2) the only reason i would take up jogging is so that i could hear heavy breathing again.
"3) i joined a health club last year, spent about 400 bucks."
haven't lost a pound.
apparently you have to show up.
4) i have to exercise in the morning before my brain figures out what i'm doing.
5) i don't exercise at all.
"if god meant us to touch our toes, he would have put them further up our body."
"6) i like long walks, especially when they are taken by people who annoy me."
"7) i have flabby thighs, but fortunately my stomach covers them."
8) the advantage of exercising every day is that you die healthier.
"9) if you are going to try cross-country skiing, start with a small country."
10) i don't jog.

"ken, in response to your note, i am not aware of any official dialogue with mr. kase lawal about a potential sale of mariner or with the economics of the aborted ipo."
his $250 m valuation may have been appropriate 12 to 18 months ago.
"however, mariner has enjoyed a series of successful wells that are expected to be booked in reserve reports next march not to mention significant increases in gas and oil prices."
"our current valuations, in the $600m range is a stretch target but not incredibly out of line given reserve growth and current energy prices."
"our current goal, is to be able to demonstrate three to four quarters of increasing operating cashflow and reserves growth before attempting a private sale mid next year to a significant e&p concern that desires an offshore division."
"the concentration, operating and exploration risk implicit in mariner make it a very poor ipo candidate ((ie) i'm not sure that an ipo was ever a viable strategy to maximize the exit value)."
i would recommend that we not meet to make the following points: a) mariner is not on the market at this point in time and b)  his un-solicited offer does not warrant serious attention.
"otherwise, we would be glad to speak to him in the future if we decide to sell tha asset."
i hope this meets with your approval.

thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the global operations controller forum.
there will be approximately 30 enron business controllers present at the meeting.
"all have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following enron entities:  enron north america, enron europe, enron south america, enron global markets, enron industrial markets, enron broadband services and enron energy services."
"attendees will be here from houston, calgary, tokyo, sydney, london and new york (metals business-maybe!)."
attached for your reference is the agenda.
"there may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group."
"you are scheduled to address the group as follows: date:  monday, october 23, 2000 time:  3:30 pm place:  the warwick hotel the versailles room - 12th floor 5701 main street houston,  tx  77005 i have noted that your topic will be assessing, measuring and managing market risk."
any references that you could make to the importance of information flow between rac and operations would be great to cover.
feel free to offer up a challenge to the group.
i hope that you will be able to join us for the tour of enron field and for dinner at ruggles center field terrace on monday evening.

"anyway, i have a couple of questions for you."
is there anything special you'd like me to bring over (that your mom isn't getting for you).
i talked to your mom yesterday and she mentioned a craving for turkey jerky.
if you want me to bring some over just let me know where to buy it.
"also, do you have any predictions for the weather."
"i'm planning on bringing the following - jeans, sweatshirt, black pants & skirt, black cardigan, """"rain coat"""" (i put it in quotes b/c i know mine won't be official), some """"go out"""" close, running shoes, heels, and boots, 2 sweaters, varying tops, and a pair of shorts."
"i always end up over-packing, but i'm really going to try to pare down."
i'm assuming you have a blow-dryer so i can leave mine at home.
"i talked to darren today and he said friday sounded good...and, i sent an email to nick so hopefully it will work for him as well."
i also emailed jessica's friend ashley who's living over there and she wanted to get together maybe for lunch or something over the weekend.
i've been checking out the tube maps on the web and don't think i should have much of a problem getting to your place.
i assume i'm going to want to get off at the holland park tube stop.
"should be a piece of cake, right?"
any bright ideas of how to get your extra set of keys to me friday morning?

"""i read wednesday's ngpl order (rp00-18-002) as applying only to ngpl due to their unique restrictions and tariff rules."
"i do not read it as forcing the rest of the industry (i.e., us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids."
i think we can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ena deal based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index mechanism.
"i.e., on that type of deal, we can determine that the index mechanism is worth """"x cents"""" to us and require a discounted recourse rate bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win."
agreed?
"note that ngpl whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i.e., us) on this issue."

"as a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly """"accrual value"""" can be determined."
"this analysis has resulted in the realization that the wellhead potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month."
"the main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from mtm because of accrual costs."
"of the above, greg sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked."
tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).

this is made possible by new ftrs that chris mallory scheduled on the sp/nob path.
as a result of having firm transmission rights if the iso calls and cuts one of our schedules at nob we need to make sure  and ask the iso that the other nonfirm  schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut.

hi mum!
the trip was pretty exhausting.
"friday we saw hoover dam, had lunch at a great diner in kingman (on route 66!) and rolled into sedona around 5."
"climbed around the red rocks of sedona all day on saturday, sat by the pool in the afternoon and i did some shopping."
sunday we drove to grand canyon and did part of the bright angel trail.
that was pretty strenuous but definitely worth it.
wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had bill's trial schedule to deal with.
i'll spare you the details of my trip home -- suffice it to say i didn't make it back to houston until about noon yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.
i will definitely come to austin next weekend but probably will not get in until later on saturday.

you guys probably don't remember this (i didn't until i checked the file) but there were a couple of exhibits to the transwestern gallup contracts that we left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.
my recollection is that we were in such a hurry to get the compression service agreement signed and sent to ferc that we left a couple of these things to do later.
"now that we have the ferc order, i want to get these contracts off my desk and off to corporate records or whereever original contracts go to die."

completed an it agreement with cima energy.
volume is 5000/day production on the crawford lateral (#500267).
gas will be transported to both the willi wick farm tap (#12510) in the texas panhandle area as well as to the west texas pool (#58646).
"the agreement is at 0.065 cents, plus fuel for 14 months beginning sept 2000."
"mac, thanks for the research report on eog."
"here are my observations: gas sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year estimated gas prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising."
"recalc of eps with more accurate gas prices: (334,340,000 mct x $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional eps x 12 p/e multiple = $34 a share that is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices."
i think crude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.
current price 37 nat.

"scott, as i preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by deffner's group, although it is based on language they have seen before."
"it was my understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later."
"we can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  i am happy to access the resources in their group, however."
fce hasn't seen any of this language.
it was something i pulled together for you to look at.
"as for fce's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, i think the language is too broad."
"in fact, i think assignment by them should require our consent."
"otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing facilities, etc.  if they are going to merge with another company or sell their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something peculiar in conn. law."
they only need assignment language for an asset sale.

what we have tried to do to meet your concerns is to see that abb has a contract with a party which is as financially sound as enron by adding the guaranty language.
"this addresses abb's request that the party with the payment obligation have the """"financial wherewithall"""" to make the payments."

"please tell me if you have these in the ft file, i have already checked jim's intra physical and financial files for ontario and came up empty."

here's the latest from ge.
"when i spoke to rob stevens, he had a question about whether mitsui needed to review the final drafts of the ge agreements."
i don't know the resolution of that issue.
"as you know, the current arrangement with ge requires payment within 3 days of signing of the contracts, which means we have to be prepared to assign the contract, then wire the money from eeim to mitsui immediately so that mitsui can pay ge, and ge can refund ena."
has eeim been funded yet and has mitsui bought in on the payment plan?

i am still billing ces for the union camp capacity and it was terminated effective 3/31/2000.
"the net impact is $64,104.00 that needs to be credited back to ces."

"jeff, the new transport demand charges plus the scheuduling fee of $20,000.00 equals $1,865,705.00."

hi!
how are you?
i wanted to call you this week-end but i had such a bad one that i never had time.
"first, i made a mistake at work that caused several people to have to work extra time on saturday so i was on the phone with them all day ( i felt bad)."
sunday we went to brunch at pappasitos and i left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.00 to replace - i was so mad at myself (you know how cheap i am).
i was off monday & tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.
i finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and my halloween decorations that mom made me up.
my house looks really nice (to nice for us actually).
we finally got our chandelier for the dining room - it is so beautiful.
i made reservations for thankgiving and was sad when don told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because lynn has to work.
i hope we can stay with you as i understand carla & russ are not doing well.
maybe we can eat at the rose - just  you & me.
well better go.
love you and take care of yourself.

"they are on the west side of the building, just outside my office."
"while room for this scheduling team was not available on the 31st floor, this move was made to improve communications with the texas desk traders."
"by being within the same elevator bank, we can now employ """"squawk"""" boxes between the traders and this scheduling team."

"""i recall that we set up a warning flag approach with market services last year to make sure that sempra never """"goes physical"""" without us manning the battle stations and deciding what to do.  do you guys know who the noms would come in to in market services if sempra ever decided to try to take their gas out of cunningham and move it off system?"
"care to venture a guess as to what that person would do if a 100,000 nom by sempra into an it contract for a haul from the cunningham storage point to demarc hit their desk?"
"sempra couldn't nom the gas into a transport contract without first giving kent/sue/morgan a physical delivery nom under the sf agreement, correct?"
"at which point we would immediately nom the sba, correct?"
these issues may be important to our closing this year's deal if tcem can't come up with the corp. guarantee.

"john, i took the volumes on deal 226556 to 0 for the term of the deal starting june 1."
this is the purchase from belden & blake behind nyseg.
i changed the volume on deal 226563 from 1 dth/day to 1500 dth/day.
this is the purchase from statoil at cpa.
the price on this deal is nx1 + .
434 and the price on john's worksheet is nx1 + .
54 (per mcf).
"john, is this price adjusted for dth??"
"i created deal 280185, purchase from statoil, volume of 333 day, the price is nx1+ $."
56 per mcf.
this is a purchase of local production behind the citygate.
"david, this deal probably needs to be hedged in sitara."
cindy - deal 226563 is a purchase from ces - statoil energy.
i set up deal 280185 with the same counterparty.
this deal should have been in the system effective 1/1/2000.
"according to elizabeth, we should not use the ces - statoil energy."
"it doesn't matter to me how its set up, however, this deal should have been in the system from jan and it is the same type of deal as deal 226563."
i changed the volume on deal 226747 from 1 dth to 1100 dth/day.
this is a purchase from questar and it is also local production behind cpa.
"john, there are 3 deals for questar, the other 2 deals have volumes of 0 right now."
can you tell me how the volume should be split out for pricing purposes?
cool!

it would be helpful for us (the overall power business) to have a common set of metrics and reports that evaluate the effectiveness and importance of the mid market effort.
i think we all believe this is an important skill or capability that needs to measured and rewarded. key metrics may include: a)coverage metrics against target customers (ie) customer contact ;b) forward deal flow or hot list; c)completed transactions and origination; and d) eol customer sign-ons and deal flow.

"""per louie soldano, i called dave sinclair (gpg row) about whether we have any ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the bnsf railroad."
"in dave's experience, that is a nonstarter."
"apparently, a bunch of utilities, including us through dave, have even formed a coalition to try to figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative."
if the rr owns its row outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be able to condemn an easement by getting a ferc certificate.
"in other words, the rr would be treated just like any other landowner."
"if we did that, dave thinks bnsf would treat it as a declaration of war."
"since our lines cross or parallel bnsf right of way all over the place from topock to duluth, that would be foolish."
i swore sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world i was interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private row without too much pain.
"if the rr option doesn't pan out, we may want to suggest to tino and dennis that our row people can handle this."
"assuming we can't come up with some magic contact with the rr, i propose that, at the appropriate time,  we tell dennis and tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of row should be flagged as a potential problem that enron can help resolve once we decide to go forward."
"other than the bnsf issue, i don't think we have any specific """"to dos"""" or any specific comeback date to dennis and tino."

a couple more thoughts.
certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to switching and slowdown in economy.  big 3 automakers all temporarily closing plants for instance.
switching is significant and has led to cash in the gulf expiring weak everyday.
gas daily spread to prompt trading at $1....need some very cold weather to justify that.
this seems to be the test of the next 3-5 days.
will the switching/loss of demand/storage management keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+.
not too many years ago we had a $50 print on the hub.
"unless we get some crazy prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market."
funny watching the flies in the front.
bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.
50 friday morning.
probably worth 1.30 now.
crazy.
people have seen each front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h. what's the thoughts on distillates...  is it tight enough such that gas switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up or is the market too oversupplied to care?

we were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for november.
i think our contract for november is at the average of the inside ferc postings for the three pipes plus a penny.
those prices are as follows: transco zone 3  $4.51 florida zone 3    $4.45 sonat                      $4.47 avg                        $4.4767  +  0.01 = $4.4867 the same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted from this price.
i think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu.
"also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per rebel's directions."
ena will have to cash out the difference with destin (at higher prices!

"i'm al gore, and i'd like to tell you about myself."
"i know a lot about hardship, because i came into this world as a poor black child in a tiny town in the backwoods of tennessee."
i was born in a log cabin that i built with my own hands.
i taught myself to read by candlelight and helped support my 16 brothers and sisters by working summers as a deck hand on a mississippi river steamboat.
"my mother taught me the value of education, so every day i would walk 5 miles to a one-room schoolhouse."
"i was a mischievous, fun-loving scamp, thought i never dreamed that one-day, my youthful escapades would serve as the inspiration for """"huckleberry finn."""
""" back then, black folks in the south were second-class citizens."
"one day, a traveling minister came through town, and i asked him if anyone was ever going to do something to guarantee civil rights for all americans."
"well, i guess i made an impression."
"you see, the minister's name was martin luther king, jr. my father was a united states senator."
"he once perched me on his knee and said, """"son, if you work hard and listen to your mama, someday you can live in a hotel in washington, d.c., and go to an exclusive prep school."""
""" but life of privilege was not for me."
"after getting my high school diploma, i took a job in a hot, dirty textile mill."
i was so appalled at the treatment of the workers there that i organized a union.
"later, that experience inspired a movie - which is why, to this day, my close friends at the afl-cio call me """"norma rae."""
""" when word got out what an 18 year old factory worker had done, harvard called and offered me a scholarship."
"i captained the hockey team to four consecutive national championships, but i also played football and was good enough to win the heisman trophy."
"during my college years, i lived in a housing project and moonlighted playing lead guitar for a little rock band."
you may have heard of it -- the rolling stones.
"but there was a war going on, and i felt i had to serve my country."
so i enlisted in the u.  s.  army and went to vietnam.
"i was deeply opposed to the war, but i did my duty as a soldier and came back home with the medal of honor and the croix de guerre."
"when i got back, i took a long journey across this great land of ours."
"i've crossed the deserts bare, man, i've breathed the mountain air, man, i've traveled, i've done my share, man, i've been everywhere."
"and the people i met at truckstops and campgrounds and homeless shelters on that journey all said the same thing: """"al, we need you in washington."""
""" i knew they were right, but first i had to take care of some other business---building the world trade center, founding the audubon society, doing the clinical research that proved smoking caused cancer, and coming up with the recipe for mrs.  field's chocolate chip cookies."
"finally, i deferred to the demands of the people of tennessee and allowed them to elect me to the house of representatives and the senate, where i established the us strategic oil reserve."
"and then one winter day nearly nine years ago, for no particular reason, i answered the call of the people once again and took the oath of office as vice president of the united states."
"since then, i've been part of the most successful administration in american history."
"and, in my spare time, i invented the internet."
many times bill clinton has been pondering some grave decision and has asked me what to do.
"and when i would give him my thoughts, he would invariable say, """"of course."
that's brilliant.
why didn't i think of that?
""""" during the darkest days of the impeachment battle, the president told me he only wished he had listened when i told him to stay away form that dark-haired intern."
"so after i decided to run for president, i sat down with him and asked if he had any suggestions about how to conduct my campaign."
and bill clinton gave me a few simple words of advice -- words i'll never forget.
"he looked me in the eye and he said, """"al, just tell the truth, it's always worked for me."""
""""""
i'm going to give it a look and see what open issues we might have.
just give me a call when you want to go!

great expectations forbes - 10/16/2000 by lynn cook copyright 2000 forbes inc.
enron investment partners' biggest gamble to date has been the $4 million it pumped into cynet.
"the software outfit relies on a wireless modem that plugs in to a laptop or pc and lets you e-mail, fax, and use voice-and data-messaging."
that may not sound like much.
but imagine e-mailing thousands of people at once--or sending a document and following with a prerecorded message to tell folks to check their fax machines.
cynet is also developing the ability to retrieve e-mail messages as voice mail on a laptop and to translate voice mail into e-mail.
the investment helped launch cynet as the first african-american company to go public out of houston.
how's it doing?
not so hot.
"after the initial offering in january the stock jumped to $8, but it got pummeled in april and now hovers around $1."
it has yet to recover.
"still, enron is holding on to its investment, now worth only $1.9 million."
cynet holds the exclusive north american marketing license for teleran electronic's wireless modems.
that's got to be worth something.
compaq computer is using the technology to add high-speed wireless internet connections to its ipaq pocket.
"john, you should have received a copy of the e-mail you sent to jeff, which i in turn forwarded to greg whalley."
"to bring you up to speed - greg whalley is the chairman & ceo of enron net works - enrononline and all it resides in this business unit (in some of the e-mails in the string you sent me, jay fitzgerald and jenny rub were mentioned - they both report to greg)."
"if you don't hear from him within a reasonable amount of time, please let me know."

i didn't get back from the meeting with causey and buy until just before 6:00 today - not that the meeting was long - rick causey was just running late so we cooled our heels outside his office for quite a while before getting started.

enjoy your time off tomorrow and on monday.
"my plans are to take off next week, and to be back in the office to work the week between christmas and new years."

"you get an education in psychology, nursing, criminal justice, communications and human sexuality no college can match."
"in the eyes of a child, you rank right up there with god."
"you have the power to heal a boo-boo, scare away monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart, police a slumber party, ground them forever and love them without limits, so one day they will, like you, love without counting the cost."""

"""russell: i think i should give you a little background on small ventures."
bill perkins and i have a strong personal and professional relationship.
he is an extremely creative individual.
"whalley actually commented on him today as someone """"who thinks outside the box""""."
bill actually sat in a bar four years and said the next tradeable market would be bandwidth.
he has been successful in the gas business when he has had someone to filter his ideas.
as such he provides an informal consulting role to enron.
"he throws out ideas and, every once in a while, he comes up with a great one."
"he pointed out an anomalous pricing occurence in the options market, a market i normally don't follow closely, that i translated into a multimillion dollar trade for enron."
"in return, i have agreed to have enron intermediate his trades within reason."
i want to emphasize that continuing this relationship should be considered a high priority.
i am willing to accept some of the credit risk exposure as a cost of doing business.
bill understands his role as an independent in the market and performs the right risk/reward trades for someone with finite capital.
i place very high confidence in bill not conducting high risk trades.
"having said that, we certainly need to monitor his credit exposure and continue to require lc's."
just understand that he is at a different level of sophistication that any other non-investment grade counterparty.
i understand there was some concern in regards to the transco z6 spread option he traded.
"he was absolutely right about the valuation and we, on the trading desk, knew it as well."
there are a couple isolated products that enron does not do a good job of valuing because of systems limtations.
this was one product.
our spread options are booked in excel using option pricing models created by the research group.
the problem with these models is that they are strictly theoretical and don't take into account gas fundamental price limitations.
"for instance, it is less probable, though not impossible, for a transport spread from a production area to a market area to go within variable cost than the models predict."
thus it is necessary to apply a correlation skew curve on top of the overlying correlation used.
"obviously, we have this function in our pricing models."
i was not aware this methodology had not been transferred to the valuation models.
this has since been changed.
fortunately these incidents tend to be extremely rare as very few non-investment grade companies trade these types of products.
"finally, on friday bill wanted to do a trade that reduced his exposure to enron."
i gave mike maggi the go ahead to do the trade without consulting credit.
i do not believe that i acted out of line in approving this trade considering the circumstances.
"if you believe differently, please advise."
"thanks, john"""
i promise i didn't forget about you tonight!

"""on thursday last week the commission eliminated the old """"texas eastern"""" rule that required pipelines to obtain prior ferc approval before contracting for transportation and storage capacity on upstream or downstream pipelines."
the new rule allows pipelines to acquire and use such capacity without going to ferc first.
"the rule does reiterate that bundled sales of gas are still prohibited, and further provides that the acquiring pipeline will be financially at risk for the costs of the acquired capacity."
"interestingly, the acquiring pipeline apparently has the option of selling the acquired capacity under its own rate schedules or of releasing the capacity pursuant to its capacity release program."
the order is silent on whether the price cap applies to short term releases of acquired capacity.
"while we are still reviewing the order and may provide additional guidance at  a later time, i'd emphasize for now that our normal contract approval procedures and authority thresholds should be deemed to apply to capacity contracts."
"for example, the """"approval authorization for cash expenditures"""" dated feb. 3, 2000 provides dave and steve with authority up to $250,000 on operating expense obligations."

can we meet on friday and review this spreadsheet?
hunter
currently there are no bids ( scott and i will get with dick this afternoon).
it is his job to talk.
he can't help himself.
i think that's enough stuff for now.
"""thanks for the extremely helpful analysis steve and john."
i'm getting a pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently configured.
"just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of observations for the group to react to, along the lines of steve's """"however"""" section of his memo: 1."
running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.
the fuel cost is a killer.
"however, i keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 corners spot price someone mentioned on the phone."
is there enough volatility at 4 corners to support a peaking merchant plant?
"how often are those types of opportunities available, and could a power plant in alb. capture that upside by transporting power to 4 corners over pnms system?"
2
we have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.
someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the doe/dod electric load at kirtland had a fairly high load factor.
"i think we have all assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell surplus power into the grid (either at 4 corners or, after n.m. elec. restructuring, into the alb. area)."
"i just found the numbers i was remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual 1998 consumption was 334.5 million kwh."
"by my lawyer-math, that is about a 60% load factor for doe."
"if the doe load is only 60% l.f., and the plant only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that arise when the market clearing price at 4 corners or in albuquerque exceeds some benchmark rate ($."
05/kwh?
$.
10/kwh?
higher?)  the plant might run at a 30-40% load factor on an annual basis.
the question is can we reduce the capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?
3
"could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., doe) but sold the rest of its output into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?"
4
if the answer to 3.
"is no, would ena backstop the debt financing by signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what the government needs?"
at what price?

brenda herod is the operations controller for eim.
"(brenda and brent in their roles over eim and egm, respectively, are both direct reports of mine.)  brenda is out of the country through the end of this week on vacation, touring europe with her mom."
"if there is a need to address this issue this week, let me know and i can start down that road until brenda returns."
let me know.
i did hear an unsubstantiated rumor this week that clickpaper.com is set to go live in london within 5 days.
i am trying to find out if that is true.
"if it is, it would be a repeat of a commercial decision in houston to do so this past july without letting anyone in the mid and back office know."
we had to scramble to set up an infrastructure to support that in a big hurry.
not ideal.
i hope that history has not repeated itself.
let me know if you have heard anything on this.
i will try and get back with you today.
the position will actually report to me.
you can change it.

adam: hope your interview goes well.
"things are going crazy in the gas market so, unfotunately, i'm stuck at my desk and can't go up for interviews."
"as far as the interview goes, my advise would be the same as any interview."
be confident.
answer the question asked.
don't be afraid to say you don't know but don't make excuses.
express interest in why you find enron appealing compared to the other 100 companies interviewing.
the trading training program is still in the works.
few people outside the trading area are even aware of its existence at this point so i wouldn't ask any questions about it in the interviews.
"if you receive an offer, it would probably be for a normal analyst position with the opportunity to enter the training program when you arrive."
not sure about that last statement though.
the training program is geared towards our two most mature and pure trading business areas: gas and power.
there are still a large number of other trading spots in our developing commodities side that would not fall under the program.
that's a function of the program being developed by the head of these two businesses.
not ready to take it corporate-wide yet.
write me about how your interviews went.
good luck:

"even though i know how difficult this disease can be to manage with the multiple finger pricks for blood samples and several shots each day, i cannot imagine how difficult it is for a small child with this disease."
taking insulin does not cure the disease nor prevent the development of complications; insulin is simply their life support system and without it they would die.

jdf is a very efficient organization in which approximately 84% of all money raised goes directly to research.

gore says there is too much bush.
i agree with most of this but have found from experience that if you give originators the freedom to pursue deals with little restrictions the deal flow improves dramatically.
"for eott, we want to pursue acquisitions of energy assets period.."
we do not need to limit ourselves to the crude oil business.
in fact a portfolio of assets would likely reduce the companies overall risk to crude prices.
"second, we want to avoid any additional exposure to commodity prices."
"therefore, fee based business structures are the best fit."
"that would include pipeline acquisitions (crude, liquid, natural gas, co2, etc) as well as fee based processing."
non-qualified income based aquisitions are also ok as long as they are fee based-type deals 9ie..
electric generation).
"terminals are also an excellent acquistion for mlp,s. does this get to your issues?"
thanks
hi!

"wade, thanks for the email and invitation."
you never know when i may show up!
i look forward to learning more about this and how our groups work together.
is john's group doing a good job for you?
tony wow i don't think so.
i thought i would rewrite yours and correct some of the factual errors.
if you disagree please write me back.
i moved from our houston office in 1994 to calgary and in 1999 was named president of the canadian operation.
we went from a small gas marketing shop to the dominant natural gas trader and originator in canada.
it was absolutely awesome.
i had the time of my life.
we built the business with very little supervision from houston into a major contributor to enron corp's bottom line.
"these days, as many people know, we are using the same trading and risk management skills that we learned in the energy business to create liquid tradable markets in bandwidth, pulp and paper, coal, and many others."
so our newer people still have the chance to do what i did in canada and help build revolutionary new businesses.
what a lot of people don't realize is how dominant our trading and risk management presence is in natural gas and power.
the opportunities our outstanding and the challenges will test the best minds out there.
these businesses are interesting and very complicated with a million different variables to figure out ranging from the weather to the levels of gas storage in montana to how to move power from new york to south caralina.
you can't put gas and power on a truck or store them in a warehouse like other commodities.
"its not like trading bonds, where you sit around and try to figure out what the fed is going to do."
"it has much more complexity, and if you like trying to solve complex problems and your good at it.....get down here! .... we need you!"
john's callout quote enron's not a place where you can hide.
if you can't get it done you won't fit in.
"but if you can, and you work hard, you'll get noticed, you'll excell, you'll get paid, and we're going to love you."
this is what i mean aout miscommunication.
"brian, we have  a deal we can't identify.  do you show anything in your records about purchasing 3,575 dt's on jan 20th or 21st?"
it looks like a 1 day deal and we bought the gas delivered from cgas of ohio.
the delivery point in our system is 23n but that may be wrong.
the price would be somewhere around $16.00.

"maria friend when you receive this, say a prayer."
that's all you have to do.
there is nothing attached.
this is powerful.
"just send this to four people and do not break this, please."
prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive.
there is no cost but a lot of rewards.
let's continue praying for one another.
"father, i ask you to bless my friends reading this right now lord, show them a new revelation of your love and power."
"holy spirit, i ask you to minister to their spirit at this very moment."
"where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy."
"where there is self-doubting, release a renewed confidence in your ability to work through them."
"where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, i ask you to give them understanding, patience, and strength as they learn submission to your leading."
"where there is spiritual stagnation, i ask you to renew them by revealing your nearness, and by drawing them into greater intimacy with you."
"where there is fear, reveal your love, and release to them your courage."
"where there is a sin blocking them, reveal it, and break its hold over my friend's life."
"bless their finances, give them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends to support, and encourage them."
"give each of them discernment to recognize the demonic forces around them, and reveal to them the power they have in you to defeat it."
i ask you to do these things in jesus' name.
"in christian love, your friend in jesus."
passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
passing this on to one not considered a friend is something i know christ would do.

hi rhonda - i was told you're the person to contact regarding changes in the enpower counterparty list.
"several items are outdated or have gone through many different versions, and it's made somewhat of a confusing situation for the traders and others who do deal entry."
"my sensitivity to this is heightened because i'm new to the deal control position here at the portland west desk, and i'm still getting used to which names we use and which we don't."
"monica lande suggested i ask you about it, although she pointed out that if we've ever booked a deal under any of these counterparty names, then they need to stay in the system."
i'm wondering if there is any way to weed out some of those extra selections.
"for example, duke and el paso both have five different names in the system; arizona public service company has become pinnacle; and other names were just tests that are no longer used."
"please let me know whenever you have a free moment - this is certainly not an urgent request, and i completely understand if the list needs to stay as is."
just checking.
"thanks, kate"
"dear dan, thank you for contacting me, but i am quite content with my current opportunities at enron."

"""the commercial group asked several weeks ago whether they can enter into discount letters applicable to daily firm for as long as one year."
"the standard wording of the discount letter applicable to daily firm is such that the discount is effective for as many one-day terms as the fts-1 agreement renews, but not beyond a specified date."
typically tw enters into these discount letters for a term of one month.
the marketers say that they were once told that they could not make such a discount applicable for longer than a 3-month term.
i see no basis for this limitation.
"the term of the fts-1 agreement is one day, renewable from day to day."
the discount is only applicable for so long as the fts-1 agreement renews.
"if the fts-1 agreement does not renew, the discount is no longer applicable."
the basis for the shipper's transportation rights is the fts-1 agreement.
"we are not guaranteeing a shipper """"daily"""" firm for longer than a one-day term."
"the discount letter merely states that, for so long as the fts-1 agreement renews, a particular discount applies, up to a certain cutoff date."
does this make sense?

what's the word mr. goodell?
ecar there was plenty of generation online for sat. and sun.  fe offered out 150 mw's at $38 for a 16-hr. schedule for monday.
no one had any interest at this price level.
there were no decent bids for saturday or sunday.
on saturday we moved  ecar power down to florida most of the day until tlr's were called.
"on sunday during the evening peak soco was on the bid($25), unfortunately tlr's prevented any energy from moving into serc."
most utilities will be sellers in the morning.
ecar   fri 16 hour average:  bid  $ 25.6   offer $ 27.5 sat 16 hour average:  bid  $ 10.5   offer $ 26.9 sun 16 hour average:  bid  $  9.9  offer $ 17.2 main tlr's were abundant over the weekend.
"ce, ameren and other main members were not able to send power into serc or frcc."
no legitimate bids while sellers had plenty of power.
ameren was an island due to tlr's.
ce will be selling hourly all day monday.
"ce quoted an offer of $36 for a 16-hr schedule, for he 7 they quoted $12, with no bids to move it to."

he also promised doe a 10 % power cost reduction (before he even knew what they were currently paying).
he may have made some promises that are pretty to hard to deliver on.

how do we get the right focus on support for calgary?
"mark taylor wanted to hold up transferring confirm responsibility to calgary, so we still need to provide excellent service to them."
"while i can appreciate that diane is out, that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the calgary stuff."
"every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand how mistakes continue to happen."
"while i know that they can't appreciate the vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still need to be able to deliver top notch service."
"unfortunately, we stub our toe enough with calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers pretty poor to average service."
that is a terrible internal pr issue.
let's put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings with calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service.
i am copying susan because she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  rob milnthorp (president of enron canada).
"she responded to rob quickly and handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with you at the time."
"but now we need to look at all of our outstanding, potential or past issues with calgary and get a solution in place."
she can fill you in on the details in that situation.
susan:  do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with calgary?
"you have the list that gregg prepared on commercial/legal to do's, and he and i will work on those things next week."

"""02:03:48 pm<br>july 21, 2000 to: all operators, producers, shippers and customers on the transcontinental gas pipe line system (transco) re: modifications to capacity release processes and segmentation and order 637 compliance filings on june 30, 2000 transco made a compliance filing with the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc), in docket no. rp00-17-000."
"this filing proposed several changes to the capacity release and capacity segmentation procedures that are to become effective for business beginning gas day september 1, 2000."
there are two key elements to the proposed changes in docket rp00-17-000: 1.
"use of """"master"""" ft-r commodity contracts transco will no longer use the """"master"""" commodity form of service agreement for reservation rate capacity releases."
"historically, transco has required capacity release shippers to execute two ft-r contracts upon their initial acquisition of released capacity: the ft-r demand contract and the ft-r """"master"""" commodity contract."
"with subsequent reservation rate releases, shippers were only required to execute new ft-r demand contracts."
"each ft-r demand contract was specific to a capacity release deal and the ft-r """"master"""" commodity contract was used for all nomination and commodity billing purposes."
"effective with business for gas day september 1, 2000, transco will require shippers acquiring capacity through reservation rate capacity releases to execute and nominate transportation on each new ft-r demand contract."
this will require new activities to be created for each capacity release contract.
"for any capacity release deals that span the august 31 - september 1 period, nominations for gas day august 31, 2000 will be on the existing """"master"""" commodity contract and nominations for gas day september 1, 2000 will be new transactions on the ft-r demand contract."
"additionally, all commodity billing will be done on the ft-r demand contract."
"transco will send a """"notice of termination"""" to all ft-r """"master"""" commodity contract holders identifying the contract that will terminate as well as a list of all of the ft-r demand contracts that will continue to be effective in september."
2
"limiting nominations within a segment consistent with ferc's ruling in this docket and consistent with similar rulings on tennessee and texas gas, transco will limit the quantity of gas that can be scheduled  in any segment of the pipeline to the original firm contracted capacity."
transco will aggregate all nominations under an original ft contract and any related capacity release contracts (or subsequent re-releases) to ensure that the total scheduled quantity for the family of contracts is within the original contractual entitlement.
"if nominations for the family of contracts exceed the original entitlement, nominations using any secondary capacity rights will be considered as secondary nominations and subject to cut on a pro-rata basis."
"as stated above, transco intends to implement these changes for gas day september 1, 2000."
"in the event systematic changes cannot be completed or the ferc directs transco to modify its planned implementation, transco will notify customers via transit of any business practice changes as well as the expected implementation timeline."
"if you have any questions concerning these changes, please contact your customer services representative or scheduling analyst. - c.dtf"""

well..
i think thats gonna be a little late for me - although i would love to go.
guess we'll just have to wing it on friday!
i might get there a little early on friday and bowl a warmup game if you wanna do that.
see ya soon.
"well, sorry to hear your weekend sucked so bad."
mine was pretty awesome.
i was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since burns was in town i just didn't drink.
on friday night a bunch of us met up with burns at silver dollar pizza.
we hung out there for a while and then went to the gypsy.
i came home rather early since i wasn't drinking and didn't want to stay in the smokey gypsy when i was sick.
"then on saturday valarie, boyd and i drove down to the beavers game."
we had the best time.
we went to the peacock first and the  tailgated before the game.
"burnsy, sul, shef, chris and jimmy were so retarded by gametime."
i felt like a big babysitter being the only sober one.
the game was awesome and everyone but me valarie and boyd stayed down in corvallis.
"sunday i was still feeling sick but went to breakfast and shopping with cheryl and then we justed vegged at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies."
for being sick and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend i remarkebly had a great time.
i still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday becuase i started having some bad asthma.
t  everything else is going okay i guess.
i have my final interview for that position i want on thursday and then on friday i leave for la .
"so anyway, hope your week is going a little better than your weekend went."
doesn't sound like you had much fun.
were you and dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else?

the equitrans capacity deals exist!!
i will be working from home in the morning.
"""the reservation charge reduction applicable to tw's failure to deliver gas under certain circumstances does not apply to either force majeure events or periods of unscheduled maintenance less than 10 days in any calendar quarter."
"i am also not completely comfortable calling this """"force majeure"""" because part of the tariff definition is that the event was not within the control of either party; however, since the definition does include """"binding order of any court or governmental authority,"""" we could possibly say this is force majeure if we're reducing the pressure in order to comply with a dot pipeline safety rule."
"(in that event, our notice on the ebb would be a force majeure notice.)  if not, we can argue that since this is not """"maintenance,"""" but simply being done to construct the expansion in a safe and prudent manner, the shippers' rights are not triggered under the reservation charge reduction provisions."
"in that case, damages (if any) would have to be pursued under ordinary contract law."
"i realize that this is not a very satisfactory answer; however, the outage is going to be relatively short, and no shipper in recent memory has availed itself of the reservation charge reduction."
i recommend we give shippers reasonable notice of the pressure reduction so that they can make alternate plans -- this will reduce the likelihood that they will feel revengeful.
"please call (x30596) or e-mail if you have further questions."""

"""i called tino today to let him know that our affiliates are sniffing around a power plant opportunity and potential gas bypass pipeline in albuquerque."
"kevin, you should be getting a call from a guy in portland whose name i can't seem to find right now."
"he had gotten my name from thome out there and called to let me know that ena is interested in pitching either pnm or some outfit called """"delta"""" on development or expansion of a gas-fired power plant in the south part of albuquerque."
it didn't sound to me like ena was very far along in their deal.
i explained to this guy what we were involved in and swore him to confidentiality.
i also told him he need to call either kevin or steve before he talked to pnm.
i thought it was a little curious that ena is interested in generation in alb. all of a sudden.
"on the tino front, he apologized for not calling after their big doe meeting."
he said it went very well and that doe is considering their offer--$.
085/kwh power less revenue sharing for all surplus power sold.
tino and dennis offered doe 70% of the $$ from the surplus power sales until a certain target is hit (probably a target equivalent to doe's current pnm rate less 10%) and then 30% of any additional $$.
tino and dennis really blew some smoke by showing the doe guys this summer's four corners spot prices (generally in the $200-400/mwh range) and doing the math for them.
"on that basis, the net delivered power cost after rebate comes pretty close to zero."
"even using a more reasonable sampling of four corners prices, the doe price is apparently better than their current pnm price."
"the big issue is whether doe can figure out how to keep the rebate $$ at sandia, rather than lose the $$ to treasury."
"sounds like the dennis and tino show is still flogging this deal pretty hard, so i reminded tino that we are eager to do anything we can to help."

i thought i would try to summarize our meeting this week and document a list of agreed apon tasks.
1
the unify system is on the brink of disaster and everyone agrees that we have huge business risk if it blows up. -->  sally and beth are going to document the steps we are taking to maintain the system and minimize the chances of a failure.
(everyone understands that this is a difficult task but it sounds like it should be a high priority) 2.
the database to run the gas books takes way too long and is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff. -->  beth is moving from sun-o-s to sun-sularis which should allow us to address the problem.
we have 4 contractors working on this and we are expecting it to take 6 weeks.
once this project is complete we can add hardware and reduce the time problems.
3
the traders need better real time management tools that ultimately combine their physical and financial trades together and identify their real time risk.
tds was a system that was built to help this however it does not meet all the traders needs.
this ultimately needs to be a system that is commissioned by the               traders to meet their needs. -->  phillip allen is going to prepare a list of trader needs in consultation with all the gas desks heads.
after this beth should try to come up with a plan to get a system that meets all the traders needs.
4
the power system is unstable and fails on a regular basis.
this is leading to long hours on the part of our back office staff.
beth has made progress in this area and we are going to monitor the improvements over the next 4 to 6 weeks to see if the improvements prove to be working.
5
steve natt  is going to put a plan together that meets with kevin presto's approval that addresses our needs with respect to all-requirements deals and volume management deals in the east.
6
there will be no more business trips to london (somewhat kidding).
7
"portland has issues with speed do to the fact that we still run their books through an interface with houston. -->  john lavorato will talk to tim beldon and beth to determine whether its worthwile to put servers in portland. -->  since tim was not in the meeting, john will make sure we are covering all his needs."

ownership and passion are important characteristics of our best commercial people but so is fostering a diversity of opinions and ideas.
"with the back and mid office,  the current enron model is based upon scale and standardization which generates tremendous operating leverage."
"further, it helps us manage risk and is a board mandated control issue."
"in the long-run, it is actually less costly (ie) systems that don't work together, less transferable human capital, un-managed legal risks, etc. a lot of your points are very valid and haedicke has never and never will get in the way of managing commercial business; however, mark, wes, sally, beth et al have a mandate to provide a flexible, scalable but standardized delivery mechanism, that manages our risk across the broad empire."

"""lorraine, see the attached."
"i added """"maximum"""" and """"minimum"""" to the chart but don't know whether i got it backwards...anyway, let's talk if you have any questions."""
fyi.
i changed the pricing on the september deal (#
"however, since this usually involves an unacceptable amount of risk to both the shipper and tw, the marketers haven't done any index-based rates and have no current plans to enter into any such deals."
i have been asked by the commercial group to revisit this issue and to think of other ways we could increase our ability to charge more than the maximum rate.
ideally they would like to eliminate the language i've quoted above.
"however, my research has indicated that absent our 1) bringing about radical change in the way ferc thinks about recourse rates or 2) showing that tw lacks market power, we are probably stuck with this language."
why the problem exists (you may already know): steve stojic and i did some looking into why the language is in our tariff in the first place.
"in the alternative rates policy statement (rm95-6-000), the commission explained that it is willing to entertain individual requests for negotiated rates, but only where customers retain the ability to choose a cost-of-service based tariff rates.  """
"""[t]he availability of a recourse service would prevent pipelines from exercising market power by assuring that the customer can fall back to cost-based, traditional service if the pipeline unilaterally demands excessive prices or withholds service."
"thus, the recourse rate mitigates market power."""
""" the commission went on to confirmed that under rofr provisions the highest rate that an existing shipper must match if it wishes to continue its transportation arrangement is the maximum tariff rate."
"this policy is clearly not limited to rofr situations:  when capacity is constrained, a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate.  """
"""when there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available, then the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate, for example on a pro rata basis if required by its tariff."""
"""  the example cited by the commission:  if a pipeline has 100 dth/d available and two shippers request that capacity, one who is willing to pay no more than the recourse rate of $5 and another a negotiated rate of $6, then each would be allocated 50 dth/d on a pro rata basis (assuming the tariff provided for pro rata allocation and not some other allocation method such as lottery)."
"when tw filed for authority to charge negotiated rates, it voluntarily added the statement that """"if the rate bid exceeds the maximum tariff rate, then the rate will be considered to be the maximum tariff rate."""
"""  presumably we had concluded that we needed to add this recourse rate related provision in order to receive negotiated rate authority."
solutions??
i would like to know whether you concur that changing our tariff language outright is probably out of the question.
i feel as if i've really been chasing my tail here.
i have owed lindy an answer for some time now.
"but i keep coming back to our having to prove lack of market power (which, drew, is where i believe you were headed when we talked about this in mid-october)."
steve harris has asked whether we can just start small and remove the recourse rate cap as to only a portion of our system.
i think we would still have to show lack of market power in order to do this.  do you agree?
stojic warns that proving lack of market power is a lengthy and expensive proposition.
"might be worth it to us, though."
another idea is to somehow provide shippers with an incentive to pay more than max rate.
"after all, we do have authority to charge negotiated rates."
we've seen one instance in which one of our marketers was able to get more than max rates for it space based on good customer relations alone.
"however, despite our wonderful relationships with most of our customers, it's unlikely we can pull this off with any consistency."
we wondered whether we might be able to get more than max rates in the context of an auction procedure.
but i just am not convinced we could get around the commission's requirement that recourse rates be available.
that requirement has not changed.
have either of you seen anything to the contrary?
"i would like to meet with you two, plus several others i have in mind, to discuss this, preferably early this week (tues. or wed.), but would like to discuss briefly with you first."

hi!
you must have esp!
last night i told dick i needed to call  and see how you were and what you were doing for christmas.
we have to work on the 26th (even though it's an ene holiday) so we would have to come back on christmas day if we went home.
we decided to stay in houston.
i'm so glad you are going home but to tell the truth i feel like you do about traveling during the holidays.
nothing new with us - just about finished decorating the house but sometimes i think i'll never get done.
i have not bought a thing for dick yet - still do not know what to get him!
i guess i'll be one of those crazies out shopping on christmas eve.
we went home for thanksgiving and i caught a cold that i'm just now getting over.
will you be coming to houston in the near future?
if you do you are more than welcome to stay with us while your here - we would love to have you!
better go but let's meet like this more often!
take care and have a very merry christmas!
approved.
please process.
"thanks, sally beck<br>enron north america corp."

"in continuing with that process to bring you more value for your local production and to improve the efficiency of our gathering system, we would like to continue a process where compression into our gathering system may be approved."
"we have been able to grant a limited number of these requests in the past, and would now like to make this opportunity somewhat more widely available to the producers."
"for this second offering, the process we will use is as follows:  for a period of 30 days, beginning 12:00 noon on may 24, 2000, the gathering and production division of dominion transmission will accept applications for compression rights into its gathering system for gas feeding its schutte compressor station."
"the dominion """"bubbles"""" affected are 4404 & 4405."
"dominion recognizes that, although limited, there does exist the incremental capacity for throughput through these compressor stations."
the incremental capacity authorized through new compression agreements will not exceed the limit dominion determines to be the capacity of the existing compressors.
"dominion will attempt to be flexible in approving the applications it receives, but will limit approved applications so as to not unreasonably interfere with the production from the existing non-compressed gas entering the system."
please submit your written application to joe thompson at the dominion gathering & production office.
"the application must indicate the amount of """"incremental"""" gas for the specific compression agreement."
dominion recognizes that the installation of compression requires differing time frames.
"we will balance that consideration with our need to insure that the application process is not abused to the disadvantage of other producers; therefore, once granted, the applicant must have the compression in place and operable within six months of dominion's approval, or the rights to all unconstructed capacity will be forfeited."
"in the event that more requests for compression rights for incremental gas are received than for which there is capacity, dominion will award the rights on a prorated basis."

"mike, here's a revised version of the option agreement."
"i changed the shipping dates, quantity (10), outside exercise date, and the amount of the option payment."
"i did not change the prices, since i had not discussed this with ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work."
have there been some changes to the data sheets?
it appears to me that there might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.
"in the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on the load losses had not been agreed, so the prices did not reflect the option."
please call or email me if you have any questions or comments.

"greg,  a couple of other thoughts and ideas for monday's meeting."
"i would like to discuss the entire process chain as part of the timelines, personnel responsibilities and key action items."
i think this is another good way to find any potential gaps and help prioritize various items and assignments.
andrew parsons sr. director (and superior performer) is a great and very smart guy that can add a lot of value to the effort.
you will like him and he will be a very valuable resource to add to the team - even if it is for a couple of weeks.
he wrote the it compliance process chain and could reverse engineer difficult parts that are unique to the ariba platform.
he has others on his team that could help and i've asked him to think about his existing aa resources that are available (some are working on clickpaper already).
"other resources that have been identified to potential added firepower in the short run:  beth pearlman, john tollefson (it), bob schultz (lk said she could spare him without delaying phase 2 roll out), dave forester (not a good option because it would definitely set back phase 2 roll out), mary solmenson, scott mills, berry pearce, david port, david sweeny, sally beck (advice and discuss additional resources)."
i did ask louise to jump in (and i know you did too) to help on some quick thoughts on process and lessons learned.
"i saw the process maps for eol and i think they, or the simplified early versions, are very important and key to a successful launch for clickpaper."
i went by to see mark palmer (he was out) and left him a voice mail on the marketing effort and what margarat allen is doing.
i wanted him to make sure that he understood the importance and priority of this effort.
i also talked with beth pearlman about helping out (or assigning john tollefson) and i told her that we would be talking about this on monday afternoon. do we need to have alan aronowitz or mark taylor look over the agreements to add a trading perspective?
"a few thoughts,  see you tomorrow."

just an update: today i set up a front month fixed price gas daily product priced at parity to nymex.
i thought the response was tremendous.
it really shows that we might have an angle to put out more of the curve and become the predominant benchmark for the industry rather than the exchange.
one problem i had was linking 2 syncopated basis products.
i set up a new product for the prompt that was nov gd/d henry hub that was a syncopated basis of 0/0 to the nov nymex.
"however, since dec nymex is a syncopated basis to nov nymex, i could not set up a syncopated basis link around the dec nymex."
any ideas?

patti was always the first one in the office during this time.
"frequently, she would be at work before 4 am to prepare the daily operation package."
all the traders came to depend on the information patti provided.
this information has been extremely critical this year due to the pipeline explosion and size of the west desk positions.

"amy and john, several people within the real time group are curious as to the process regarding our new holiday bonus pay."
we are all extremely grateful to have this new compensation package but some clarification would be great.
i would assume that we would be paid for working a holiday on the following pay period.
for example i worked on the friday after thanksgiving ( considered a minor holiday $250).
would it be correct to assume that i would be paid for that holiday on december 15th?
would this bonus pay be included in our regular paycheck or come seperate like an expense check?
is there anything we need to do?
it seems that several people within the group are unclear on this new policy other than the amount of the pay.
could you please clarify this process for us?

"on june 6, he filed to sell 90,000 shares valued at $5.0 million, or $55 a share, through morgan stanley dean witter, lead underwriter of ariba's ipo one year ago."
"may 30 he filed to sell 100,000 shares for $7 million, and may 18 the kinsey family foundation filed to sell 14,000 shares for $1.1 million."
"marketing vice president david rome filed to sell 150,000 shares for $10.5 million on may 30."
"robert d. lent, vice president for corporate development, filed may 24 to sell 200,000 shares for $14.3 million."
"the sales come long after ariba's price peaked at $183.34 in early march, before the nasdaq stock market plunged amid the fallout over rising interest rates and concern about soaring valuations."
"back then insiders, who began to sell immediately after the six-month lock-up on their shares expired, were reaping far more from their sales: rome, for example, indicated in a february 1 filing he would sell 200,000 shares for $35 million."
"business-to-business is regarded as the hottest of the internet's hot spots, and ariba as a leader in its niche."
"the insider sales are tiny in comparison with the company's 235.8 million outstanding shares, but they make a dent in the float -- more than two-thirds of ariba's stock is owned by insiders and institutions."
"the s-1 document, easily accessible via edgar online, is extensive and includes such information as: risk factors, financials, strategy, industry trends, management bios, investors and more."

"andy: the problem if we limit the size on options to being what size is offered on the swap hedge, we will not be able to offer adequate size on the options."
"optimally, i think we want to offer a minimum size of 100 across all strikes."
"if the swap is 4/4.5, one a day up, and someone buys half a day, making the market, 4/4.5 one a day by half a day, the size offered on a 10 cent out of the money call might be as low as 30 contracts, a much smaller size than most people want to trade."
"if we restrict to strikes with a lower delta, we face the problem of not offering enough strikes and not making a market in options that have open eol interest that have moved closer to the money."
maybe the answer is to assume the swap hedge to be a penny wide two way wrapped around the eol swap mid market.
"thus if the front swap on eol is 4/4.5 one a day by half a day,  the input into the option calculator is 3.75/4.75, 100 up."
"in this case i think 100 is necessary because once a strike has open interest, we must continue to support it."
thus i anticipate having to make markets in deep itm options as the market moves.
"in terms of straddle strikes, i think the edge received from buying straddles struck on the eol offer and vice-versa is not big enough to compensate for what i think the industry will view as a scam and another way enron is trying to rip people off."
"although striking on the mid-market is probably easier for the trader, i actually think striking in five cent increments makes more sense."
it allows people to trade out of the position on eol.
"whereas if someone buys the 3085 straddle and the market moves to 3200, they have to call ene to close the trade."
"if the trade is struck at 3100, we will have a market on both the 3100 call and put at all times."
"secondly, i would anticipate non-volatility driven option traders may elect to sell either just the put or call in this scenario depending on their view of market direction."
"joe, i think the entire event was outstanding."
i also enjoyed it but my hand still hurts!
spoke with john sherriff this am re prc for london rac people.
john said they included our people for cross calibration purposes but we could rank our people where we saw fit.
so i don't think there is any issue here.
the houston prc rankings should stand unless there was new information brought to light to you steve that calls into question a person's ranking.
sheila- please double check with the london hr people that this is straightened out.
"thanks, rick"
"john, we did a deal with peoples the co-manage some of there assets."
we are actually setting up a chicago office with them and sending some people to it.

but wanted to share... mel dog bites threaten home insurance homeowner coverage may be cancelled if your pooch is considered too aggressive charles v. tines / the detroit news metlife no longer writes coverage for people who own a pit bull or four other dogs with attitudes.
by charlie cain / news lansing bureau chief a sizable increase in the number -- and severity -- of dog bites in metro detroit is increasingly forcing insurance companies to cancel homeowner policies at homes where the family pooch has displayed a bad attitude.
"at least one national insurance company, metlife auto & home, no longer writes homeowner coverage for people who own any of five different breeds of large, often aggressive, dogs: pit bulls, rottweilers, chow chows, german shepherds and bull terriers. """
"""our overall position is that if you have one of those breeds in your household, we will not insure you because we don't believe there's a way to match the risk with the rate,"""" said richard bernstein, a metlife vice-president. """
"""dog bites tend to be difficult cases, emotionally traumatic and costly."""
""" the insurance information institute in new york said insurers now shoulder a quarter of the record $1 billion cost associated with dog bites -- from medical treatment to """"pain and suffering"""" damage awards."
"a third of all homeowner claims result from dog bites; about 70 percent of insurance carriers won't renew coverage to a policyholder whose dog has bitten someone. """
"""we're seeing a surge of dog bite claims with pit bulls and rottweilers,"""" said mike erwin, a spokesman for the institute, which represents about 350 companies nationwide. """
"""those are not just a nip, but a tearing of the skin that requires a lot more medical treatment and as a result, the costs go up."""
""" dogs were particularly aggressive in detroit last year; the city reported 1,574 dog bites -- up 38 percent from 1996."
"macomb county reported 1,020 dog bites last year, up 9.5 percent from a year earlier."
"the oakland county animal shelter, which covers much of the county, said the number of bites there remained constant at about 800."
"nationally, the center for disease control and prevention said 4.7 million dog bites were reported in 1997."
"justin harbert, a 4-year-old warren boy, joined the growing list of victims last week when a neighbor's chow chow lunged at his throat."
"it took 12 stitches to close the boy's wound in bi-county hospital. """
"""it didn't really dawn on me that there might be a problem,"""" said his father, gary harbert, who was taking his son to breakfast and stopped briefly at the neighbor's house. """
"""i saw my son go to pet the dog and the dog jumped across the table and went for his throat."""
""" the journal of the american medical association estimates that nearly half of all children will be bitten by age 12."
"gary mitchell, a spokesman for the michigan association of insurance, said the larger dogs that people are buying now to protect their homes are a particular concern."
"too often, the dogs are bred to be vicious at puppy mills, he said. """
"""more people will be bitten by poodles and cocker spaniels than pit bulls this year simply because there are so many more of them,"""" he said. """
"""but the serious injuries are caused by dogs like the pit bull."
"the increase in lawsuits is the result of the attacks by these large, aggressive animals. """
"""people want them for protection, but the problem is these dogs often don't know the difference between a burglar and the kid next door or the mailman."
"those are the people who are being bit and those are the people that are suing."""
""" last year, 2,795 postal carriers were bitten and the u.s. postal service now is routinely suing dog owners."
"farmington hills attorney sam bernstein said his office handles """"quite a few"""" dog bite claims and he has seen """"a lot of gruesome attacks, particularly by dogs whose owners allow them to roam the neighborhood."""
""" he said michigan is like 30 other states with strict liability laws that say if your dogs bites someone, you're responsible. """
"""there seems to be much more serious injuries today among people who are bitten by dogs,"""" bernstein said."
"state farm insurance, michigan's largest provider of homeowner insurance, said it had 441 dog bites claims last year, up nearly 41 percent from 1996. """
"""for the last two years, michigan has been the fifth-highest state in the amount paid out in dog claims by state farm,"""" said john carroll, a company spokesman."
"the insurer's michigan costs last year were $81,367 in medical claims and another $3.27 million to settle liability claims. """
"""we don't deny coverage based on breed since any breed can be trained to bite,"""" carroll said. """
"""but after one bite, we insist the homeowner resolve the situation. """
"""the policy will be discontinued if they continue to keep the dog on premises."""

steve filled in the detail for me on the lg&e issue mentioned in the law bullets this morning.
a valve was left open between an lg&e facility and northern for an approximate 3 month period (i'm not sure how recent).
"lg&e's gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into northern was approx. 180,000 mmbtu, with a value of about $500,000."
rockey and steve have talked to lg&e and it does not appear that we have any good arguments for avoiding the liability.
the unexpected (and unmetered) deliveries from lg&e presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance during the referenced 3 month period.
"accordingly, i assume the cost of replacing that gas should be accounted for in northern's pra and so should not affect earnings."
i'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this matter.

65 /dth after the january transaction is complete.
here are my questions/comments; 1.
david - please look at the new deal i created for this exchange (deal 146788).
the existing deal (deal 138741) is set up as a pipeline exchange.
i believe the counterparty should be equitable gas company which is the ldc.
"if it looks ok to you, i will kill the old deal and add the volumes to the new deal."
please let me know asap.

i would like to see a) what ces was paying equitable for this deal and b) when the payment was due.

i have no idea what all the requirements are and when they recruit.
what type of position is he interested in - treasury?
i feel bad but she understands.
i think she might come up and be with me for thanksgiving.
i have a six day break right around then and i think it would be good for her to just get away for a while.

i had a couple of dates while i was in la.
they went very well and she might come up in december for a weekend!

"karen, it appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to enron:  risk of damage to a certain road during construction."
it would seem that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a result of the construction.

what is the intent?
the delivery point was changed and the energy wasn't.

professor titman: i would like to thank you for taking the time to recommend me to the mba program.
"in the end, the results were not favorable."
"i understand that it is a competitive process, but i felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, extrcurricular activities, etc., that this would help my chances and possibly compensate my disability."
"after talking with you and professors ronn, brown and jemison, i was sure that ut was the right place to continue learning about energy-finance."
"i am still sure that ut is the place for getting an excellent graduate-level education, so i want you to know that i am going to do what ever it takes to get in next year."
i plan on taking a couple of graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions office that i can compete at this level.
i also plan on trying to retake the gmat test.
"due to my disability, this will be a monumental task, but i am determined to prove to the admissions committment that i can do the work at the texas university graduate school of business."
"also, i would like to continue our dialague regarding creating an energy-finance private equity fund at ut."
i know that with my industry-wide and investment banking contacts that i can help raise capital for the fund.
i am very interested in energy-finance and think that your idea is a very good.
thanks again for taking the time to listen and talk with me.
it has been a pleasure to meet with you and i hope we can continue to talk about energy and finance in the future.
"also, if you think of anything else i can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know."
take care and hope to hear from you soon.

i was very moved by it and you know i feel the same way.

"i am so thankful and appreciative and although i have always been religious and spiritual, it has grown more deeply."
i see so many people that have lost their perspective and i pray that i will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that our family has received.

"guys, i appreciate the quality work and deal flow that you are generating."
in an effort to measure and reward performance from our middle market groups we have attempted to come up with several standardized reports to be issued monthly and to be reviewed at the qbr.
i am a strong believer in that what is measured and rewarded gets done.
"as well, the middle market capability is crucial to the continued growth of our business; therefore, reporting metrics which define high performance will ensure great deal makers get rewarded and that  you will be able to attract high quality talent into the mid market groups."
"baughman and presto have created a number of reports and metrics for the east power group, i would like you to take a look and let me know how they should be changed to reflect the business in the west."
"upon agreement on the metrics, i would like issue these reports on a monthly basis."
tammy sheppherd will get you a copy of the reports/metrics utilized in the east.

the b= asic  organizational framework has been set.
"as you know, diomedes christodoulou and jim bannantine will be assuming new=   responsibilities within enron."
"replacing them will be orlando gonzalez and=   joe kishkill, who will become the co-presidents of south america, reporting=   to dave delainey and john lavorato."
"they will share overall responsibility= ;  however, orlando=01,s focus will be on direct sales origination,  commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues."
"joe=01,s focus = will  be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overal= l  country management."
"in addition, orlando will continue as president and ce= o  of elektro until its ultimate sale."
"the existing, large integrated asset base in south america (excluding  elektro) will be managed and operated by rebecca mcdonald and jim hughes in=   enron global assets, which is part of enron wholesale services under mark=   frevert."
"ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both brazil a= nd  argentina between enron americas and enron global assets to ensure that our=   reputation in south america is protected, our asset positions are being  managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these asset= s  are pursued."
the remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in south  america will be organized around the highly successful north american netwo= rk  business model.
"this model employs people, market making, physical  commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-valu= e  products to our customers."
it is people and intellectual capital based and=   enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.
"in the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report = to  joe and orlando:   the commercial origination team will be lead by brett wiggs."
"the team will=   focus on covering south american markets, primarily brazilian and argentine=   natural gas and electricity, with the following goals: ?"
"generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services=   needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital  capabilities; ?"
"providing those products and services across south america and across the=   value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value=   opportunity; ?"
finding structural value arbitrages in the south american market and move=   quickly to capitalize; ?
assisting the risk management and trading organization in managing the  overall risk of the organization; ?
"managing all new power and asset development opportunities in south ameri= ca  consistent with this strategy, and ?"
providing the risk management and trading organization information and de= al  flow.
"the commercial origination team will consist of a diverse group of people w= ho  work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,=   capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal executio= n,  finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals."
the trading and risk management team will be headed by remi collonges.
the=   team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book=   for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sale= s  efforts.
"additionally, the team will work toward implementation of activel= y  trading south american energy commodities."
"this group will be responsible=   for managing enron south america=01,s overall risk and will have a direct=   reporting relationship with john lavorato in his role as head of the americ= as  risk activities."
"the argentine effort will be integrated into the overall south american  commercial origination and trading and risk management groups; however, we=   will continue to maintain an argentine office headed by michael guerriero."

"the following support  functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial tea= m  and will report into joe and orlando, plus into their line functions in  houston."
"the overall goal is to ensure that the south american business  units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as=   well as manage day-to-day business and risk."
"otherwise, the houston  infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements=   in south america, not unlike other businesses in enron americas."
"these groups include: the government affairs team, which will be headed by sergio assad, will  manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as=   governmental ministries."
"the primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate= ,  in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a  functioning wholesale traded market in brazil and argentina."
sergio will  assume his responsibilities upon completion of the elektro sale.
"during th= is  interim period, jose bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulator= y  function."
"once sergio makes the transition, he will also report to rick  shapiro in enron government affairs."
the finance team will be headed by britaldo soares.
the team will manage t= he  interface with enron global finance.
britaldo will transition from his  current duties at elektro upon completion of the elektro sale.
britaldo wi= ll  also report to joe deffner in enron global finance.
"rob gay will be  assisting britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the=   cuiaba project."
"the legal team, which will be lead by randy young, as general counsel, and=   john novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage south america=01,s legal=   requirements."
randy and john will also report to mark haedicke in enron  wholesale services - legal department.
miguel padron will become chief of staff.
"human resources, information  technology, treasury, accounting & reporting, as well as administration wil= l  report to miguel."
"this will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial=   functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting  relationships with enron."
miguel will also report to david oxley in enron=   wholesale services =01) human resources and wes colwell in enron wholesale=   services =01) business analysis and reporting.
these changes are consistent with enron's evolving business strategy and  reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our  financial and intellectual capital.
"however, in line with the new  organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the  region, further budget reductions will be necessary."
people directly  affected will be notified shortly.
enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its  businesses in south america.
"we believe that as the markets develop, we ar= e  uniquely positioned to leverage enron=01,s core capabilities and create  shareholder value."

we will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow constraints on epng.
the currrent capacity cuts in the sj and socal topock delivery points are 50%.
i would like my p&l to show this risk.
please find a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set in newcurrentday by either myself or monique.
"also, we will need to set up a new physical curve for mojave topock."
our transport is currently being reallocated by epng for deliveries to mojave instead of socal topock.
"i would like to show the transport on epng value as sj plus cost to mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any."
the risk is showing the value of sj to socal topock (currently wide spreads for 2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to mojave topock.

"df<br>fyi, a daily report put out by cibc illustrating their view on the emerging=   market... daily teletimes  cibc world markets we had a very informative meeting with enron=01,s management yesterday--jef= f  skilling, ceo of enron (ene - buy) as well as ken rice, ceo of enron  communications and their software vp, david berberian and others."
enron has=   built out a substantial fiber network and begun to make substantial moves=   towards developing a bandwidth trading market.
"we don=01,t believe that a = lot  of telecom investors understand how well thought out and agressive enron  plans on being in this market."
it appears that enron is now planning to  articulate its strategy- specifically at their investor conference on janua= ry  20th in new york.
"while details will have to wait until the 20th, enron is=   essentially aiming to build a gateway tieing in all the major long-distance=   networks, guaranteeing premium quality and pricing in doing so (i.e. a   =01&network of networks=018)."
"while ene does plan to use its own network t= o carry  traffic, it plans to focus largely on seamlessly integrating capacity bough= t  on other carriers networks."
"operationally, this boils down to a very smart=   switching system that gives customers the capabilities and reliability of a=   single network at the front-end while integrating capacity sourced from  multiple networks on the back end, creating more robust overall transport=   capabilities."
"ene believes that this integration of multiple networks will=   offer greater path diversity, reliability, and efficiency than any  single-network solution."
"we note that enron=01,s multi-sourcing approach i= s  tailor-made to foster the development of a robust capacity trading market (= as  discussed in our recent bandwidth trading report)."
"given enron=01,s domina= nce  of the electricity and natural gas markets, we believe that there is no  better positioned company to create and capitalize on such a market in  bandwidth."
"while we await further details, we did leave the meeting with = a  much greater understanding of and confidence in ene=01,s overall telecom  strategy."
we believe that their telecom business could create tens of  billions of dollars of shareholder value if ene executes well.
we recommen= d  that telecom investors make an effort to attend the jan. 20 meeting.

"as we said before, i would like to be able to utilize todd hall for special projects from time to time."
"i had mentioned to mike jordan that once todd completed his commoditylogic role that i thought that we could take some of his time to follow up on continental power issues, which could fit nicely with some work he could do on weather in europe."
i don't know about the one month timeframe.
i would prefer that todd review the initiatives and determine the best way to proceed.
"it might mean a couple of weeks over there for starters, and then a follow up, shorter trip a few weeks later."
"i don't think that todd is keen on any elongated stays in europe, particularly without the family."
can we still use todd ?

i'm about to set up 11 contracts on trco for may.  there is no rush on setting these contracts up for unify.
after reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they all used to be?
i never in my life imagined the intense impact an email could have.
"they appear so harmless at first glance with no character or personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths."
i really don't know what to say about the email.
"if i didn't know what happened afterward i would have said it was very promising, but knowing what i know i must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just confused."
i must say though that his quote was outstanding and if ben and i had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us i would send it to him in a heartbeat.
but we don't so i'll just have to enjoy it solo.
i fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email dialogue throughout the day.
that is by far the best line of the day!!
"john, i need information on the following questions related to cornhusker: 1)  i understand that we will be handling the invoicing and settlements of the supply, transport, and sales contracts."
who will be handling the financiol accounting  and reporting for these deals?
2)  is someone in legal currently assigning the contracts to ena?
3)  what is the name of the company purchasing the supply/fuel at the plant?
4)  tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the pipeline for july and august activity.
is this true?
i thought we weren't taking responsibility for this until september business.
we are not prepared to pay the suppliers for july.
5)  should these deals be in an accrual or mtm book?
thanks.

they have not received any financials for acn power.
"thanks, phillip allen"
let me know what you think.
"david, here is a short list of what it takes to pull positions into the benchmark."
1)  once a book is officialized it must be loaded into grms before the positions can be pulled into the benchmark.
2) with everyone officializing books around the same time the grms que is overloaded and positions are very slow to be loaded into grms.
3)  grms processes books in the order that they are officialized.
"if one of your books is officialized behind either the nymex, power, or canadian books your book will not  be loaded into grms until these books are finished."
this process can take up to 45 minutes to complete.
4)  i have to manually create text files for deals that they system is not designed to handle.
these files must then be loaded into grms.
4)  i have to manually override post-ids that for one reason or another do not come in automatically or that come in incorrectly.
5)  the benchmark query takes approximately 15 minutes to complete.
"the more books that are officialized, the longer the query takes."
"6)  when books are unofficialized and reofficialized, this effectively sends that book to the back of the grms que."
this means that the entire process must be started over.
"7)  now that plugging positions is no longer an option, i have to spend time researching any variances that arise between the grms position and the erms position."
"8)  if the book admin and i cannot solve the problem, then i have to contact the grms support team."
since this usually occurs after their regular hours it takes a while before they can get back in touch with me.
9)  i cannot query new data while i'm researching variances or on the phone with grms support because i need access to  the information that is currently in the bench.
"10)  finally, this is a massive file therefore we frequently get errors and have to shut down."
even if the spreadsheet has been saved and no data is lost it still take about 10 minutes just to shut this file down and reopen it.
if you have any more questions let me know.

no - i think that ahlstrom should take this risk or it should be reflected in a price reduction.

basically jeff said we must get this exposure down but gave no parameters to the statement.
"he did ask if any recent issue is causing us concern to which we said no, and i also said we know more about this company than any other exposure we have (which we should)."
"i also spoke with m. kopper today and he thinks the proposed deal w/ txu to pay slightly more for a plant with the proviso that we get a cleaner contract is a good idea, rather than paying a lot of money to an investment bank."
moral of story in my opinion is to try and improve deal structure with txu through the plant purchase or other structured deal. do no more (large) deals with txu that significantly increase credit exposure ($10mm??) unless we buy a derivative that reduces exposure simultaneously.
continue to stay on top of txu with frequent meetings with their management to maintain a close relationship with good communication.
lets try and discuss wed if possible.

"lucy, the rent roll spreadsheet is starting to look better."
see if you can add these modifications: 1.
use a formula in column e.  add the value in column c to column d.  it should read =c6+d6.
then copy this formula to the rows below.
2
column h needs a formula.
subtract amount paid from amount owed.
#name?

column f is filled with the #### sign.
this is because the column width is too narrow.

the pg&e basis position in tds does not match the feb/mar position.
the baja spread was executed as a nov-mar position months ago.
the only real changes were to socal basis over time.
there is no telling when this might have changed in error.
will you please research the position to see when this position was reduced.
i am guessing that a park and loan was executed by frank ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to gd new by mistake.

jeff donahue is not so sure but will meet with him on friday.

i think we could use that co-ordination with his group as long as we didn't get a part time guy in the process.
he could also report to us obviously (like larry) but i think in this case a dual role makes a  lot of sense.
what do you think?
"if you like don, he could be an immediate candidate to start doing our corp dev work, but that is of course not the best reason."
i thought he was all right and he did have a good understanding of our products and is an innovative thinker.
"he has also worked as a trader and although it doesn't seem possible by his personality, having some background is a plus."

"as you know, current firm contracts on transwestern provide for delivery of 250 mmcf/d of gas to topock."
"in the context of the gallup expansion, transwestern has entered into firm contracts for an additional 40 mmcf/d to topock."
"once the gallup expansion is built, transwestern will have a total of 290 mmcf/d of firm capacity under contract to the topock delivery point: 40 mmcf/d more than pg&e has agreed to accept while pcbs continue to be present."
bill cordes has asked what transwestern's potential liability to shippers would be if pg&e's refusal to accept deliveries due to the continued presence of contaminants causes transwestern to have to curtail firm service at pg&e/topock.
the legal answer is that transwestern's tariff provides for a reservation charge refund but does not limit the damages that could be sought by a shipper.
"more specifically, rate schedule fts-1 specifically provides for a reservation charge refund if transwestern fails to deliver gas for a firm shipper."
"in december, january, february, july and august, the shipper is entitled to a reservation charge refund for all nominated and confirmed quantities not delivered."
"in all other months, the shipper is entitled to a refund only if deliveries fall below 75% of nominated/confirmed quantities for a period of 75 consecutive days."
the tariff does not preclude a shipper from seeking other damages resulting from transwestern's failure to provide service under an fts-1 contract.
"a shipper whose firm service is curtailed would likely incur damages in addition to the reservation charge, including, for example, the cost of buying spot gas or damages resulting from the shipper's inability to fulfill contractual obligations."
such damages could be recovered in a breach of contract action.
not all shippers would incur such damages because some might be willing to take delivery of gas at alternate points if capacity is available at such points.
bill has asked steve to work with me in quantifying our potential exposure.
i could really use your help in putting a dollar amount on potential damages.
can we meet briefly to discuss this?
"i'm available after the gallup meeting tomorrow a.m., or after lunch on friday...or we can discuss a meeting time for next week."
thank you.
call me when you get back.

"we'll keep working this angle if their new attorney shows up on deck, but i think susan and i have done as much as can be done with howard h.  do any of you know what the red cedar facilities look like?"
"i.e. how many miles of line, any big diameter line, any compression, etc?  howard must have read some old cases and gotten himself spooked that their facilites aren't gathering under the modified primary function test."
"i'm not sure why he thinks signing a transport contract with us will make their situation any worse, but that seems to be his conclusion."
"if steve and bill can't nudge red cedar's management into doing the deal, i'd suggest that you both or one of you ask tsuri (sp?) to have his new lawyer call me and susan after howard leaves, maybe with one of the kinder morgan lawyers on the phone also, and we'll try to straighten this out."
for discussion this a.m.
"jm, the message below is related to deal #138094."

"we are still working on the plane, and the answer is that the plane will be billed to the rc reserving it for the flight."
if commercial wants to take it to a lower level than that it will be up to them to do so.
"it will take some actual doing on our side to make this happen, but it can be done."
the budget will be taken care of in planning as we go through the year.
from an ets point of view all of the plane is in commercial or executive (stan) and so it should not be a problem to track the budget.
tracy has the point on this one.
jim saunders:    what do you know about the other comments?
when is your big day again?????
keep me informed!!
looks good but we need to talk about the index product because the decsription is too long as it stands now and we need to rename the current product and create a new one also
"per bass- like last year we get 13 guys, one must remain on ir for the entire week."

please find attached the file that dawn sent to me.
sorry for the delay.
next month i'll be more prepared.
"thanks, errol mclaughlin, x5-8274"
good to hear from you.
have a good trip up in nyc and i will talk to you when you get back.
in the next couple of days pull up the enron ticker and check out the other deal i have been working on.
we closed it this weekend.
"regards, ben"
"please protect thursday afternoon, august 10th for me."
i have some important personal stuff to take care of.

"""the attached draft reflects revisions made pursuant to our discussions with ferc staff."
you will be receiving a hard copy of the tariff sheets separately.
"please make sure you read the """"waivers"""" section towards the end of the document as it contains some additional requests for waivers."
"also, there seems to be some confusion over whether we are going to post all options, not just shipper call options."
my previous drafts have provided for posting of shipper call options only.
"all other types of options will be generally available, on a nondiscriminatory basis, through our tariff."
"my thinking was that it is commercially impracticable to post the specifics of all types of options, and it's not necessary since options will be noted on our transaction reports required by order 637."
let me know what you think.
let me know your comments as soon as possible.
i understand that the commercial group told stan horton this would be filed this week and shelley reported at staff meeting on monday that it would be filed this week or next week.
as soon as i get everyone's comments we can get this finalized.
"thank you."""
don't make any changes for now.
i need to draft a more detailed memo.
"give me a break...just like last year, i will finish ahead of you again."

"jeff, i have an enron board of directors meeting that may extend until approximately 1:"
"karen, please forward the revisions once you get them."
"thanks, kay"
what do you think about this strategy?
maybe we should have deb call marion and review the list of hotels where enron has a corporate rate and ask her opinion regarding which ones she would recommend.
maybe -at that point she would volunteer her flat?
re: missing apb deal tom a buying koch 20-30 25 mw 114.00 palo on peak tom alonso just returned my call and verified that he had entered the deal.
"jeff richter had entered it, thinking it wasn't in the system, so i'm now killing his deal."
the correct deal number is 461133.
thanks a lot.
i've redlined the outline to address what i believe is the most important risk you guys will face out there:  the risk that ferc will listen to your presentation and conclude that the embedded optionality that some pipelines are currently offering in transport contracts is a negotiated term and condition and therefore must be stopped.
"i think we need to tailor the presentation and filing to minimize the chance that ferc will take away flexibility we think we now have (i.e., the flexibility to embed shipper puts in transport contracts)."
"even if the tw approach on unbundled options goes nowhere, several of the strategies we may want to implement next year depend on continued ability to sell embedded options."
"susan, shelley,a nd mkm, i still think it is a good idea to push this proposal, but am concerned that ferc might squirrel and go the opposite direction we are trying to push them."
your thoughts?
"i think so, you saw the email i sent this morning regarding india."
you must visit there so we need to have it atleast long enough for you to visit!!!!!!!!
the lady's name is charlene jackson.
"i don't know here, but give her a call and check it out."
see you sunday!
you're not going to believe this.
i talked to amoco and they confirmed that i did the deal with them but they said thawe should just pay agave energy because tit's a complicated internal deal.
so we are both right..
i only wished amoco would have told me ahead of time.
bottom line- pay agave energy and not amoco
sounds like a good plan.
i can't wait to hear how it went in danbury.
sounds like the crra meeting went well.
kay
"bob, i hope all is well."
i appreciate your thoughts of including me and sending me emails but i need you to take me off your distribution list.
this type of emails are not allowed at enron and there are consequences with opening them.
i hope you understand.
mike
"yeah, i locked myself out of my house also."
really smart move!
i felt so terrible yesterday after our two nights of binge drinking.
i can't believe you stayed up partying until 6 in the morning.
you are crazy.
hey did we make some sort of deal on those tickets.
i vaguely remember something to that effect.
hi team.
i may be inviting you to a chat on thurs.
charlene my gut tells me that some of these folks we are hiring don't fit that well with the current strategic direction of enron (although i'm sure they are very high quality individuals).
"if its not too late, i wonder if we should slightly scale back the number of associates that we are attempting to hire."
i'm not sure that dave and i need that many individuals that are focused on international business.
regards john
i will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst meeting in january but i wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.
thanks for your front-end research on this.
it's too bad that the training provider can't be as responsive!
"in a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is an eternity."
sounds as if they are inflexible as well.
"our audience for this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away from the desk is not very workable either."
"after i get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, i may want to book them for september, although with a much smaller audience than would be desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery."
could i get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this decision?
we are at the mou stage.
need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and emphasized in a commercial meeting last friday.
"commercial leads at ena and global finance are out this week, so no progress at the moment."
the information i was given is that we want to get it done by the end of september.
how does this sound?
not interested.
sounds reasonable.
"martin, can you, please, call shu and provide him with information about ebs?"
"here are the people who handle confirms in houston: melissa ann murphy sharen cason kim hundl eb 3115 1400 smith street houston, texas 77002 hope that helps!"

"tuesday, may 30 mock draft no. 1: mihm's the word ? ?"
"by andy katz espn.com with the number of impact players available in the nba draft somewhere between few and none, this year's selections will be based on the potential of the underclassmen and the needs of the teams. nba scouts, general managers and player personnel directors are banking heavily on impressions made at private workouts and the chicago pre-draft camp june 6-9."
"because so many players are relatively close in terms of talent and opinions could change almost daily, this is the first of several projections we'll have on espn.com. a number of players still have work to do to earn first-round spots, but could easily sneak back on with impressive workouts and/or a strong showing in chicago."
any of these players could crack the bottom third of the draft over the next month.
the problem for underclassmen such as kapono and karcher is they must decide if it's worth the risk to stay in the draft.
underclassmen have until june 21 to pull their name out and still return to school.
"rush, el-amin and redd have all said they plan on staying in the draft, regardless of what happens."
espn.com checked with scouts around the league to get a feel about its mock draft and came up with these 29 selections for the week of may 22.
chris mihm mihm towered over much of the competition in college.
1
"new jersey -- chris mihm, 7-0, jr., texas: the nets need a center and could go with mihm or kenyon martin, but the pick here is mihm."
"the nets could either hold on to the pick and see if jayson williams plays next season, or deal it to the bulls for the no. 4 and no. 7 picks."
2
"vancouver - kenyon martin, 6-9, sr., cincinnati: the grizzlies would be getting a steal by grabbing martin at no. 2."
"he's the hardest-working player in the draft and, with a healthy leg, the most effective low-post scorer."
martin could play next to shareef abdur-rahim and bryant reeves.
"if the grizzlies aren't ready to go with martin, he makes for a tantalizing trade."
3
"los angeles clippers - stromile swift, 6-9, so."
", lsu: the clippers have already inquired about swift and see him as a potential small/power forward (which goes against lsu coach john brady's philosophy of how to use him defensively)."
"but, if swift knows he's going to the clips, he could opt to return to school."
"he has said he will not hire an agent, leaving the door open for a return."
4
"chicago -- joel przybilla, 7-0, soph."
", minnesota: the bulls need a center for their triangle offense."
"if they can't trade for mihm, przybilla is next in line."
he needs work but he has the skills to develop into a better offensive product than luc longley was during the bulls' championship runs.
5
"orlando -- marcus fizer, 6-8, jr., iowa state: the magic love darius miles but won't let fizer drop below no. 5 if he's available."
fizer gives the magic an inside scorer and a tough presence on the backboard that they lacked last season. doc rivers will fall in love with his work ethic.
6
"atlanta -- mike miller, 6-8, soph."
", florida: the hawks have been high on miller for a month and won't let him slide past them."
miles might be a better scorer but miller's versatility will win the hawks over at no. 6.
atlanta wants a small forward over a big guard.
7
"chicago -- darius miles, 6-9, hs, east st. louis (ill.): the bulls can package miles and przybilla to the nets or keep two players who could be solid players in the league."
miles might have more of an upside than tracy mcgrady.
tim floyd knows all about working with high school seniors and would have the patience to wait for miles to develop.
8
"cleveland -- iakovos tsakalidis, 7-1, greece: the cavs want size and the third-rated center in the draft is tsakalidis."
"the celtics covet him, too, but cleveland might not give them the chance because of the cavs' need for size with the uncertainty in their frontcourt."
reviews on tsakalidis are split -- either scouts love him or think he's too slow.
9
"houston -- courtney alexander, 6-5, sr., fresno state: alexander could go higher but not above six."
the rockets need scorers and alexander will produce during individual workouts.
"the choice of alexander, deshawn stevenson, dermarr johnson or morris peterson is hard to argue."
alexander can rise over a defense for a jump shot and has a pro game.
10
"orlando -- deshawn stevenson, 6-5, hs, washington union (fresno, calif.): the magic will take one of the two high school seniors with one of their three picks."
"if miles is gone, stevenson will be too by no. 11."
orlando has scouted him for months and rivers can afford to let stevenson mature without feeling pressured to play him next season.
11
"boston -- dermarr johnson, 6-9, fr., cincinnati: johnson can't slip past 11 with his lamar odom-like skills on the wing."
the celtics need size but can't let a scorer get past them in the draft.
"johnson learned defense from max good and bob huggins, so rick pitino's pressure defense shouldn't be much different."
12
"dallas -- mamadou n'diaye, 7-0, sr., auburn: trying to predict what don nelson will do is the most difficult thing in this mock draft."
but the mavericks need athleticism in the frontcourt.
they can't afford to go with a foreigner or a slower big man.
n'diaye fits here if he does well in workouts and in chicago -- if he shows.
13
"orlando -- mateen cleaves, 6-2, sr., michigan state: the magic have to take a point guard with one of their three picks, but no one is good enough to spend the no. 5 or no. 10 pick on."
cleaves is at the top of the point-guard list list -- and would fit rivers' style of play and coaching because of his leadership and toughness.
14
"detroit -- morris peterson, 6-6, sr., michigan state: the pistons won't let the local hero leave the state."
peterson gives them a scorer to go next to or in place of grant hill if he leaves via free agency.
"peterson could go higher -- if he's gone, the pistons will take alexander or johnson."
15
"milwaukee -- etan thomas, 6-9, sr., syracuse: the bucks want a power forward and thomas is fourth on their list behind martin, fizer and swift."
none will be available by the time they pick.
"thomas can give them a rebounder and defender, something they lacked in their playoff losses to the pacers."
16
"sacramento -- erick barkley, 6-1, soph."
", st. john's: the kings need a backup point to jason williams."
barkley could come in and wouldn't be under any pressure to perform immediately.
he's the no. 2 point guard behind cleaves.
17
"seattle -- quentin richardson, 6-6, soph."
", depaul: had richardson stayed, he would have probably been in the lottery next season."
"but he doesn't fit all of the teams' needs above, which is why he falls all the way to the sonics."
"he gives them another rebounding wing and a scorer to complement rashard lewis, if he re-signs."
18
"los angeles clippers -- keyon dooling, 6-3, soph."
", missouri: the clippers need a point guard but won't take one at no. 3."
dooling has the upside that some of the senior points don't carry into the draft.
but the potential of being a mid-teens draft pick may scare dooling into returning to school.
19
"charlotte -- jerome moiso, 6-10, soph."
", ucla: moiso could still slide up into the late lottery (maybe to dallas) but if he falls, the hornets will catch him."
moiso can play power forward or center for the hornets because of his ability to block shots and score from 12 feet in to the basket.
the hornets could use a frontcourt player or shooting guard in this draft.
20
"philadelphia -- jamal crawford, 6-6, fr., michigan: the sixers have already called on crawford's behalf and love him as a combo guard to come off the bench."
"crawford would likely stay in the draft if he's in the first round, regardless of where he's being picked."
21
"toronto -- craig """"speedy"""" claxton, 5-11, sr., hofstra: the raptors have already begun working out point guards and have claxton in their top five."
"if cleaves, barkley, dooling and crawford are all gone, claxton is the natural pick for the raptors."
22
"new york -- jamaal magloire, 6-11, sr., kentucky: the knicks took some heat for taking frederic weis last year."
"jeff van gundy wants tough, physical players."
magloire gets the nod over jason collier if the knicks go big.
magloire proved this season that he can play with passion in the post.
23
"utah -- hanno m""""tt""""l,, 6-9, sr., utah: the jazz can't go wrong with picking m""""tt""""l, from nearby utah."
"he can score from the wing, but he'll end up playing more inside because of his defensive limitations as a small forward."
"if m""""tt""""l, doesn't go to the jazz, he could slip out of the first round."
24
"chicago -- jeryl sasser, 6-7, jr., smu: the bulls have to find a point guard in this draft but can't go after one in the lottery."
the most intriguing point guard left could be sasser.
"he can play both guard positions, he's one of the better defenders in the draft and would give the bulls some versatility on the floor."
25
"phoenix -- jason collier, 7-0, sr., georgia tech: the suns need another big guy to go with luc longley -- either as a backup, or on the floor together."
collier has more offensive potential than many big men.
the suns have the luxury to allow collier a few years to develop into a nba center.
26
"utah -- chris carrawell, 6-6, sr., duke: the jazz need to add athleticism and fresh legs, either with carrawell or oklahoma state's desmond mason."
carrawell will probably get the nod because of his duke pedigree.
he could still go higher but his 'tweener status fits more as a late first-round pick.
27
"indiana -- donnell harvey, 6-8, fr., florida: harvey is getting rave reviews for his work ethic in workouts, and he didn't leave school early without some sort of assurance he could go in the first round."
the pacers have a history of going younger in the draft.
28
"portland -- soumaila samake, 7-2, cincinnati stuff (ibl): the blazers don't need much but could go with a wacky pick by taking the first player to jump from the fledgling ibl to the nba."
"samake has the size, shot-blocking skills and potential to be an nba center."
arvydas sabonis doesn't have many miles left in his legs.
29
"los angeles lakers -- desmond mason, 6-6, sr., oklahoma state: here's where any one of the bubble players could go, such as rush, karcher or stephens."
"but mason is a more polished, experienced player."
he gives the lakers an athlete on the wing who would fit in well in their system.

thanks for forwarding mail to me.
i apologize for the inconvenience of this.
"my current e:mail address is sally.beck@enron.com, as suggested within the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long name."
"however, my e:mail address prior to that was sbeck@ect.enron.com. that was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation i am sure."
"when ect became ena, i changed my e:mail address to drop the ect reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck."
so i can see why you would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated guess on the address or referencing my old card.
"since there are at least 2 sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between us?"
that might help eliminate confusion going forward.
what???
why did he call you?
ngpl related or trucking p&l related?

"""tino called today to report on their meetings with doe last week."
"tino, dennis langley, and their outside lawyer jim slattery met with bill richardson and doe staff to discuss the """"sole source"""" procurement approach to doe's obtaining an alternative power supplier for kirtland afb and sandia."
"tino reports that richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject only to doe review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the public interest."
"tino believes that the combination of significant native american involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price that is lower than doe's current pnm rates will satisfy the """"public interest"""" standard."
slattery is set to begin discussions with doe next week on the overall structure of dennis' proposal.
"i am surprised that dennis would go this far before hearing from us on the economics, but tino made it sound like the initial discussions would be fairly general--i.e., to explain to doe that the plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole thing in partnership with the isleta tribe, but without talking about specific economic issues."
sounds to me like dennis has richardson on board but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level doe staff people what a great deal this is for the tribes and therefore the government.
"tino, not surprisingly, is eager to see numbers and sit down to discuss them."
he suggested a meeting the first week of may in either houston or kc.
i asked tino whether he could get firmer numbers from doe than we currently have on (1) total electric and gas load (current and projected) for the afb and sandia and (2) actual price doe currently pays for gas and power.
"he didn't think he could get better information before the first week in may. on another related topic, through shelley corman's group  i got acquainted with a guy named tim beldon who runs the ena transmission capacity book for the western u.s., out of portland."
i talked with him for a few minutes about power flows and pricing in the n.m-arizona area and he seemed pretty knowledgable.
he has a transmission engineer on his team who is an expert in verifying utility claims of transmission constraints.
"apparently, ena buys and sells a lot of power in the four corners area and is pretty familiar with the transmission availabilty and power pricing situation up there."
"i didn't discuss with tim the specifics of the project we are looking at, but did tell him that kevin and steve were looking at a potential power plant load and trying to figure out how serious it is."
"kevin, if you guys think beldon could provide useful info on the cost and availability of firm and non-firm transmission for the surplus power out of albequerque up to four corners, please give him a call."
"it is ok to disclose to beldon what we are working on, but please inform him that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement and that further disclosure is improper."
please let me know whether a meeting with these guys the first week of may is doable.
thanks.

nepco's position sounds more typical for a cost plus contract.
is this a lump sum deal?
"if so, then i think nepco is taking an aggressive approach to both lol and retention."
"a 10% limit of liability during the warranty period is particularly aggressive, unless there are a lot of carve outs to the limit of liability, and other give-and-takes which make it make sense."
another factor which might make a difference is the treatment given to the ge contract.
"is nepco taking risk on ge performance, and is the dollar value of the ge equipment included in the price used to figure the % of liability?"
i'm glad to discuss this if i can be of help.

"*   in 12 and 13, enron has added new wording since the preceding issuance of this document."
"*   in 13, is all of this wording necessary and applicable."
"at the end of the first long sentence, the word """"turnkey"""" is used."
"of course, this is an equipment supply contract for ge."
"also, i believe the contracts do state what is in ge scope via clauses 1.27, 1.86 and 3.1."
"so, the last sentence is redundant."
"*   more importantly, these two clauses could be interpreted as establishing a geps/geioc consortium."
this is something ge had advocated as the approach in as single contract for tax purposes in mexico.
"ge can still go either way, although the single document approach is more straightforward (and that is what we initialed in your offices last month)."
enron wanted split contracts.
these clauses may undo what enron was attempting to achieve in this regard.
"*   in 14, which has been added by enron in the latest version of the consolidation agreement, the ge entities seem to be prevented from getting an extension of time under one contract if there is a problem with performance under the other."
"this is contrary to the words in the former enron clause 5, which has now been eliminated."
this clause 14 should be removed.
"*   regarding the """"swap"""" payments for tax purposes, to benefit both enron and ge: *   the amount paid to date on the monterrey unit, under the mou, is $25,101,733."
what ge proposes it to: *   revise the payment schedule for the contracts such that payments totaling this amount are due 2-3 days after contract signing.
"*   execute a separate letter, to be signed at the same time as the contracts, formally dissolving the mou."
the letter would call for ge to refund this same amount 2-3 days after receipt of the payment under the contracts.
"we need to draft this letter, which will hopefully be one page."
"the text of such a letter could include the following wording: """"pursuant to clause 30.3 of the now executed on and off shore contracts for this project, the mou dated ______ is made null and void."
"once the initial payment(s) called for in said contracts have been made, the monies in the amount of $25,101,733.00, which were paid under the mou will be refunded to (enron entity)."
""""" *   this would get the monies to the appropriate enron and ge entities."
"in a related matter, since the legal enron entity has changed, ge requests a parent guarantee (using form already shown in the contract(s))."
"regards, jeff smith<br>from:   brian d barto [mailto:brian.d.barto@enron.com] sent:   wednesday, may 31, 2000 11:01 am to:   jeffreye.smith@ps.ge.com; kay mann subject:   consolidation agreement << file: mac word 3.0 >> kay and jeff: please review and comment."
kay's comments are included and do not look unreasonable.
"jeff please edit this document and send back to kay and i to see what you are thinking about in the clause that used to be 11, now 10, i think."

"also, it is worrysome that pg&e has an argument that any dollars they spend on southwest must be reimbursed by tw under our agreement."
"they might feel free to pour money on southwest to keep them happy, even if southwest doesn't put much pressure on pg&e and as a customer relationship strategy , in the belief that it is enron money they are playing with."
can we do anything to keep pg&e honest on this?
"given all of the above,  is it our strategy to continue to manage this southwest gas problem as best we can as part of the broader pg&e problem?"

"""a charlotte, nc man, having purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars, insured them against fire, among other hazards."
"within a month, having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against the insurance company."
"in his claim, the man stated that the cigars were lost """"in a series of small fires""""."
"the insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion."
the man sued ... and won!
the ruling judge agreed that the claim was frivolous.
"he stated, nevertheless, that the man held a valid policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure against fire, without further defining what would be considered to be an """"unacceptable fire,"""" and was obligated to pay the claim."
"rather than endure a lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid the man $15,000 for the rare cigars he had lost in the """"fires""""."
"and now the good part...after the man cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of arson."
"with his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000.00 fine."""

dear citizens' assistance division: i live in the houston heights on the 800 block of cortlandt.
"for the 3 years i've lived there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on my street, have been blocked."
"any time it rains, we have standing water for several days afterwards."
i know that other streets in the heights have the same problem.
"i have heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper crop of mosquitos this summer."
standing water therefore poses a health concern for residents of the heights this summer.
does the city have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the heights?
"last year i called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, but got no response."
i hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication that the city of houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens.
any information you can provide would be appreciated.

"""hi kathleen, attached is an e-mail from mike bass."
my response follows.
"the issue with the county has been resolved here is a revised version """"the developer of the home depot/ target center on fm2094 is proceeding on plan."
the developers have requested that the texas department of transportation modify the new fm 2094 road to include three left turn lanes and a light at miller road.
the water district has agreed to also include the new center in their district as long as they pay any extra costs and meet certain other conditions.
the developers have agreed to pay the extra cost for both requests.
the city passed a resolution to support both requests by the developer and to express our intention to annex the property once the developer closes on the property and makes an annexation request of the city.
"the county and the developers have also agreed to share in resurfacing part, about 2100 feet, of hanson road- - a $200,000 cost."
this is a significant expense on top of all the other cost mentioned above.
but the project is proceeding as planned.
"the developers are still planning on closing on the property in the next few weeks."""

stinson the model looks great except when i changed an input and hit go it blew up.
maybe i'm doing something wrong.
one thing that i would like changed is that i want to make the swap product and product that settles against the 2nd last day.
so the role should happen on the second last day not the last day.
please change that if you can.

the emmisions book under kevin mcgowan will take a one time $4 million hit today.
this is to move the curves to better reflect the current market.
this hit will stay in the coal group but will be removed from its p/l from a performance measurement standpoint.
now that the curves are corrected i expect a focus on building our emmisions trading business in the following ways: 1.
understanding the fundamentals.
2
taking advantage of structural shifts that we forecast.
3
building more liquidity and being the primary market maker.
4
developing new traders.

these guys mainly care about the gas pipelines and that some of there projects are actually put on there lines to increase throughput.
these plants that they want on their lines are currently in construction or development.
their only operational plants are in colorado.
"they have a good generation team, but i fell that they do not want to be in the business of operating and maintaining the plants, just as long as somebody wants to put them along their lines."
"if you guys offered to buy their plants and projects, they would mainly care about price (cash and stock in the new company) and to put contracts in place for some of their projects to put on their lines."
hope this helps.

kyle there in nothing on this message.
the meeting don and i had with kinder/morgan to discuss his price risk management product went really well.
"we met with park schaper (cfo), anthony lannie (president of power group) and jay hopper (vp and general manager) was on the phone from denver."
they were very interested with regards to potentially replacing long term tolling agreements with this product.
enron could provide a five year toll and the product would begin in the sixth year through year 15 or 20.
we talked very little about their existing projects; little rock and michigan.
they do have all the permits for the little rock site and are moving forward with the michigan site and still do not have any tolling agreements in place for those projects.
the ball is currently in their court and were going to get back with scot with respects to the projects and with tom on the prm product.
please let me know if you have any questions with this matter.

release.
i suppose we would need to use cap.
"release if the termination or reduction of their mdq was a sham designed to get the capacity from nmng to another shipper, however."
i would propose one change to par. 3 just to make the discount more clear.
the par. talks about primary delivery points but is silent on primary receipts.

here is the draft letter agreement.
we are still discussing it with ecs and can make whatever changes are appropriate.
note that the letter agreement ties back to article 6 of the compression services agreement.
"that article, you may recall, is where ecs agreed to create a computerized system that would monitor continental divide's electric system utilization and warn when their system peaks were occurring and then automatically take the compressor offline (subject to manual override) so we and ecs could avoid peak period demand charges."
"instead of creating such a system, which apparently turned out to be mostly a manual system anyway, ecs is going to pay us a monthly fee to monitor cd's system peaks ourselves and decide when we need to get off line."
"the load management service has to do with operational management of the load we place on cd's electric system, and is not a jurisdictional gas transportation or storage service."
note that the service goes on for 10 years (as required by the accountants' 10 year amortization rule) and thus may be vulnerable to scrutiny and potential revenue crediting in tw's 2007 rate case.
any way to avoid that?

hi!
i thought the conference was pretty good.
"i had a great room, with a huge jacuzzi tub."
did anyone get promoted?
"no one said anything about promotions, so i figured nothing interesting happened in that regard."

i'm with you.
"i told my wife i thought it would be a 3 touchdown game, but a 49 point margin is unacceptable."
i was at the game and it was as if the texas coaches got a bunch of guys from the frat houses this week and put together a game plan on saturday morning before kickoff.
"they were out of position, slow, unmotivated, and flat out not prepared to play."
"i like brown and actually think he is a good fit, but at some point you actually have to coach."
i lay this all at his feet.
obviously the coordinators bear some major responsibility as well.
i really don't know what to expect for the remainder of the season.
they obviously are not as bad as they showed on saturday.
"but the fact remains that they are capable of playing that poorly on any saturday, and i really did not think that with this defense they could be humiliated."
i was very wrong.
something has to change.
the fact is they are 3-5 in the last 8 games.
and were favored in all but one.
lack of talent is no longer an excuse.
i think the entire remainder of the season hinges on this saturday.
"if they play as poorly as they have all season (they have beaten 3 terrible teams, and lost to a bad one) against colorado, they will lose and i could see them finishing at 6-5 and even 5-6 not out of the question."
"for this reason, i think that this could be the biggest game of brown's tenure at ut."
what do you think?
"matt, attached is the file phillip asked me to send you."

dr. harris: i would like to thank you for personally taking the time to closely review my application.
though i am disappointed with the results i am still determined to attend the texas graduate school of business next year.
"i understand how competitive the process has become, but i felt that with my work experiences, recommendations, personality, extracurricular activities, etc. that this would compensate for my disability."
"after talking with professors titman, ronn, brown and jemison, i was sure that the school was the right place to get the education i was looking for."
"i am still certain that the school is the best place for getting a great graduate-level education, so i want you to know that i am going to do whatever it takes to get in next year."
i plan on taking two or three graduate level finance courses at the university of houston this summer and fall to demonstrate to the admissions committee that i can compete at the graduate level.
i also plan on retaking the gmat test.
"due to my disability, this will be a monumental task; but i am determined to prove to the committee that i can be successful at the texas graduate school of business."
i would like to come down to austin this spring to meet with you to further discuss my application file and to personally meet you.
"if you think of anything else i can do to strengthen my overall application file for next year, please let me know."
take care and hope to hear from you soon.

this is the last one and probably the best - near smu (connected by rail to downtown and near greenville - another bar area).

yeah dude i bet you got a lot of operational management and statistical business analysis as well as spreadsheet work with that poli sci degree.
at least the group projects will enable you to meet some people.
are you still thinking about getting a job tending bar or something or do you think you won't have enough time?
good to hear you are coming up in a few weeks.
i would definetly like to go out with you guys on thursday night.
that friday night i already have plans but maybe we can go play some golf on friday afternoon.
i played in a tournament with some people at work out at the reserve last week.
boy is that a great course.
our tee time was at 7:30 and we had all been out partying until 2am the night before.
so needless to say we weren't feeling so great come tee time.
however the beers were free for the tournament and come about 7:45 we were drinking again and feeling a little better.
we all played really well and got fourth plance out of 42 teams.
"we won these sweater vests, a sand wedge, and a nike bag."
there was a free bar-b-que afterward with more free beer.
so by about 2pm we were all totally schmatered.
it was a good time and i was playing with the guy that i want to work for in real time trading.
he and i are going to lunch next week to discuss but he mentioned to me during golf that he wants me to work for him which would be a great opportunity so things are going a little better at work.
anwyay let me know what your plans are for the week you come.
i will catch you later man.
11:31:00 am<br>and we're coming to houston!
yeah!
i am really looking forward to our trip to houston this year!
"got you message over thanksgiving, hope you had a great (long) weekend!"
we stayed in town and helped out at the santa monica civic center then tried to find a turkey dinner to eat... nothin' like eatin' at a restaurant for thanksgiving... :(
we are planning to arrive in houston on thursday the 21st and return back to la on tuesday the 26th.
we'd love to get together with you (and your beau?) on friday if you're still in town and are available!
mark and i love to trek downtown and see how the rest of the city lives outside of north houston.
let me know if that works for you.
hope you're having a good week.

i will let joe know that you received his care package.
"i didn't have this on my calendar, lexi, because i wasn't on the list for this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy."
"my husband has a commitment away from home for wednesday night, and with the children in school already, i can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two year-old during prime homework hours."
patti has some names that i have suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.
"very few of the names on your e:mail message were on the recruiting strategy schedule that you handed out, so i would be surprised if any of these folks have this on their calendars."
you may need some of the names that patti has for you.
"i have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and i am in the process of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work for me."

"the gas spec (oil ng hedge) book will show a mtd variance of $819,000 today."
"when the power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not divide by 1,000."
therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.
"however, john lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included in today's daily p&l on the ngp&l. if you have any questions feel free to give me a call."
"thanks, robin"

one more question regarding all three plants for allegheny.
thanks ben
i'll respond later.
i'm sure that many of you are aware that there has been a great deal of activity lately related to enron's evaluation of possible acquisitions.
john goodpasture's group has kept a large number of et&s people engaged in looking at a number of potential deals.
"while these deal evaluation projects have become routine around here, we all must remember that these projects are extremely confidential."
"even after a potential seller has announced that it is up for sale, the fact that enron is looking at a potential deal, as well as any of our internal analysis of the deal, remains strictly confidential."
i realize that many of you have ongoing business relationships with employees of some of the companies that we have evaluated or may evaluate in the future.
"if you find yourself in such a situation, and a business contact at the target company asks whether enron is evaluating the contact's company or assets, the only appropriate response is that enron personnel are not permitted to discuss potential acquisitions."
please be aware that the confidentiality agreements that we typically sign as part of the acquisition evaluation process preclude any communication by enron people with employees of the target company.
"if you have any questions or concerns regarding this requirement, please do not hesitate to give me a call."
thank you for your assistance.

"mail this article to a friend danbury, conn.--(business wire)--nov. 2, 2000-- new, specialized applications for direct fuelcell(tm) power plants fuelcell energy, inc."
"(nasdaq: fcel, news, msgs) announced the award of contracts for two new power plants using the company's direct fuelcells(r) (dfc(r)) for coal mine and remote location applications."
"the first contract is for a $5.4 million project with the u.s. department of energy (doe) national energy technology laboratory (netl) for the design, construction and operation of a 250 kw dfc, utilizing coal mine methane gas, at the harrison mining corporation coal mine in cadiz, ohio."
"the second contract, for $100,000, is from the u.s. coast guard research and development center in groton, connecticut for a remote location, 3 kw fuel cell power system, using methanol for fuel."
"it is scheduled to be installed during the second quarter of 2001 at the cape henry lighthouse at fort story, near virginia beach, va."
"coal mine methane: cost-free fuel reduces emissions fuelcell energy was selected for the coal mine methane emission reduction project to demonstrate the ability of the dfc to generate electricity, using coal mine methane emissions that otherwise escape into the atmosphere."
costs for the three-year program will be shared equally by the doe and fuelcell energy.
"as a result, in addition to the environmental benefits of reducing emissions, the cost of electricity produced from coal mine methane is reduced by using a fuel that is essentially free. """
"""the doe has been supporting the development of fuel cells for more than two decades,"""" said mark c. williams, fuel cell product manager for netl. """
"""this application to coal mine methane effectively combines efficient power generation with a solution to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions."""
""" according to fuelcell energy, 75% of the world's coal mine methane emissions from active and abandoned coal mines comes from the top six countries with coal mining operations."
"a total of approximately 1,000 megawatts of fuel cell power could be generated using coal mine methane from the two sources."
"the u.s., alone, has approximately 300 megawatts of unutilized coal mine methane capacity."
"at an estimated $1,000 kw, the 1,000 mw worldwide potential for fuelcell energy fuel cell power plants is equivalent to a $1.0 billion market. """
"""the use of coal mine methane to power direct fuelcells will result in benefits for all concerned,"""" said jerry d. leitman, president and ceo of fuelcell energy. """
"""coal mine methane is a greenhouse gas which can be remediated."
"by using it to fuel a dfc power plant, a customer turns a liability into an asset that gets rid of a polluting gas and produces electric power in an environmentally responsible fashion."
an important milestone for the company is to identify prospective early-adopter markets.
"the coal mine methane market provides a virtually free fuel source to operate the fuel cells, facilitating early adoption by energy users."""
""" remote power: clean energy where the wires end the u.s. coast guard research and development center has awarded fuelcell energy a $100,000 contract to provide a 3 kw dfc power plant at the cape henry lighthouse, for a field test at the lighthouse to demonstrate fuel cell capabilities at remote sites."
"the coast guard operates several hundred unattended power systems at remote site communication stations, radio navigation stations, weather stations, and aids to navigation such as lighthouses, structures, and buoys."
stand alone fuel cell power systems offer efficiency and environmental advantages for remote site operation.
"the methanol fuel allows for simpler, more compact process equipment for fuelcell energy's direct fuelcell plant compared to other fuel sources. """
"""this demonstration project by fuelcell energy is the first application of fuel cells at a remote, unmanned site in a marine environment"""", said walt lincoln, project manager of the u.s. coast guard research and development center. """
"""we're interested in the potential of the fuel cell because of its promise of reduced maintenance and greater reliability compared to other systems."""
""" """"in addition to the unattended applications for the coast guard, there are other potential remote power applications in operation around the world, such as pipeline monitoring, microwave relay stations, and numerous other communications and recreational uses that could be served by fuel cells,"""" said leitman."
"using carbonate fuel cell technology, the dfc(r) power plant produces high efficiency energy through an electro-chemical reaction, rather than through combustion."
"this method of producing power gives energy users the option of producing electricity on site with the assurance of lower emissions, less noise and with shorter timeframes required for the permitting process."
"about fuelcell energy, inc."
"fuelcell energy, inc. - www.fce.com - formerly energy research corp., is a leading developer of carbonate fuel cell technology for stationary power generation."
the company's direct fuelcell technology eliminates external fuel processing to extract hydrogen from a hydrocarbon fuel.
"this results in a product whose cost, combined with high efficiency, simplicity and reliability, results in product advantages for stationary power generation."
"fuelcell energy, based in danbury, ct is developing direct fuelcell(r) power plants with nominal ratings of 300 kw, 1.5 mw and 3 mw.."
the company has been developing dfc(r) technology for stationary power plants with the u.s. department of energy through the national energy technology laboratory (netl).
"the netl's advanced fuel cell research program is focused on developing a new generation of high performance fuel cells that can generate clean electricity at power stations or in distributed locations near the customer, including hospitals, schools, data centers and other commercial and industrial applications."""

us gas liquidity eol has allowed enron to simultaneously provide internal and external customers with realtime  markets in many of the physical and financial products that we trade.
the ability of all customers to execute trades and receive instantaneous confimations has resulted in rapidly growing volumes and growing customer participation.
one of the benefits of this system is to allow all customers access to the market prices rather than being funnelled through third party brokers.
enron has committed to providing both depth of volume and tight bid/offer spreads.
this committment has been main driver of the growth in volume since rollout last nov.29.
transparency the existence of our two way market has removed all doubt about the firmness of bids and offers.
we will trade on the price and volume on our bid and offer.
the growing volumes over our system has lessened our dependance on the sometimes unreliable broker served market.
many of our customers and competitors now use eol as an information source as well as a trading vehicle.
eol is the only service that provides free real time information on as many traded markets in the physical and financial worlds.
we have no competition in this regard.
this aspect of eol has been helpful to the smaller customers that are not primarily trading operations.
deal flow as the market maker on this system we do derive some tangible trading benefits.
we are collecting the bid/offer spread on our transactions and over time this results in a direct bottom line benefit.
enron's market share of financial tranactions will also increase overtime as we have become the easiest and most reliable way to transact in the market.

facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month ( as long as the deals are in the wh portfolio).
this value should not be given to sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.

for further info contact vance taylor.

"so, what is it?"
just wanted to give everyone a update on where we were with all the site visits to the plants.
"as you already know, site visits begin this thursday and runs through the 27th of october, so its a pretty tight schedule."
"in terms of who will be specifically covering which plants, this is the following: gleason will be dave kristich; lincoln will be fred mitro; and wheatland will be ross newlin."
"these guys will cover the site visits the next two weeks, but everyone else may be asked to fill in for them if needed."
"while on the site visit, please make sure that the companies do not take any pictures and they are only allowed to talk to you or the plant manager."
most of the companies will probably be there for only a couple of hours per day.
i hope all of this is clear and if you have any questions about scheduling please give me a call.
"again, thank you for your help with these issues."

is there an ability to let sabine or irvin run with vitro and get your attention on this item asap.
i know that the monterrey project is eating into your time.  do we need to augment your resources?

the koch midstream gas  joe nominates is on a lateral that can only be delivered into tennessee pipeline which is a east desk pipeline - i believe the texas desk asked that we be respnsible for this volume.

"""ena has a put to coh (deal 213360) for up to 10,000 dth/day."
this deal was in the system for december and i just took it to 0 for the whole month.

"2.3  we need an out in case we don't commence construction/achieve commercial operation as a result of buyer's action/inaction, and the term """"breach"""" should include failure to timely perform any of buyer's obligations under any of the agreements."

4.6 note:  3.3 refers to alternate sources and market sources; 4.6 refers to the wholesale market.
"we should pick a term, define it, and use it throughout."
"8.1 (c)  replace """"covenant"""" with """"obligation"""", and follow with """"(other than payment)""""."

is there any reason the damage waiver can't be absolute?
"does the sole and exclusive language in 4.8 need to be conspicuous, or is it ok?"
"9.1  is the demand charge included in the invoice, or is it due without an invoice?"
"10.1 on the third line, shouldn't the second """"seller"""" be """"buyer""""?"
15
no mediation.
16.1  delete oral amendment language.
"exhibits: a. megawatts, heat  rate to be confirmed."
"heat rate believed to be 10,600."
deleted bracketed language about implied cost of fuel from alternate source energy.
start up costs:  $500.
emergency start up to be addressed later.
could we schedule a conference call for friday or monday to discuss any questions/issues.
please let me know your availability.
"thanks, kay"""
"anne,  we would like to know the p&l for trading california gas this year for physical only."
"please run a report summarizing the p&l at socal topock, pg&e topock, socal ehrenberg, ca production, pg&e topock, malin, etc.  we will then need to notify john lavorado of the results."
"thanks, mike"
i will talk with don about a good time to meet and let you know.
an application called ap data viewer.
"accounts payable uses it to retrieve status on document such as invoice payments, wires, payment requests, etc.... i've just spoken to pam and i think i'm requesting the right thing but using the wrong form."
will you please reject this so i can start all over?
"bob:  per your request, here is the rundown on patti's activities for august and beyond."
1
we calculated the amount we made on her experience in handling el paso's transport to be close to $1 million/ month.
2
i could not even begin to calculate the amount made just by having her here.
"if patti had just quit with everyone else gone, the amount lost on el paso would be huge, including loss of credibility on our part with our customers."
the exact amount would be close to $1 million/month i would think.
3
the spreads out west have been huge this summer.
we were able to take advantage of this because patti was here to do the scheduling during a very difficult time.
4
"when i was out for the entire month of august, patti was not only holding down a desk that usually three people handle, but was also filling in on management duties."
5
"patti worked 14 weeks in a row, including weekends, without taking a day off."
"she worked at least 12 hours a day during this time, handling several different jobs at a time."
6
the exact value of what patti did is hard to determine.
i would estimate that her presence here and stepping in to help out was woth about $5 million to the desk.
thanks for following up on this.
i like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week.
joe just told me the other day that he got the check.
i never saw it.
it came when i was out of town.

"when considering these issues, please assume that the city would own and annex the land, and lease it to an enron entity."
"we will need the gas by next march or april, so time is critical."
"should the gas company decline, what is the appeal process and how long can it be expected to take?  do you  have any suggestions for expediting the process?"

"""you asked whether current contract approval procedures require the marketers to get legal's approval on all transportation contracts."
"the answer is no. if you look at the et&s policy on authority to grant transportation and storage discounts (i can fax it to you if you don' t have it), there is a column for """"pre-approved terms"""" and one for """"non pre-approved terms""""."
contracts that are not on a pre-approved form always have to have the legal dept's approval.
contracts on pre-approved forms with a total discount (for the entire contract term) of less than $1.2 million do not need legal's approval; those above the threshold do.
does that make sense?
as far as i know our marketers have been following this.
"i spoke with tk and she is aware of the policy, and she is also aware that she needs to show me any contract that deviates from our standard language."
she has also discussed this with steve harris recently to make sure he's comfortable with the policy.
"if we need to discuss this further please let me know."""

"the northern cases he is involved in are not really  """"gisb matters."""

gisb is a freestanding entitity and his representation does not equate to representation of enron so he could claim that his only client interest to worry about is gisb itself.
"as long as he does not take positions in northern cases that are inconsistent with what gisb wants, he's technically ok."
i suspect he'd argue that his work in the northern docket is completely consistent with gisb's objective of achieving world domination.
"this was my from the hip analysis when jay first showed up in our cases, so i may have missed something."

the following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the dpr over the next two weeks.
"i know that books run in calgary, houston, and portland will be calculated and officialized on friday, december 22nd for trading that day."
"the current plan is not to publish the dpr for december 22nd on tuesday, december 26th, but to wait until the first enron official business day to do so (i.e. wednesday, december 27th)."
"that will work as long as trading results for friday, december 22nd are not dramatic."
"please leave a voice mail message after calcing the books on friday, december 22nd for chris abel (x33102) to give him trading results by commodity for december 22nd."
"if there are dramatic results, chris may produce a preliminary and rough dpr on tuesday, december 26th with the information that you provide."
"for locations that will not calc and officialize books on friday, december 22nd, you will still need to contact chris to give him your best estimate of trading results."

"i'm ok with the language, but i want to make sure everyone is ok on the concept."
"when we left this (unless there have been subsequent conversations with ecs that i wasn't a part of) we rejected courtney's proposal to reduce our up front payment by $500,000."
"he was to come back and propose a monthly quantity of gas to be paid over the term of the contract that would equate to the $500,000, but i don't recall that we agreed to it."
did we intend to leave the issue open for more horsetrading on the amount of a haircut ecs should take or were we content to cover ecs at 100 cents on the dollar?
"i am advised that the btu number in the letter would allow ecs to get the full $500,000 of up front value."
rod and steve--this one is up to you and i think its totally a question of whether we want to argue for some more $$ because i can't think of any other open issue with ecs on this or any other deals that we might be able to trade.

tom has come to a decision on what to do with the ubiquitous accrual value.
60% of this value should be credited to greg's transport expense on a monthly basis.
"tom, in turn, will cover ed on this portion of the expense."
"for example: accrual value comes out to be $300,000 for the month of april."
ed's p&l is net unchanged from all of the above.

"""here's the latest tino-gram: 1."
tino's environ.

the isleta is interested in granting dennis row/lease for the power plant as well as the pipeline.
the power plant could be located on isleta land adjacent to the south boundary of the scandia reservation.
"thus, the power plant could be connected to doe's existing powerline infrastructure without ever leaving the isleta and doe land.  pnm would not be necessary to move power to doe."
unclear to me whether this approach would give the power plant optimal access to the power grid for sales of surplus power.
(maybe  this could be done through doe to an interconnect with pnm on the scandia reservation?) 3.
"dennis is using jim slattery, an ex law partner of mine in dc (and ex dem. u.s. congressman from kansas), as his primary contact with  bill richardson at doe."
"my recollection is that jim does have a good relationship with richardson, so this seems very likely to be effective."
"tino reports that """"doe is ok with the deal"""" and the next step is negotiating the power contract itself."
tino said that doe is aware that the capital for the project will not come from the tribe so the tribe's interest will be fairly thin.
it is unclear exactly how much indian ownership dennis and slattery promised doe.

tino has run into a power plant consultant named jack maddox who says he's working on a 230mw plant to be located west of belen.
"tino thinks he's working for the laguna tribe, but wanted us to find out who is planning a big power plant out there."
is this ours?  pnm's?
el paso?
"finally, the next key step is obviously the economics."
"based on what tino told me, i'm convinced that dennis and tino don't have a real good sense of how much $$$ might be in this deal."
they are groping a bit and our initial analysis of the numbers will likely carry a lot of weight.
how are those efforts coming?
thanks.

"""melissa, as you know, as of jan 01, 2000 the wellhead portfolio has been segregated from the rest of hplc's physical portfolio."
"as a result of this segregation, it has become much easier to analyze and manipulate this data so that monthly """"accrual value"""" can be determined."
"this analysis has resulted in the realization that the wellhead potfolio creates approximately $275,000 of accrual value per month."
"the main drivers of this accrual value are deals that have rolled into evergreen status, accrual term deals,  actual volumes greater than booked, half cent bid to mid spread, incorrect markings, and value withheld from mtm because of accrual costs."
"of the above, greg sharp will receive value associated with evergreen/accrual deals, actual volumes greater than or less than booked, and deals incorrectly marked."
tom will keep value associated with his half cent bid to mid and accrual value needed to pay accrual costs (such as gas quality issues).
the breakout of this value has been on average 60% to greg and 40% to tom.

"guys, joe sutton had passed down an opportunity that probably fits your capabilities better than ours."
"in a nutshell, a consultant on retainer by mass. general hospital in boston, part of the healthcare partners system, is desiring a steam and electric contract."
"the steam load could be as high as 500,000 pd of steam and 22 mw of power."
i think they are very open to an energy partner to manage all their needs perhaps including the six or seven other hospitals that hp controls in the nation.
the consultants name is joe petrowski (203)451-9747.
i spoke to him yesterday afternoon and promised that one of you would be in contact.
joe is a big fan of enron's and could see the logic of a more robust product like the full energy outsourcing versus just a steam agreement.
it may be a good lead into the health care segment.

it ain't tying if we aren't restricting access to the service--we are just offering selective discounts.

time to break out some of the old plays?
<br>enron north america corp.
thanks in advance for agreeing to speak at the global operations controller forum.
there will be approximately 30 enron business controllers present at the meeting.
"all have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following enron entities:  enron north america, enron europe, enron south america, enron global markets, enron industrial markets, enron broadband services and enron energy services."
"attendees will be here from houston, calgary, tokyo, sydney, london and new york (metals business-maybe!)."
attached for your reference is the agenda.
"there may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group."
"you are scheduled to address the group as follows: date:  monday, october 23, 2000 time:  3:30 pm place:  the warwick hotel the versailles room - 12th floor 5701 main street houston,  tx  77005 i have noted that your topic will be assessing, measuring and managing market risk."
any references that you could make to the importance of information flow between rac and operations would be great to cover.
feel free to offer up a challenge to the group.
i hope that you will be able to join us for the tour of enron field and for dinner at ruggles center field terrace on monday evening.
the tour is at 6:00 and dinner is at 7:00.

there is ample opportunity for all three of us in the hot air business.

dave: just wanted to remind you about the call i received from paul cavicchi with tractebel.
he was calling to ask about an extention to the bidding on the assets.
i basically said that there are no extentions except for bids that are strong bids that come in on monday or tuesday of next week.
"he sounded a little disappointed that they got the book so late, but still seemed interested in the assets."

we are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all commodities front to back.
"we found a few minor issues, primarily reports with report dates that were incorrect."
the content and underlying calculations in the reports were correct.
these were really just query and formatting issues.
all were quick fixes of five minutes or less.

jeff: sorry for my cryptic answer in regards to the lng deal on friday; i was a bit confused by the question.
"in terms of the gas pricing, this is a deal that should be done."
market conditions are very conducive to hedging a fair amount of the gas.
"obviously, a deal this size would require enron to wear a considerable amount of the risk in the short term, but the risk-reward of the position looks very favorable."
i am certainly willing to sign off on this deal around the $3.00 level.

"""cedric,   as a follow-up to our meeting,  below are a few comments and ideas regardin= g  the net works piece of the analyst presentation."
"i know i sent you a lot of data and presentations, here are a few pages in=   the various presentations that i think may be appropriate for the  presentation (or pieces of them) including:  ?"
why enron? ?
recent enron ecommerce experience ?
lessons learned ?
business strategy ?
target market criteria ?
enron today/enron tomorrow here are a couple of other thoughts and ideas.
we need to emphasize our new businesses outside the energy business  (obvious).
clickpaper.com will be out and live just before the analyst  meetings.
this is very exciting and could take the industry by storm  (eventually).
"especially with jeff=01,s comments with the analysts."
this=   should be emphasized with the metals piece.
"the concept is that here are 2=   new areas where enron is going to change the """"old economy"""" businesses and=   industries."
clickpaper will have real time pricing which is different than=   all the other 15 existing sites.
all of the others are charging 3% fees fo= r  matching buyers and sellers in a bulletin board or auction type of  transactions.
"we will also have that functionality (and will charge 1% or $= 0  (we=01,ll update you later) but will also have an eol type of real time pri= cing  component (this piece will be free)."
this piece will not be ready for july=   25th but will be announced publicly and in final development stages (should=   be out by end of 3rd qtr.).
i believe that the link with net works with bo= th  paper and metals is very important for providing a more complete picture th= an  just metals alone.
"also for your information, we are working on 2  acquisition deals that will be coming out soon, 1 is to buy a mill and coul= d  be announced next week, which will also clarify and add to the story since = we  will have access to physical pulp and paper."
paper must be an important  piece of the presentation.
greg piper is the md for clickpaper and he can=   answer any other questions and fill you in and answer more questions.
he c= an  be reached at ext. 36635.
"also, on the """"target markets"""" page, i would reorder;  put lumber underneath=   pulp and paper and think about separating the others as potential markets."
"=   that way we could actually check off the top 3 as """"done"""" and the others are=   in """"incubation"""" and examination stages."
"please draft up your initial thoughts on these items and send me the latest=   version and i=01,ll add additional commentary."
i will be in all next week.
"thanks, mike"""

i couldn't agree with you more.
mike missed the point of our phone call this week.
it was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette!
the point was ownership of an integration process and deadlines that were missed.
and how telling that when asked bluntly about his comfort level with controls for us operations that mike's response was a deferral to marcelo.
i have a one-hour conference call set up with mike tomorrow.
this is one of the things that we will discuss.  --sally

"lisa bills and i spoke concerning this transaction, and what kind of document we can put in front of peoples at this time."
here are the highlights from our conversation: enron can't enter into a binding commitment to purchase the equipment without putting the moore project on the balance sheet.
"therefore, either westlb needs to enter into the agreement with peoples or enron can enter into an option agreement."
"there is room in the westlb facility for the turbines; however, rac needs to approve the purchase."
lisa advises that transaction support (herman or roger) needs to buy in as well.
"i understand we would like to present a binding agreement to peoples tomorrow, however, this appears to be problematic given the need to keep the moore project off the balance sheet."
i'm available to discuss this.

hi mary anne - i am responding to your message on behalf of mike mcconnell.
mike is in singapore at this time and we are not sure if he will be successful in dialing up to catch up on his e-mail correspondence.
thank you very much for your message.
we solicit one time lump-sum contributions to jdf rather than per mile.
"in addition, we collect the pledges for the walk - rain or shine."
the reason of course is that our main goal is to raise money to find a cure and we would prefer that weather or other elements beyond our control not impact our ability to raise funds.
"however, we have a great time on walk day and we have a lot of people turn out for the walk."
this year we are anticipating in excess of 500 walkers.
the total amount of donations that are turned in by enron employees are very generously matched dollar-for-dollar by the enron foundation.
"therefore, the matching forms are not necessary."
if you happen to be in houston on november 5th we would enjoy having you join us for the walk.
"if you care to make a donation, it may be mailed to mike at the following address: mike mcconnell enron global markets 1400 smith street, eb 3328 houston, tx  77002 if you donate $"

"""yesterday jeff fawcett, lee ferrell and i met with dynegy marketing and legal/regulatory representatives regarding tw transport options."
overall the meeting was very positive.
we had nothing but encouraging remarks from the marketing representatives.
"however, the regulatory people (sarah tomalty, ed ross) had a couple of issues."
the biggest issue is a marketing affiliate concern.
apparently dynegy is on a crusade at ferc to place further limits on deals pipelines can do with their marketing affiliates.
"they have run into situations in which pipelines (examples:  koch, el paso) have blatantly favored their marketing affiliates to the extent that dynegy cannot even do deals with them."
"(in fact, one of the problems with koch has been koch's price option deals with its affiliate.)  the perception is that the affiliates, by using """"funny money,"""" can always make themselves the highest bidder, with a net benefit to the entire organization (pipeline + affiliate)."
"the remedy dynegy is proposing is to require a marketing affiliate, if it is the highest bidder, to credit back the difference between the price it pays and the price offered by the next highest bidder."
the presumption is that the affiliate has an unfair advantage because it is able to pay above market value in order to get the capacity.
"dynegy's proposal would encourage affiliates to pay """"real"""" dollars."
"while it emphasized its belief that tw does not favor its marketing affiliates, dynegy would like for us to include in our filing some limitation on options transactions with marketing affiliates."
"it is likely that other pipelines will file for the ability to sell options once ferc approves our filing, and dynegy would like for this type of protection to be part of the precedent set by our filing."
"ed hinted that ferc may be considering a divestiture requirement for marketing affiliates, and that pipelines can avoid this extreme result by voluntarily limiting their transactions with affiliates."
"shelley, i know you've discussed this issue with ed already and our reactions were the same."
basically we politely told dynegy that we don't believe we're part of the problem and that we are therefore not inclined to unnecessarily disadvantage our company by further limiting ena's ability to do business with tw.
we can probably expect an intervention with comments or a limited protest addressing the issue.
the other regulatory question was whether we intend to file each option deal as a negotiated rate.
"my analysis of this issue is that since we're proposing the option fee as part of the transport rate, options would always be a type of negotiated rate and would need to be filed."
"if you think this is not the right answer, please let me know because we need to decide it before we file the tariff sheets."
sarah's question seemed to be more one of curiosity rather than a basis for protest.
"like the indicated shippers, dynegy appeared interested in an all-customer meeting to discuss the service."
jeff and the rest of the commercial group are looking further into whether and when we would have such a meeting.
"if you have any questions or concerns please let me know."""

your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th best rb for the 30th receiver?
i'll check around here.
are we still getting a demand charge bill from equitrans for contract 270?
"i am still estimating about $5,000 per month."
"i will talk to meathead - """"brandon"""" about playing."
that sounds like a good idea.
i guess you will be taking the day off?
are you trying to make me blind like you?????
"i will look forward to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, with effective exception reporting."
"we are on the 32nd floor now (thru the glass door and turn right), if your badge still works."
"or, give me a call from the lobby and i'll come get you."
"would you like me to invite anyone else to go with us (carlos, lauri, etc)?"
it doesn't matter to me.

kevin i agree.
"if we ultimately trade out of toronto, the p/l responsibility will probably role into you."
it looks like we were trying to close garret tripp (associate) to move to toronto and start looking at this stuff.
"if he is going, you should meet with him before he goes."
"john, i am writing to you regarding the management of the london research group."

i would like to change my parking contract from the clay garage to the allen center garage.
"thank you, robin"
"erin, here are a couple of responses."
please rewrite as you see fit.
mike 1.
agriculture.
we are currently looking at and studying the industry.
we have traded some commodities as well.
we believe that there may be large opportunities to apply the enron model to the agriculture industry.
we have spent quite a bit of time an effort and are currently developing our strategy.
this is very early in development but we have high expectations in this area.
i don't feel comfortable going into more detail at this time.
gary hickerson is responsible enron's ag business.
2
rail.
we are looking at numerous opportunities in the rail and transportation businesses.
i haven't seen a lot on the electricity piece of rail.
it is an interesting concept and one that we will look at.
dan reck is now responsible for looking at transportation opportunities in the us.

please set up deal 245855.
"thanks brenda, this is for tetco contract 892590 - the last contract on the email you sent me."
"""guys, this is my first cut on who i would want to be in this group."
i think this is an important exercise on a couple different fronts.
"we need to bring more people """"in"""" which should increase their accountability for ena results overall, improve communication and teamwork and provide a platform to evaluate future leaders."

"decisions, decisions ...they are tough for her."
i suppose that if she wants others to host the shower that we can just split the cost of a couple of packs of diaper pins and then focus on eating all the sandwiches and cake that we can!
"(do you think that we will be invited?)  that really sounds ugly, and i don't mean it to."
"i think that your idea was a great one, but if she has too many offers we can probably just as easily be guests."
let me know when the deliberation process is completed!
i knew we would have to address this eventually.
ces is long 3600/month in tgt z4 at cg&e.  i showed them a $2.66 bid for tomorrow.
"before i had worked up the price, ces decided to take the gas into cgas at lebanon."
this gets real messy.
is there any way we can refuse this?
"at first, i was thinking we would have to do this."
"now, i don't like the idea because it will be really messy in the summer."

"i had an interesting conversation with mark courtney today, this time about something that doesn't cost us money."
he has gained a good bit of experience on transmission availability in nw new mexico from the gallup electric contract negotiation.
his take on transmission constraints is consistent with what kevin and i had suspected:  alb. is a load pocket and the prevailing flow is west to east into alb.  constraints only affect west to east flows and a generator in alb. could always move power to four corners by displacement.
"courtney has worked with an ena transmission guy named steve walton who apparently has more experience with the 230kv transmission lines that had the problem that led to the recent blackouts in alb.  if we are not talking to him already, he would be another guy worth talking to."

"sandi, sorry for just now getting back with you."
i was out last week.
the rate ($.
04/mmbtu) will be charged on the greater of the volumes nominated on the supply contracts or the actual deliveries to the plant.
the fee will be adjusted yearly based on cpi.
bob - i could not remember if we stated the type of settlement on the delivered volumes (actuals or nominations).
i think we should use actuals due to possibility that the plant could over pull with out our knowledge on a daily basis.
"we would receive the estimates/actuals on a lag and may have to purchase gas to offset the imbalance, even though the plant kept the noms at the 45,000 base."
"i also think that if the plant does increase the nom, they are more likely to pull the additional volume rather than pulling less.  do you agree with this?"

"on january 13, 2000, ferc issued a section 7(c) certificate for transwestern's gallup expansion."
"the commission's order contained two conditions:  1) that transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of the order, and 2) that transwestern restructure its relationship with enron compression services so that transwestern will have sufficient operation control over the motor at the gallup compressor station to assume regulatory responsibility for the motor's operation, and that transwestern file a report with the commission stating how it complied with this condition."
"transwestern accepted the  certificate january 14, 2000 but reserved the right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order."
"on january 18, 2000, transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the condition that transwestern file its discounted rates."
"transwestern has already filed with the commission the discounted rates it will charge its expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality."
transwestern intends to file a request for rehearing of the january 13 order explaining why the commission erred in ordering transwestern to publicly disclose its discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure through a discount report.

"""mary, i finally was able to locate my copy of the alternative rates policy statement and found the following language: """"a pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated rate at the time it intends the rate to go into effect."
the commission does not intend to suspend the effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or impose a refund obligation for those rates.
"for these reasons, the commission will readily grant requests to waive the 30 day notice requirement."""
""" i think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's ok to file on the same day."

here is ena's peaker comp analysis.

"in most cases, ena will be a net buyer from tenaska iv for activity related to the cleburne plant."
"however, for october 2000, the plant was down the majority of the month and ena sold off the supply, resulting in ena owing money to tenaska iv."
"i have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the calculated amount of income on the cleburne desk."
(please see the attached schedule.)   we need to pass this income on to tenaska iv.  do we need to pay this amount (wire from ena to tenaska iv) or is there another way to do this?
this is the case for october 2000 and could possibly happen again in the future.
"greg, troy, jim - please let me know what you think about settling this."
"megan - don't pay the amount until we here from the greg, troy and jim."
"also, make sure that we have received dollars from the spot sales before we reimburse tenaska iv."

we heard from many of you regarding the financial hardship this shut down may cause schultz area producers while a gas delivery alternative was being constructed.
"given your concerns and given that natural gas liquids prices have risen sufficiently to allow operations at schultz to be marginally profitable, cng transmission will continue to operate the schultz facility until: 1."
"it becomes uneconomic to continue operations or, 2."
cng develops a compression/pipeline alternative for delivering and processing the schultz area gas elsewhere on its system.
we remain committed to serving producers throughout the appalachian basin and hope this operating decision addresses the concerns voiced by you.

"all have responsibility for mid and back office operations for the following enron entities:  enron north america, enron europe, enron south america, enron global markets, enron industrial markets, enron broadband services and enron energy services."

attached for your reference is the agenda.
"there may be some slight changes before the forum begins, but this will give you a good idea of the topics to be covered and the other speakers who will address the group."
"you are scheduled to address the group as follows: date:  monday, october 23, 2000 time:  8:00 am (breakfast will be served at 7:30 and you are invited to join us) place:  the warwick hotel the versailles room - 12th floor 5701 main street houston,  tx  77005 with a small group, your talk can be informal and you do not need to prepare slides (unless you would like to do so)."

"dale, richard, i am ready to cover the cost of steve's trip to houston (one month in the summer)."
i think very highly of steve and think about coaching him a bit to expand his horizons.
i see him as a very valuable asset of enron and a great leader in not too distant future.
he needs exposure to more diverse business problems and areas of research.
i think it will be in the best interest of the company to devote some resources to foster his development.

"hopefully none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made for desk, phone and computers for all."
"secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them to enron."
"finally, after i know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this summer."
i welcome ideas on this from any of you.
i think you should arrange for a formal presentation of this material to myself and other folks in rac.
i believe this is the direction of future risk control activity and all of us need to be updated.
scheduling something after the board meeting would be helpful.
