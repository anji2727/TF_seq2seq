"""we did not answer protests to our order 637 filing."
the gist of pnm's protest in rp00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.
i agree with pnm that our tariff language is vague in this regard.

can someone help me with this?
"since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, i would say we probably wouldn't mind if ferc rejected our tariff sheet outright."
"however, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language."
"or they could tell us to remove the """"subject to transportation and fuel"""" provision."
"if we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer."
"however, i am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so i can justify it to ferc."

"joe, any interest in speaking?"
i have been working with ramona and lorraine to make system adjustments to tw's lft arising from conclusions made at a northern lft meeting a few weeks ago.
"one change that has been called for is that if a limited day is called (for now let's say a total limited day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no lft can flow at any time during that day but the lft shipper would have the option to flow it to the extent space is available."
"if a limited day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, lft shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled it."
drew latched onto this when i mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.
"as currently configured, tw's system would allow lft shippers to put in nominations on a limited day, and if any lft capacity were in fact available that lft would be scheduled."
"similarly, if tw were to notify shippers of a partial limited day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, tw's system (today) would allow lft shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%."
"tw's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a limited day is defined as a day on which tw may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for limited days on which any quantity of gas is transported."
"our question was whether, by changing tw's lft system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the it rate is generally lower than our firm rate)."
"if so, is the change necessary for some other reason?"
please let me know what you think.

it's funny the spreads in gas.
"first, in gas, you can play the seasonality game."
does anybody want to buy m/n at 1 back.
"no, of course not."
"but in crude, m/n at ."
10 back is normal.
definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month.
i can't remember w/o looking at charts.
it's always the mentality of:
"quentin, i forwarded your resume to our sydney office with a request to invite you for an introductory interview."

enjoy the trip.
two of our most fun vacations were at south seas planatation on captiva island.
sorry that i didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.
it will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.
"yes, the bed and changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table."
"our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl."
"if i remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim."
it's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.
we also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.
"as the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers."
"i am mailing you a martha stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them."
"yes, good news on dad."
i hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.
it is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.
it is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.
i think that he dodged a bullet on this one.
we will look forward to seeing you and chris for thanksgiving.
no big plans yet.
i assume that everyone will be here by at least wednesday night.
i have ordered a birthday cake from rj goodies to help celebrate all november birthdays that evening.
am hoping that mom and dad may come over on tuesday so that we can do some fun things on wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for thanksgiving!).
i will have the whole week off from work.

i have made continental my airline of choice for as long as i can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.
"this morning, however, i had a very bad experience."
i booked tickets for a vacation back on september 4th for a trip from houston to new york on december 1.
"since i booked the ticket, i became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that i will still be unable to travel on december 1st due to complications with my pregnancy."
"my doctor indicated to me that i may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in june."
"i spoke to leroy peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on september 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time i book a ticket for me or my husband."
i understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if i had just decided that i didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend.
"in my opinion, this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications."
"as you can see with my situation, it is unlikely that my husband and i will be able to plan a vacation by september of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child."
i repeatedly asked leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone i could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy.
i indicated that i could provide a doctor's note if necessary.
"he was very rude to me, stating """"you don't have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing - i already told you no!""""  i had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on southwest airlines for the same reason, but i was hoping that i would be able to fly again by now."
"for your information, your competitor was very helpful."
"they accepted my doctor's note, gave me a credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if i am still unable to use it."
that ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare.
"although i have always used continental  for my personal travel, the treatment i have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices."
"if there is anything you can do to help, i would greatly appreciate it."""

08:18 pm<br>to: houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits you may have recently received communication from united healthcare (uhc) concerning memorial hermann health systems' (mhhs) decision to terminate their contract with uhc  in the houston/beaumont area.
this communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.
it is our intent to help you understand the situation.
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and enron!
"when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, memorial hermann cancelled their contract."
"while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc, enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts."
"at this time, it is only uhc which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well."
"many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those with admission privileges to the woodlands, sugarland and clear lake hospitals, to name a few."
"in a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo options, enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between september 28 and december 31, 2000 as if the termination of the memorial hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in-network benefits applied."
office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.
hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with uhc.
"these steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by primary care physician disruption from 1,050 to 127."
if you need medical attention:  you or your doctor/hospital must call uhc's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.
in some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.
"if this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement."
claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).
open enrollment materials will be coming soon.
take this opportunity to consider your elections for 2001.
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees through this transition.
we will communicate any  further developments that may impact you or your family.
i can cancel the other meeting vince

mike mcconnell asked me to contact you to set up a 30 minute appointment with him and jeff shankman for next week..
"please let me know if you will be available at 4:30 p.m. on tuesday, 10/17, or 3:30 p.m. or 4:"
"allyson, will the certification of necessity be specific to ena?"
i ask this because i suspect that at some point we will want a special purpose company to be involved.
this provides us with the option of selling the equity of the entity developing the project.
your advise is appreciated.

i would strongly support his movement into either serc or ecar as per our earlier discussion.
i hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets.
i would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various desks.
the goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support john's iniatives on the fundamental groups.

"""drew -- here is lorraine's update on the val verde situation that i mentioned in my previous e-mail."
recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years.
i've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we can do.
"the proposed amendment lorraine is referring to, which burlington rejected, modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 250,000 mmbtu."
// burlington resources - val verde plant - michelle and i had a follow-up conversation with br thursday.
i faxed the proposed amendment to br monday and we hadn't heard from them yet.
"they claim approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down."
michele and darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take br's gas.
"i mentioned to br that we were putting this info together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 190,000 mmbtu from about mid-june through july, our data would not accurately reflect br's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190."
"they will not accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically """"best efforts"""" and """"subject to operating conditions on tw"""", so we will need to revise this further."
we offered alternate receipt point flexibility at ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at el paso blanco on their jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.
"they have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their san juan - waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06)."

i just finished having lunch with tobin and he filled me in a bit about this morning's meeting.
"i don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc. but i wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation."
whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in the best and most open manner possible.
in no way can or should your conduct be called into question.
bearing that in mind any criticism that was expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.
i am sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those being criticized.
"furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will inevitably open."
"there isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when they come along (which is exactly what you've done)."
keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.

here is the abb contract you referenced in your email.
i am working on a 97-10 compliant epc contract for nepco/eecc.
"however, i wonder about the challenges presented with the need for nepco to enter into subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all the way down the line."
this is a very tall order given the contracting environment.
"your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion."

"sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but i just checked my email."

it sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.
i think it healthy to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.
"this better understanding, i find, typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more happiness in life."
"however, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair."
"we all have regrets, but these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the long run."

"hi guys, in looking at crra's comments to the draft loi."
i have these questions: 1.
i'm not sure what we mean by epc contract.
"is this referring to the fuel cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer?"
i know this may depend on whether crra or someone else is doing the balance of the construction activities.
2
"he expects one epc contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple contracts."
does anyone care?
3
does crra get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail the performance tests?
"we have discussed with fce the concept of a proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full reduction as to the failing unit(s) only."
"also, are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?"
is our fee at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform?
"thanks, kay"

"""this morning i raised a concern regarding tw's sale of excess fuel at downstream points."
here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points.
"with rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the cal."
border.
order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage.
it also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.
"that latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point """"x"""", it should resell the gas at point """"x"""" and not haul the gas to point """"y"""" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product."
my concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the san juan or permian and shipment of that gas to the cal.
border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the cal.
"border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the """"furthest upstream point"""" requirement or both."
"susan and my recollection was that when ecs wanted to receive the gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it."
i haven't confirmed that recollection but i am recalling that we told courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.
"irrespective of what we did with ecs, i think the following is the correct way to look at this situation:  we receive fuel at the shippers' receipt points."
"once we receive it, however, it is no longer """"fuel."""
"""  it becomes line pack until it is burned."
"line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  it also, obviously, has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel."
"it is our job to  manage line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, and sell it at locations where we are long."
if we end up long at the cal.
"border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels."
i wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the san juan and permian and selling line pack at the cal.
"border, but  thats not what we are talking about here."
i can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.
mkm--ok with you?

"hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe $145 - can you verify?"

"tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11."
0m) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups (mcconville and ondarza).
"as you are aware, i sued them for breach."
the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft. james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts.
it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop.
the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated.
it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.
8m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability.
lets discuss.

the meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.
experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.
this meeting will focus on the cgas storage contract.
what we bill ces for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.
april is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.
cgas only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.
the deals in sitara are set up as cpr storage for the injections and the withdrawals.
which brings up the following issues; *   how do we bill ces for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with ces at the storage facility.
kate fraser said there were never any bug buy/sale tickets in sitara for storage.
how did that work?
"mark, i'm counting on you for this one."
* how do we track the storage balance in unify?
"* how are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since cgas will bill on the net injections/withdrawals i'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting."

i took a message from pat brown at avista this morning.
she needed to book one more spa reservation for jean gonnella.
the only time jean can do it is between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the thursday they arrive.
she would like a deep cleansing facial and a french manicure.
"if there isn't time for both, she'd just like the facial."
please call pat and confirm the reservation time when you make it.
her number is 509.495.8123.
thanks!
p.s. i don't want you to think i'm passing the buck.
"i would have taken care of this myself, but mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on tuesday morning."
"good luck, and let me know if you need help."

according to mike this is a q1-01 deal i will double check with the broker and get back to you
how about 4:00?
"jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and i need to know if you want breslau."

have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts?
come out with a whole bunch of cool new machines and your stock gets whacked.
what a weird deal that is.
"anyway, when do you think the new imacs will be out in stores?"
i still havent' got around to buying sandra her imac and now she thinks she wants the imac notebook so its a good thing i didn't do this last month.  do you concur that the new ones are worth the wait or should we pick up an old one on mega sale once stores start clearing the old ones out?
df
a likely story.
"by the way, what do you think of having rob or someone obs the coyote springs contract so we can use it as a starting point?"
"karen, jeff is traveling today."
is this the type of release that i should try to get to him before it goes out?
i agree that discussing the numbers in person with aa would be the right way to handle this.
"and, i am looking to brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting."
my expectation is that the vast majority of the $49mm variance will be explained and finalized by monday at 11:00 am.
this finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.
"i will be on vacation on monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but i have carved out time during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation, as it is very important to me. --sally"
please do.

i spoke with rich yesterday.
he said it would be ok to net the storage true up invoice from ernie with the sep invoice.
i mailed the invoice via interoffice to jeff.
there are 6 or 7 deals that ena billed ces for september that should probably be billed to new power.
all of the deals in question are on the central desk.
how does the reconciliation look for jan - june?
rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.
"hey becky, i haven't heard from you in a while."
"i know, i know, you haven't heard from me either."
i wanted to check in and see how you're doing.
i talked to shannon and she filled me in on how megan's doing.
i want you to know my family and i are praying for you guys.
i know everyone says this but if there is anything i can do i'd love to help out.
i'm going christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.
i've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.
he had a hip replacement in october and is still hobbling around.
he's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.
i think he expected to be running marathons by now.
"i'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...work."
i think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.
we have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.
"well, i have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month."
so that's pretty much all i have time to do now.
in fact i'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.
that is the one bonus of this split shift day.
let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.

"you may notice that 9911 pma's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final p&l.  you will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is unaccounted for gas."
"at the close of business for the 991 p&l, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in ua4."
we thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the pma's we would take as a result of this ua4 blowout.
"therefore, the net impact of 9911 pma's is $41,119 or 2% of last day p&l. i just wanted to congratulate the team on a great p&l for the month of november. -eric"

a w4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay period.
there are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing status.
"the higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld."
married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.
"there is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion."
"if you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on april 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately."
"if you don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (april 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and married and jointly."
i hope that made sense.

i think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to have keith and ray briefed and ready to answer all ferc's questions without deferring any to other people.
"ray and keith, please talk to gary zahn and make sure you are up to speed on everything ferc has asked for and focused on so far."
"you don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more responsive to what they want to ask you about."
"if you do get stumped, try to defer the question by telling ferc you need to check on a fact or two and can answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview."
"by doing that , you should be able to get them the information they need without having them cross examine a bunch of other people."
"inevitably, if you ask enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers."
"lee, i'd like you to be on the phone call with ray, keith and gary to discuss generally what to be ready for and what ferc has already looked at."

"during june, coral transacted on eol."
"however, they selected a july thru october deal by mistake."
"the marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a second deal in eol."
"coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it was unwound."
"but, since eol deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to zero volume and price."
logistics will be brokering the transactions in mops.
please be sure that coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals.

"""i reviewed the latest draft of aa's management rep. letter and caught a few innaccuracies in the way aa described the deal."
"i attach a revised draft of the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes i think we need to make to keep it accurate."
"first, aa only listed two of the four agreements that comprise the deal."
they apparently forgot that we had created a second sba.
"additionally, at transcanada's request, we put the transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year."
"you will recall that last year, sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the sba."
"second, aa's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that northern does not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term of the agreement."
that statement is confusing given that article vi.
b of the monthly pack agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is a form of purchase option.
"that cash out mechanism was in kent's bullets describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that aa looked at, so i assume they are ok with the mechanism and were just inartful in drafting bullet no. 4."
"my simple fix was to leave aa's language alone but to add an """"except for"""" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4."
"third, aa's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous references to """"other agreements"""" and """"additional agreements"""" respectively."
"since aa's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete, these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate."
"now that i have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, i've clarified the bullets by adding the """"other than those agreements referenced above"""" language to both bullets."
the couple of other changes in bullet 5 simply clarify the meaning.
"finally, i've modified the signature blocks per conversation with bill to delete mkm and myself."
"i am certainly willing and able to sign this letter, but mkm is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements."
getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.
"additionally, bill's thought was that mkm and i are his direct reports anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the top guy has signed."
"please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these matters."""

i wanted to make the following points: 1.
brad will not show up on march 15.
he is still working on his dot-com business and wants to pursue this opportunity.
2
my recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand.
either brad or a stipend refund check should show up on march 15. 3.
i told brad that  a failure to show up on march 15 will not imperil his future employment opportunities with enron.
we just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs.

"on 10/27/00, ferc issued two orders that clarify procedures for requesting long term transmission."
(morgan stanley v. ill. powerand tenaska power v. spp).
"in both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) transmission service and in both cases, the atc was insufficient to award the entire request."
"transmission providers, ill. power and spp treated partial service differently."
in these orders ferc holds: a transmission provider (tp) is not required to offer short term service in response to a long term request.
section 19.7 of the pro forma oatt only obligates the tp to tell the customer how much partial long term service could be provided.
examples: -- customer requests 300 mw long term transmission service for one year.  tp replies that it can offer 200 mw for the entire year. -- customer requests 2 year service for 300 mw.  tp replies that it can offer 300 mw for one year. -- customer requests 300 mw for one year.  tp can only provide 300 mw for summer months.  tp is not obligated to provide customer the 3 months service.
"furthermore, an annual request for 300 for some months and 0 mw for others is not a valid long term request."
what customer is then doing is really submitting a short term request for 300 for summer only -- a new short term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.
"while the tp is not required to respond with short term availability in response to a long term request, ferc did footnote to ill. power that it thinks it is a helpful idea for the tp to alert the customer to what atc is available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes."
"im big on togetherness, but if you'd rather do separate meetings i'm ok with that also."

"the data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation."
so far things are looking good.
we are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting texas on monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.
i wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the pop is so high right now is tropical moisture in the gulf of mexico and that will blow through this weekend.
after that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.
there may be a possible bust in 17.4..

her number is 425-462-3844.
"if you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask. ]"
thanks for the suggestions for richard.
let me know if you think of other ideas - i need b'day and christmas ideas.
probably the easiest thing to bring for thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or something else that is a favorite of your family.
i know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be working on wednesday morning.
"i have made thanksgiving dinner for so many years (one of the few times that i really like to cook), that i will be glad to cover it."
your company will be the very best thing that you can bring.
we are looking forward to having you all here.
(the sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this friday!
i second that--thanks a lot!!
i just don't want you getting me worked up when there is nothing i can do about it now.

oh and the deal number for the second mike s aquilla deal is 418401

"""this transation is for delivery on anr pipeline company's mainline 7 segment, and as such,  all deliveries shall be made utilizing firm transportation to a designated secondary delivery point (buyer's choice"""") on anr's system."

"maria friend when you receive this, say a prayer."
that's all you have to do.
there is nothing attached.
this is powerful.
"just send this to four people and do not break this, please."
prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive.
there is no cost but a lot of rewards.
let's continue praying for one another.
"father, i ask you to bless my friends reading this right now lord, show them a new revelation of your love and power."
"holy spirit, i ask you to minister to their spirit at this very moment."
"where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy."
"where there is self-doubting, release a renewed confidence in your ability to work through them."
"where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, i ask you to give them understanding, patience, and strength as they learn submission to your leading."
"where there is spiritual stagnation, i ask you to renew them by revealing your nearness, and by drawing them into greater intimacy with you."
"where there is fear, reveal your love, and release to them your courage."
"where there is a sin blocking them, reveal it, and break its hold over my friend's life."
"bless their finances, give them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends to support, and encourage them."
"give each of them discernment to recognize the demonic forces around them, and reveal to them the power they have in you to defeat it."
i ask you to do these things in jesus' name.
"in christian love, your friend in jesus."
passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
passing this on to one not considered a friend is something i know christ would do.

i have asked ena's compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president.
"this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena, eim and egm."

the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd.
i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project!
todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations.
"since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below, i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todd's review."

"""transwestern held its transport options workshop on august 31."
"commercial and regulatory representatives of bp-amoco, burlington, conoco, coral, dynegy, phillips and reliant attended."
"after a brief overview of the proposed filing, tw opened the floor for questions and comments."
here is a summary of the comments.
marketing affiliate concerns.
bp's regulatory representative expressed concern that tw's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.
"in bp's example, since tw and ena are both enron companies, ena could purchase an """"out of the money"""" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (tw) would have the ability to buy the option back."
"proceeds from ena's ability to then """"move the market"""" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to enron's bottom line."
"bp suggested that tw's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers."
"although bp admits that transwestern's prior dealings with ena have not been suspect, bp fears that tw's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service."
"since tw will be the first pipeline to offer such services, bp wants tw's program to be as restricted as possible."
"dynegy echoed bp's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage."
"tw's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, tw should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program."
"if bp and others have serious concerns regarding the commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines."
right of first refusal.
burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.
tw's  response was that rofr will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.
negotiated rate.
bp's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.
tw did not respond to this or discuss it further.
"however, tw's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate."
hoarding capacity.
"using the recent large block sale of capacity on el paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity."
it was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.
"perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier."
tw acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for ferc's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.
"although tw did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that ferc may require tw to do so in a final order."
"our plan is to meet with pg&e and socalgas in california the week of september 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the ferc filing by mid-september."""

"""keith, the article i mentioned."
vince *********************************************** rashed by tax selling but are there bargains among the discards?
by michael santoli here it is more than six months since even the most intransigent last-minute filers wrote checks to the irs to render to the government its due for their financial good fortune in 1999.
"by rights, this should be a season relatively free of concerns about taxes, notwithstanding the presidential candidates' parrying over whose tax-cut math features more fuzz."
"and yet, for anyone with a dollar in the stock market (which in recent weeks has likely been reduced to loose change), the looming demands of this year's levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet another taxing october for investors."
the jump-and-stumble course the major stock indexes have taken this year is being blamed for a particularly intense effort among mutual-fund managers and other big investors to sell their losers.
the steep ramp-up in stocks that persisted from the fall of 1999 through the first quarter of this year -- led by the technology must-haves -- left funds with ripe profit-taking opportunities when the nasdaq surge flagged in april.
this sell-high activity generated heavy capital gains in many portfolios -- tax liabilities that managers have been rushing to offset with realized losses by selling stocks that have cratered.
the fact that so many funds are enduring a flat-to-down year in this difficult market has only added to the urgency.
investors aren't fond of getting stuck with taxable distributions in even the most flush years of a bull market.
"so managers are now trading in fear of how their shareholders will react to funds' kicking off gains distributions in a year when the value of their holdings fails to appreciate or, worse, falls outright."
"with the majority of funds operating on an october 31 fiscal year end, and given a trend toward letting investors know their estimated tax hit well before year's end, much of this selling has been concentrated in a brief period of weeks."
"one fund executive attending a fidelity mutual-fund conference last week reported that, oddly, some managers have resolved to be contrary and """"overdo it"""" in selling even their winners."
"the theory, he reports, is that if they're going to have a capital-gains distribution anyway, the most skittish shareholders will sell the fund to avoid the payout and its tax liability, whether it's, say, either 10% or 12% of net asset value."
"so the idea is to take profits and """"reload"""" for the benefit of those investors who will stick around."
"now, with the nasdaq off 22.7% since labor day and 8% so far in october, much talk is bubbling about suggesting that the assault is ending."
this line of reasoning counsels that it's time to peek out of the foxhole and survey the wreckage for some badly damaged stocks to pick up in expectation of a late-year rally.
not so fast.
"while it's true that in past years, these hard-hit tax-selling victims tend to recover in the early part of november, the move often proves fleeting."
"like a ball being held under water, these stocks jump when the downward pressure is released, but that doesn't mean they escape gravity's pull for long."
"soon enough, they're hit by a secondary wave of selling by investors who tidy up their tax situation closer to the end of the year."
the quantitative equity research team at lehman brothers has studied recent market history in search of patterns in tax-driven selling.
"in the process, the analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look vulnerable to persistent weakness through most of the fourth quarter."
"the study scanned the russell 3000 index -- basically the 3,000 largest u.s. stocks -- for those that had fallen at least 40% this year through september, and had lost at least 10% in the prior six months."
they also plucked only those stocks that had seen rising trading volume over that period.
the idea was to find only those names that seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo.
"in 1997, there were just eight such stocks."
"in 1998, there were 202 and last year 101, on a par with this year's tired crop."
"murali ramaswami of lehman says, """"there's both a tax-loss story and a momentum story."
"losers continue to be losers."""
""" at least through the fourth quarter they do."
the negative momentum of these stocks tends to gather speed from the first week of november to christmas.
"in this period, from 1997 through last year, the losers portfolio dropped an average of 20% more than did the russell 3000 index."
"bottom-fishers, beware."
"the resulting list, which lehman billed to its institutional clients as a menu for hungry short-sellers, features numerous stocks caught in the major downside themes of the year."
"name a major telecom-services provider and the odds are good it's in this bunch, the result of a stampede away from the group. big retailers also dot the down-on-their-luck roster, as the slowing economy has ravaged shares of circuit city, dillards, saks and others."
"and of course there are plenty of dot.com names experiencing the ugly side of a mania undone, in a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the market's windshield."
witness barnesandnoble.com and razorfish.
"an intrepid prospector surveying this list in a quest for next year's comeback stock of the year will encounter no shortage of companies that appear, for the moment, broken and in need of an inspired strategic revamping, some slick investor-relations work and plenty of luck."
"former blue chips such as lucent technologies, bausch & lomb and dial seem to fall into that club, where for investors a love of dirt-cheap stocks and a strong backbone is the price of admission."
"dupont, which recently ratcheted down its 2001 growth forecast and is beset by high raw-materials costs, is arguably apt to remain in the investors' time-out chair for a while as well."
that its shares failed to sell off after a limp earnings report last week is perhaps the most hopeful sign one can seize on with regard to the chemicals giant.
"still, for the investor patient enough to endure what could be a stormy november and december, a few sizable companies with temporary problems but solid long-term growth stories are attracting some fund managers looking to buy."
"as detailed in barron's last week (""""retailers on sale,"""" october 23), there is reason to expect better performance from selected retail chains."
"federated department stores, the parent of macy's and bloomingdale's, merits attention both for its buoyant same-store sales growth in a retail headwind and for its repair of the addled fingerhut catalogue division, which suffered a spike in delinquencies."
"the shares are off their trough levels in the low 20s, but a recent quote of 28 still seems a better-than-fair price for a company that some pros believe could earn more than $5 a share next year."
the advertising business this year is being given the cold shoulder by investors after a torrid love affair through 1999.
"fearing that the dot.com washout and resultant cash drought would wither the bottom line of ad firms, investors abandoned interpublic, the third-largest owner of ad agencies after wpp and omnicom."
"but mark greenberg, manager of the invesco leisure fund, saw a chance to pick up a """"good, solid company"""" inexpensively when interpublic hit the low 30s."
"now at 39, interpublic is still fetching just 22 times forecast 2001 earnings, which are expected to grow 15%, faster than profits for the overall market. """
"""i bought some early this year and added to it just recently."
"the bad news is probably priced into the stock, and then some,"""" he says."
"madison avenue markdown interpublic, parent of mccann erickson, among other firms, has always suffered a bit in comparison with omnicom, a market darling considered the class operator in the industry."
"but interpublic now trades at a discounted valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing and public-relations business, which are growing faster than the traditional madison avenue game."
add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes from dot.
"coms and that half its revenues are collected overseas, and interpublic appears well insulated from crippling economic forces."
"in a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits valassis communications, a big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts that fall out of your sunday paper."
"a well-loved growth stock that pleased many a small and mid-cap fund manager in 1999, valassis this year ran into a nettlesome combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price competition in one of its insert categories."
"investors bailed out in droves, halving the stock from a high above 44 to just north of 20."
"now at 25, the shares are """"absurdly cheap,"""" says greenberg, who also owns valassis."
"another fund manager points out that the company has taken control of its troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply in products where pricing declined."
"even with its growth forecast revised downward, valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% long-term rate, and earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a share."
that leaves the stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits.
"and it's worth noting that in times of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things that companies continue to offer to bargain-hunters."
"with a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard stocks any week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter rebound in the year's losers that's been documented by lehman brothers is hopelessly distant."
"if you're tempted nonetheless to plunge ahead and buy a beaten-down mutual fund, check first to see if it will be among those making a capital-gains distribution later this year."
"in that case, you'll be on the hook for the tax even though you didn't participate in the gain."
"(you can take the plunge without worrying about payouts if you're buying the fund for a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or an ira.) but at least in selected stocks, it seems the machinations of tax-fearing investors have created the stock market equivalent of a 25%-off sale, and you don't need to redeem a manufacturer's coupon to take advantage."""
"guys, wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in mariner in order to meet global finance and ena targets."
i want a view from you guys of what is the prudent carry value for mariner assuming current gas prices and the reserve increases assumed to coming.
keep in mind what would be a reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan.

"great--steve, what's your phone no. ?"
we will change it so that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from enron.
"rose, i suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can assign without consent."
"as of now commercial operation is not a defined term (i hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a different milestone."
"thanks, kay"
carol: thank you for the prompt.
the only times stan has available for this conference call would be at 8:00am tomorrow morning or 8:

based on our discussion and after further consideration i feel that it would be an excellent fit for both the real time group and myself.
"with my prior and current work experience and knowledge of the enpower system,    i am confident that i will be a valuable asset to your team."
i look forward to the opportunity and eagerly await your positive response.
please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns you may have.

go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities.
it may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process.
how should we participate in this market?
gasification technology?
"jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie) the technologies, the users, the vc's, etc.  specifically, how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model?"
how are we positioning ourselves in this market?
what is the pi strategy with this regard?
"dorie hitchcock and tammy sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, we need a first cut by december 8th."

i think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.
i talked to patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users perspective.
"my thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over different scenarios within each region, such as opal plant, socal, etc.  we can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with."
"i also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and i did not want to forget them."
1
"when we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred."
2
should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes at a late time?
we could do the rest over the phone.
3
"on edi pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30."
i thought these were just questions we might want to think about.
i'm sure there are a lot of others.
thanks.

"http://www.cme.com/fe50 ______________________________________________________________________ herb on thestreet: taking a closer look at the honey well by herb greenberg senior columnist 9/11/00 6:30 am et an item in one of last week's hotlines questioned whether a key """"tell"""" toward a possible preannouncement from honeywell (hon:nyse) was an earnings warning from invensys, a british controls and automation company."
"invensys is a honeywell competitor, and honeywell fans had been looking at the company's controls group for signs of strength this quarter."
"got a bunch of angry email, in response, telling me i must be a kook (or actually, something much worse ) because just a few weeks ago honeywell said it was comfortable with earnings estimates of 76 cents per share, which would be a pleasant 10% gain."
"true, but this is, after all, the same honeywell that in june gave expectations of one thing for second-quarter revenues, only to amend that a few weeks later with a lower number."
"and this is, after all, the same honeywell that several quarters ago said it would take no more big charges, and then turned around and took a whole bunch of new charges."
will the same thing happen this time round?
"hard to say, and as of friday all a honeywell spokesman would say to me was: """"we're sticking with our guidance."""
""" on earnings, that is."
"interestingly (and subtly) honeywell didn't say anything about revenues in its recent update, and the spokesman said there will be no revenue guidance now, either."
"stung once, too smart to be stung twice, i guess."
"but that also highlights that honeywell has entered the quarter with negative revenue momentum, which is not what wall street wants to see."
earnings can meet estimates lots of different ways (an item here back in march showed how half of honeywell's 20% earnings gain came from pension income) but revenue represents business in the raw.
"so, why worry now?"
"according to one longtime honeywell watcher, who prefers to go incognito (so he can protect his relationship with the company, in which he still holds a small stake), events that could further effect this quarter's earnings and revenues include the sharp rise in oil prices -- the same rise in oil prices that last week helped clobber dupont (dd:nyse), which warned of lower earnings (thanks, in part, to oil)."
honeywell also disclosed that problems with brakes it makes for buses will shave 2 cents per share off earnings.
"the warning came after the earnings reassurance a couple of weeks ago, but was included in the recent forecast."
"it's unclear, however, how the problems will affect brake sales (and therefore revenues), going forward."
"oh, and honeywell is laying off 5% of its workforce."
"(a supposed growth company firing people?!) then there are more charges, lots of charges -- but the 76 cent per share number excludes them."
"what's more, analysts are just starting to take a close look at the company now that they're back from summer vacation."
"at least one analyst who has tried to get some sign of how things are going was told the company hasn't seen the august numbers yet, which means there still could be reasons for concern."
"all of that said, honeywell has been doing loads to improve itself, but our longtime honeywell watcher, who is looking for the right time to hop back in, doesn't think there'll be signs of a solid rebound until next summer."
at the earliest.
"short positions o from reader john lee: """"how's this for an inflation indicator?"
"down here in our cafeteria today we were confronted by a sign that indicated the cafeteria was raising prices """"to cover rising food and labor costs..."""" but inflation is nearly nonexistent, right?"
"right (he said, sarcastically)."
"wouldn't be surprised to see a few fast-food chains that missed earnings last quarter, because of rising costs, bite the bullet and raise prices, too."
(a dime or a quarter isn't going to drive customers away; but a dime here at one place and a quarter there at another would certainly lead to higher prices across the board.
or so you'd think!) o stupid poll?!
": that's what some folks thought of friday's poll which asked whether you should pay more attention to a company, friendly analysts or unfriendly analysts."
"(unfriendly won by a landslide.) several readers, however, wish i'd had a fourth alternative: all of the above."
"says reader bridget magnus: """"i think that if a person is going to make a realistic, informed decision about a company it is a good idea to listen to all three of those sources (the company, friendly analysts, and unfriendly analysts)."
"putting them together will give a potential investor a much clearer picture of what is (or isn't) going on."""
""" great point!"

"george wrote the textbook on how to be a hard-working, daily, news-oriented columnist."
"you could see just how hard he worked when he walked through the office at the end of every day, looking exhausted, as he handed the finished copy into his editor."

i would expect that sarah tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make good on our promise.
deal # q52317 - the counterparty is nylon de mexico and the contact is alberto diosdado.
the originator on the deal is agustin perez.
howard can you remove me from this distribution list - my life is a little complicated.
"my phone's not working(no signal in the woods), but i'll call you when i go to ruston tomorrow afternoon."
fyi.
can you make a call tomorrow at 100?
have you decided?
i am not trying to rush you - but i am leaving early today for austin - so i need to set my lineup before i leave!
"we will be meeting with gil muhl, janet dietrich and others to discuss customer coverage, deal flow, strategic deals/customers etc.  i think the meeting is going to held offsite  at either the doubletree or hyatt."
i know that you are disappointed about his move.
"rick:  sorry, i should have sent this to you several days ago."
is the level of detail correct on these goals as you look to assimilate these with others?
"i have stated the goals, but not the action plan to achieve the goals."
i am working on those in some detail right now.   --sally goals for 2000 global risk management operations i.  build/enhance operational and controls infrastructure to support: a.  merchant activities japan southern cone continental europe other regions as identified b.  emerging businesses/products enron broadband services credit trading other products as identified c.  joint ventures ii.
"strengthen mid and back office talent and controls for global risk management operations a.  establish common operational standards,with effective exception reporting b.   strengthen and support the controls mindset in key operational personnel c.  develop a plan to identify, develop and provide rotational opportunities to key operations employees d.  continue to coordinate with it to develop mid and back office systems that allow for timely and accurate compilation of data across  systems for risk and business reporting"
supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so i should be back in the world of reachable individuals next week.
i'm glad you appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.
"i was afraid after two weeks of silence i may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that last email would have probably been the final nail in the coffin."
as far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.
"turns out my trader went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me."
even without the connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my learning all i can about his book.
"hopefully, after i get the daily routine down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work."
"you should definitely try and see the film saturday and even if you can't pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, i really think you would enjoy/be inspired by it (at least i am every time i watch it)."
i hope things are well with you although i am sensing some disenchantment.
if that is the case i can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate your current position in life.
believe me over the last two months i have had ample opportunity to do just that.
just let me know if i can return the favour you once did for me.
have fun at y'alls happy hour tonight.

i heard through the grapevine you went the other weekend.

"danny clark, who used to work in deal clearing & documentation for ect a couple of years ago, is in ees as far as i know."

"on the effective termination date of the oba, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to burlington."
"the 12/31/92 interconnect point operating agreement, paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term."
this is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.
"however, the paragraph also provides that the agreement """"may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the oba between the parties is terminated."""
""" as we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh our other options first."

i realize the mass email has been mia the last two weeks.
for some this may have been a welcomed relief.
for others there may have been some concern that they had been cut-off from the distribution.
"at present no one has been removed from the distribution, but it is undergoing an audit."
should it be determined that it is necessary to remove an individual from the list for any reason that individual will be notified and given an explanation.
if anyone would like to know the causes for expulsion you can write to:  i can't believe anyone cares if there on this distribution or not because the only place we seem to go is woody's every thursday between 9:30 and 10:00.
"on that note, see you guys at woody's tonight around 9:30 or 10:00."
i'm going to visit with the hermanator briefly tomorrow.
fyi - please fix my name on you emails.
they say phillippe love.
thanks.

i forwarded your request to luchas johnson.
he runs the g-daily-est book.
dg    3-9573<br>enron north america corp.
in his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including socal oir related services -- $3000/mo.).
this e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only.
"the recently expired market development agreement with igs provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between transwestern and third party """"identified by igs under this agreement."""
"""  as you know, the """"identified by"""" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the southern energy gallup expansion contract, in which both igs and the tw commercial group worked on the deal."
"fortunately, the ambiguity worked to transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with igs both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement."
mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis.
"this immediately eliminates the """"identified by"""" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on."
i propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement.
"if mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed)."
"for each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement."
i've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion.
the numbers are mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.
"i've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to transwestern."
call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed.
"from time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, igs may present brief, preliminary project proposals to transwestern."
"if transwestern desires igs's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify igs in writing and shall execute an agreement with igs adopting the following terms and conditions: 1."
retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.
"project development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of transwestern as requested by transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal."
transwestern and igs may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements.
transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or transwestern notifies igs in writing that it has decided to terminate the project.
2
"if transwestern accepts the project described in igs's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay igs a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project]."
"""""accepting the project"""" means that the project meets transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the transwestern commercial group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion."
accepting the project and paying igs pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates transwestern to pursue the project to completion.
3
"if transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay igs $10,000."
"additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project)."
"(i will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.)."

i have a favor to ask.
jason sokolov who works with us part-time (he is a rice mba candidate) has been accepted as a summer intern.
i suggested that he ask for a position with your group for this summer.
"he works currently with mike roberts, 4 hours a day."
jason is a very bright and hard working person and i can recommend him without reservations.

"mike moran has informed me that the ftc and u.s. doj, as part of their review of the el paso-coastal merger, have decided to take a close look at the merger's possible impact on competition in the chicago-wisconsin market."
"in this regard, those agencies need to set up a conference call in the next two weeks to discuss that issue with experts on that market from border and northern."
this will not be an on-the-record deposition.
it will be a conf. call and what i expect to be an  informal question and answer session on what we know.
representatives of the wisconsin and illinois attorney general's office (or whatever agency it is in those states that deals with antitrust issues) will be on the phone as they are working with the feds on the merger.
