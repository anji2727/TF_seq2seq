"in addition, a sale to the liquids group, which should have been zero, was brokered with a purchase from swift (2500 mmbtu/day), resluting in additional gas being allocated to the hplr liquids purchase contract."
i have attached a schedule detailing the volumes that were double booked in february.
this schedule also reports the daily volumes for march which will need to be adjusted.
"i have calculated (based on estimates) that we should have only purchased about 88,000 from the liquids group at king ranch for february."
"see the following: booked to hplr liquids: 539,574  18,606/day purch by hplc @ wh:  379,108  13,073/day incorrect liquids sale:    72,500  2,500/day adjusted purch from liquids:   87,986  3,034/day we usually input a purchase of 2,500 mmbtu/day from hplr liquids at the tailgate."
"we can increase this to 3,000/day for march."
the majority of gas in the 3-rivers system is transported to the king ranch plant through hgpl.
"some of this gas is purchased at the wellhead by hplc, some of the gas is purchased at the wellhead by hplr liquids, and three producers have the option to either sell their gas to hplc at the wellhead or to process their gas and sell the residue to hplc at the tailgate of the plant."
it is very important to keep the meters and volumes allocated correctly among parties related to these transactions.
the attached schedule should assist in doing this.
i have reported the meters at which hplc buys wellhead gas.
the movement of this gas through hgpl and king ranch should be kept seperate from the gas purchased by the liquids group.
a transport usage ticket can be used to show the transfer of hplc's gas from king ranch to hpl.
let's plan on discussing this either friday or monday afternoon.
let me know what works best for you.

thanks--excellent news.

drew -- i've looked at this and it is fine; really does not deviate from what we have posted before.
"one issue that arose friday was whether our all-or-nothing approach (i.e., shipper must take all 49,000 dth of capacity or none at all -- or all 20,000 or none at all) constitutes tying."
"the 49,000 package includes 35,000 to north needles and 14,000 to topock."
so if a shipper wants the needles space it has to take the topock space too.
"this looked like a clear case of tying to me until i remembered that this capacity is now, and has been, posted and available and any shipper can bid on any part of the needles space right now if they wanted to and we'd sell it to them without making them take the topock space."
"that'll be true during the ios too -- i.e., nothing can stop shippers from bidding on the needles space outside of the ios process."
this is just a situation in which we're putting a special package together with the expectation that the price will reflect the fact that the less desirable topock space is part of that package.
does this make sense to you?
"if not, give me a call."
"you may just need warm bodies at this point, big boy"
any info?

mike and heather perge!
"sorry , i have not given you feedback earlier but i've been on vacation."
randy continues to do an excellent job.
he anticipates questions and usually has the answers.
he is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on his knowledge base.
he has helped the traders trade the permian and waha points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.
the only area for improvement that i might suggest would be to challenge others or state his opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say anything or go along with the status quo.
he tends to want to be nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.
i'll tell you about it later.

i have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on the mg aquisition and assimilation.
would you please include me on that distribution list effective this week?
i believe that it is assumed that fernley dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the aquisition is completed.
"however, in my role over global risk management operations, i find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of operations and any issues surrounding assimilation."
"brent price, who reports to me and is on temporary assignment in the london office, has been keeping me updated on progress to date."
"his return soon to houston, however, will create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to fill."
thanks in advance to your attention to this.
miguel vasquez now is running the model and he has the updated proforma.

"my research group is establishing a long term collaboration with dr. kaminski and dr. gibner, and i hope to help foster this relationship this summer."
i would just like to discuss one issue that is very specific to my status of international student.
"as an international student, i am required to enroll part time at stanford university during the summer quarter in order to be considered eligible for a summer internship (""""optional practical training"""")."
the cost of the part-time tuition will be approx. $2300 for this academic year.
"the past summer, my employer (at&t) matched this tuition cost in an effort not to discriminate between international and domestic ph."
d. students.
the offers for summer employment i received this year have also been very flexible in this respect.
i would like to know if enron could do the same; it would be of course very much appreciated (given the notoriously precarious financial condition of ph.
d. students).
"yet, to make things clear, please rest assured that my acceptance of your offer is not conditioned on your reply regarding this issue, and that i intend to be at enron this summer."

i'm still hoping that will not be the case but am fully prepared for the possibility that my brief encounter with dating may be over for a while.

sally is trying to juggle her calendar in order that she will be able to attend presentation on sept. 28.
"her plan at this point, is to attend dinner & presentation on 28th but not dinner on the 27th."
"unfortunately, her schedule will not allow her to be out on thursday."

08:18 pm<br>to: houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits you may have recently received communication from united healthcare (uhc) concerning memorial hermann health systems' (mhhs) decision to terminate their contract with uhc  in the houston/beaumont area.
this communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.
it is our intent to help you understand the situation.
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and enron!
"when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, memorial hermann cancelled their contract."
"while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc, enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts."
"at this time, it is only uhc which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well."
"many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those with admission privileges to the woodlands, sugarland and clear lake hospitals, to name a few."
"in a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo options, enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between september 28 and december 31, 2000 as if the termination of the memorial hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in-network benefits applied."
office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.
hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with uhc.
"these steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by primary care physician disruption from 1,050 to 127."
if you need medical attention:  you or your doctor/hospital must call uhc's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.
in some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.
"if this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement."
claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).
open enrollment materials will be coming soon.
take this opportunity to consider your elections for 2001.
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees through this transition.
we will communicate any  further developments that may impact you or your family.

i don't think we will be able to do any payback at niagara or tenn/e aurora on the national fuel deal.
"after adjusting for what we took out today, we owe nat fuel about 88,500 dth."
here are the points that i believe will work best tenn/colden (meter #060003)  tenn zone 5 close to the niagara spur - we can use dracut supply or iroq/wright supply.
tenn/lamont (meter #020072)  tenn zone 4 - we can use cook school for this or dan can flow long haul - cook school is baseloaded into cng.
"trco/leidy - we currently have 1,000 dth from cgas going into cng - we can redirect this to nat fuel at no additional cost."

*** transwestern held its transport options workshop on august 31.
"commercial and regulatory representatives of bp-amoco, burlington, conoco, coral, dynegy, phillips and reliant attended."
"after a brief overview of the proposed tw options filing, we opened the floor for questions and comments."
here is a summary of the comments.
marketing affiliate concerns.
bp's regulatory representative expressed concern that tw's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.
"for example, since tw and ena are both enron companies, if ena buys a call option it is essentially a free option."
"ena could buy a call out of the money and we could buy it back from them, with the proceeds going to enron's bottom line."
"bp suggested that tw's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit the call money to other shippers."
"bp's concern is that tw's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service, so they want tw's options program to be as restricted as possible."
"dynegy reiterated its suggestion that the marketing affiliate be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by the affiliate and the next highest bidder's bid, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest bid by a certain percentage."
"our response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate would be a concern, we feel that tw is entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with the rules on sale of capacity to marketing affiliates."
at this point we are not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program.
"if bp and others have issues regarding commission marketing affiliate policy in general, those issues should be addressed in a different proceeding that pertain to all interstate pipelines."
right of first refusal.
burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.
our response was that rofr will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.
negotiated rate.
bp's representative claimed that options will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.
we did not respond to this or discuss it further.
"however, tw's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, the deals will only be negotiated rate deals if the total rate exceeds the maximum rate."
hoarding capacity.
several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity.
it was not clear why they thought that options would create more opportunity for hoarding than already exists.
their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier.
we acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for ferc's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.
"although we did not commit to placing any limits on the quantity of capacity for which a shipper may purchase an option, it is possible that ferc may require us to do so."
"our plan is to meet with pg&e and socalgas in california to elicit their comments, and finalize the ferc filing by mid-september."

please let me know if you have any more questions.

"he also played small roles in each film, even playing himself in a few!"
"he still runs many parts of four square productions, i'm told. ?"
"steve peace - writer/actor steve peace is probably best known in the kt films as wilbur, the dim-witted, parachute-wearing leader of the killer tomatoes task force."
he also wrote parts of the films as well.
"now, he's a state senator, and even has his own page at http://www.stevepeace.net ?"
"costa dillon - writer last, but definitley not least is costa dillon."
he's responsible for the entire concept of killer tomatoes!

"the slogan favoured by jim clark, creator of silicon graphics, net-scape and healtheon, has become the mantra of a generation of consultants and investment bankers."
"the new economy, they claim, requires new principles of valuation."
c.com is one of the most exciting prospects in business-to-business commerce.
"it is the world leader in a growing market - annual sales by 2010 are likely to be dollars 500,000bn."
if c.com can maintain a 5 per cent share and earn only 1 per cent net margin its prospective annual earnings will be dollars 250bn.
"if we assume that market growth after 2010 is 5 per cent and discount future revenues at 10 per cent, the prospective value of c.com is dollars 5,000bn - about 10 times the recent market capitalisation of microsoft, cisco or general electric."
you don't have to wait for the ipo.
you can buy shares in c.com right now for less than 5 per cent of that value.
"c.com is called citigroup and in addition to its foreign exchange trading, which is the business i have described, you get its other wholesale, retail and investment banking activities and a leading insurance company thrown in."
"of course, nobody would be so stupid as to value citigroup in this way."
yet i have followed more or less exactly the methodology recommended in the latest mckinsey quarterly for the valuation of new era companies.
"they use precisely analogous calculations to arrive at a valuation of dollars 37bn for amazon.com. paul gibbs, head of merger and acquisition research at j.p. morgan, recently used similar principles to confirm that assessment of amazon."
he then performed the same calculation for internet service provider freeserve.
"assume that uk retail sales grow at 5 per cent a year, that 25 per cent of sales take place on the net, that portals capture 50 per cent of these, that freeserve gets 30 per cent of the portal share and maintains an 8 per cent commission on sales."
multiply these together and you establish that in 2017 freeserve will make profits of o2bn (dollars 3.
2bn).
"this, he argues, justifies a value today of o6."
50 per share.
but i prefer t.com to freeserve.
t.com has a customer base four times larger than freeserve.
its franchise is stronger.
"its customers are concentrated in the affluent south-east of england, where it faces virtually no competition."
"market research shows that more than 95 per cent of its customers use its essential services every day, many of them several times a day."
t.com also has ambitious plans for expansion.
"at present, its geographical coverage is less than one-quarter of the market in england and wales."
t.com has an interest in south-east asia.
the population of china is 100 times the number of people who today can access t.com services.
"even after the recent market correction, t.com, better known as thames water, still has a market valuation below that of freeserve."
"at the widest point between the old and new economies, freeserve was worth four times as much."
"the reason the citibank calculation is nonsense is simple, but fundamental."
the margins citibank makes on its forex business vary widely.
"if you buy small quantities of notes from a bank, the spread is much wider than 1 per cent."
"if you are a large corporation trading major currencies, the margin is wafer thin."
entry and competition force prices down to the related costs.
"in mr gibbs's model, freeserve earns profits of o2bn, about equal to the current profits of tesco, j. sainsbury and marks and spencer together."
and it earns these on revenues of only o2.
"5bn, so that profits are 80 per cent of the value of its sales."
no established business earns margins of that size.
"thames water is one of a tiny number of companies whose market position is so strong, whose output is so necessary to life, that if it charged five times the current price we would have little choice but to pay."
we do have one option - to insist the government intervenes.
it confines thames water to a return on its capital employed of about 6 per cent.
"the idea that profit is a return on capital invested still has some role in new economy valuation, at the level of the overall market."
there is a key formula in the new math.
the required yield on a security is equal to the difference between the rate of return demanded from that class of securities and its expected rate of growth.
"so, if you expect a return of 5.5 per cent from a share whose dividends will grow at 5 per cent, calculations show that the dividend yield should be 0.5 per cent."
"this is the calculation done by james glassman and kevin hassett in their book dow 36,000*."
"claiming that sustainable dividends average half of earnings, this yield equates to a price/earnings ratio of 100 - implying a target of 36,000 for the us index."
the trouble with this theory is that it takes too long to produce what the investor is looking for.
investors will receive only two-fifths of the cash sustaining the valuation this century.
one-third of the total depends on dividend cheques that will arrive after 2200.
"two hundred years ago, well before the dow jones average, prudent, diversified investors would have owned slave traders and sugar plantations, or perhaps a bold speculation in that symbol of the then new economy -a canal."
the next 200 years may be more stable than the last and microsoft and cisco may prove more enduring than plantations.
but we can hardly be sure.
"while 5 per cent may be a reasonable assumption for the growth rate of dividends in the us economy as a whole, it is likely that well before 2200 most of these will come from companies not yet founded."
suppose we accept glassman and hassett's protests that their dividend growth expectations are conservative.
"if you raise them only from 5 per cent to 5.25 per cent, the anticipated value of the dow jones average is 72,000."
at 5.5 per cent the formula breaks down because the shares of us companies are infinitely valuable.
not even the most credulous dotcom investor believes that.
the math also works in reverse.
"if expectations of return are 6 per cent rather than 5.5 per cent, the market p/e ratio falls to 50 and the value of the dow jones from 36,000 to 18,000."
"and if equity investors require a return of 8 per cent, you would have to conclude that shares are worth only half their current level."
an 8 per cent expected total return is not ambitious for an equity investor.
a day trader might think you were talking about a weekly profit rather than annual.
glassman and hassett use a figure as low as 5.5 per cent - the return on treasury bonds - because they argue that equities have so consistently outperformed bonds that there is now no risk associated with equity investment.
"in other words, because equities are sure to offer higher returns than bonds, the expected yield on equities should be the same as on bonds."
you do not have to be wittgenstein to spot the flaw.
"the rules of logic hold even in cyberspace, and so do the principles of economics."
"profits are hard to earn in competitive businesses, and markets that are not competitive are usually regulated."
the value of companies ultimately depends on their capacity to generate cash for shareholders.
distant returns are uncertain.
"share prices are volatile, and investors need to be compensated for the risks."
these truths are as valid in the new economy as the old.
by all means do the math.

great article on what it truly means to be an auburn man the ties that bind friday night meetings have helped auburn through hard times 10/03/00 by phillip marshall times sports staff auburn - it started in dark and unhappy times for auburn's football team.
five straight games had been lost.
"''whatever happened, we pointed fingers at each other."
"'' on the friday night before last november's game against central florida, a small group of players gathered at the team hotel at the urging of fullback heath evans."
they prayed.
they talked about life and the sometimes bitter turns it can take.
"a bond began to grow among players young and old, black and white, starters and reserves."
it wasn't so much about winning and losing or even about football.
it was about matters of the heart.
"''we may have had 15-20 guys show up that first night,'' senior whip linebacker rob pate said."
"''since then, it's just like another thing on the itinerary."
"it's not mandatory, but we have basically the whole team there."
we've got five or six coaches.
coach tuberville comes in there.
"people just lay out their hearts, whatever is on their minds."
'' auburn has won seven of the eight games it has played since that november night.
players say they've done it with trust and a unity of purpose that has grown ever stronger.
it has carried the 15th-ranked tigers to a 5-0 record going into saturday's southeastern conference west division showdown at 20th-ranked mississippi state.
pate says they'll go firm in the belief that they can count on each other in the most difficult times.
pate knows about pain and even fear.
"a mysterious disease, now seemingly under control, threatened his senior season."
"''when you see a guy at his weakest point and he's reaching out asking you for help, you know everything about a guy,'' pate said."
"''with me, it was my health."
"before the first game, they set a chair in the middle of the room and every guy in there put his hands on me."
we said a prayer together.
"man, i was crying."
''it's like that every weekend.
somebody on this team is suffering through something.
they share it.
"when you line up on saturday, it's a lot easier to look at that person and know he is going to give it everything he's got."
"'' on the field, there has been little but happiness for auburn this season."
"tuberville says it started when auburn players, strengthened by the bad times, put aside their differences and their individual desires to play for their teammates and their school."
"''i've never been around a team this close,'' tuberville said."
''they get along.
"we haven't always played as great as we wanted to, but we've had guys urging the younger players and younger players pulling for the older guys to get better."
''it's just a special group.
they enjoy being around each other and understand what it's going to take for us to win.
"'' the change from not so long ago is striking, simmons says."
"''if you don't really know each other and everybody is in their own little group, things aren't going to work,'' simmons said."
"''if you have trust in your teammates, you can build a good team."
"right now, we've got that going."
"'' it starts with the seniors, who have seen the good and the bad of college football."
they went to the sec championship game as freshmen in 1997.
"then came two losing seasons and the resignation of their head coach, terry bowden."
"they revel in their success, yet they know it can be ever so fleeting."
they take pride in the closeness of a team on the way back.
no one understands better than fifth-year senior quarterback ben leard.
"he went from starter to third team in 1998, then won his job back in 1999 when hardly anyone thought he could."
"today, he has the highest efficiency rating of any sec quarterback."
"''we have been practicing since august and we have yet to hear anyone say 'man, i'm looking forward to playing in the nfl,' '' leard said."
''no one is worried about their personal accolades or how they are doing status-wise.
everybody just wants to win ball games.
the relationships we have on this team are like brothers.
'' leard says nothing that happens can change that.
"''if we lose every game from now on, this will be one of the most special seasons i've ever had in my life,'' leard said."
''we've got people excited.
we're excited.
the fun is back in it for us.
"''it's a great feeling to be able to almost look forward to coming to practice, to see the guys, to have fun and talk."
there are no fingers being pointed anywhere.
there are no individuals on this football team.
"'' evans was one who showed the way, happily accepting the unglamorous role of blocker for tailback rudi johnson."
"every friday night, evans is still the one who leads his teammates as they share their joy and their pain."
"''heath is just like that all the time,'' pate said."
''he's a great example of somebody who lives what he talks.
"he's a role model, not just for younger people but for all of us."
''
thanks.
you are like superwoman...if he was there i  can find him..
i know he was there because i went up and visited a few times my freshman year during breaks.

"contrary to popular belief i am alive...the 22nd works for me too (although given my current work situation i'm sure i'd be late - better late than never, right?)  anyway, both of the current suggestions sound good ( i've been to benji's - great food and heard really good things about ousie's table as well)."

i understand that alot of homes were reduced to rubble with very little left to save.
it was very bad.

les rawson has spoken with doug reiner at willamette regarding this deal.
they are in agreement now about the prices.
"les said he usually has to explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so it's nothing new."
"but in the future, les said he'd prefer to contact the counterparty first to avoid confusion."
his extension is 3924.
you're also more than welcome to call me first and i'll track les down.
"(i think i'm probably easier to get ahold of!) at any rate, i hope this clears it up."
"and if willamette has any other questions, let me know."
"thanks, kate"

"by now, a member of our sap implementation team should have contacted you with information about your role as a timekeeper."
this role is very important at enron.
"by using a single time entry system, we will be able to gather the information we need to better manage our resources and their associated costs."
"time entered impacts payroll, finance and project costs real-time."
"if time is not entered correctly, payroll, financial reports and project costing are negatively impacted."
"we are quickly approaching the first sap time entry deadline of june 30, at 3:00 p.m., cst."
it is critical that we work together to meet this deadline.
"within the next day or so, you will receive information from todd peikert, the site manager for the corporate groups, on what you need to do before june 30th."
several mechanisms have been put in place to support you during time entry periods.
"beginning june 23rd, you can contact the center of expertise (coe) at (713) 345-4sap with any questions or problems you are experiencing."
we appreciate your hard work and support to make our sap implementation a success.

08:18 pm<br>to: houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits you may have recently received communication from united healthcare (uhc) concerning memorial hermann health systems' (mhhs) decision to terminate their contract with uhc  in the houston/beaumont area.
this communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.
it is our intent to help you understand the situation.
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and enron!
"when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, memorial hermann cancelled their contract."
"while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc, enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts."
"at this time, it is only uhc which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well."
"many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those with admission privileges to the woodlands, sugarland and clear lake hospitals, to name a few."
"in a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo options, enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between september 28 and december 31, 2000 as if the termination of the memorial hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in-network benefits applied."
office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.
hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with uhc.
"these steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by primary care physician disruption from 1,050 to 127."
if you need medical attention:  you or your doctor/hospital must call uhc's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.
in some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.
"if this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement."
claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).
open enrollment materials will be coming soon.
take this opportunity to consider your elections for 2001.
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees through this transition.
we will communicate any  further developments that may impact you or your family.
"this memo will confirm our dinner meeting to be held june 21, 2000 at the river oaks grill date    june 21, 2000 place   wine room river oaks grill 2630 westheimer 713/520-1738 time    6:30 pm if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact kay (3x0643) or beverly (5x7857) i will look forward to seeing you there."

he wants to talk with you about this before circling back to knippa.

"re. tw's exposure if we authorize ecs to lock in too early: if tw defaults under the csa, it must hold ecs harmless with regard to expenses incurred by ecs in the assignment of the electric supply agreement and pay ecs whatever is owed under the agreement."
"no other specific damages are addressed, and the agreement specifically prohibits the recovery of consequential, incidental or indirect losses or damages."
"(section 9.2 provides for reimbursement for ecs's reasonable costs in providing compression services, but only in the event tw uses its ferc out.)  the gas conversion agreement provides for termination of the agreement in the event of default by tw under the csa, and obligates tw to reimburse ecs for ecs's costs and expenses incurred in unwinding the forward sale of natural gas volumes to be delivered to ecs under the agreement."

"""attached is my redline of your sat. draft."
"in addition to the revisions in the doc, i have a few questions and concerns: 1."
"on the segmenting section, i think it is a fine legal argument, but it lacks something."
"what is our """"or else"""" position?"
does the global settlement give us any ferc-out rights or colorable argument that the entire deal should be unwound if ferc screws up the segmenting issue?
"i'm not suggesting that we should trigger a ferc out if we have one, but if we arguably do, we should consider threatening to use it."
"i'm afraid we come across as whiny and ferc's position will likely be """"so what, what are you going to do about it?"
""""" if we have no arguable """"ferc-out"""" and the only  """"or else"""" we have is that we'll take them to court and force them to adhere to the original deal, i'm for leaving the draft as-is."
we can make our appeal threat more direct on rehearing if they hose us in the initial order.
2
"on the arbitrage argument, i've taken out any reference to an example and softened the verbiage a bit."
"i want to leave in the references to the arbitrage issue, however, because ferc understands the problem and believes it is widespread."
we don't need to prove exactly how big a problem it is on our system (although it would have been very effective if we had clear facts).
3.  do any of the oba changes arguably conflict with the global settlement?
"if so, we'd  better be prepared to eat our words from the segmenting section."
covering ourselves in the sanctity of that settlement in section 1 and then fiddling around with it in section 2 won't play well.
it is my understanding that the oba system on tw was not part of the turnback resolution deal so i hope this won't be a problem.

the arb opportunity is huge and clear.

what's the right answer?

"parties represented at an informal meeting after the february 7, 2000 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the cac settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement conferences."
transwestern pipeline company submits the following comments in lieu of a redlined document.
transwestern fully supports the cac's proposal of a path-defined receipt point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt points on the socalgas system.
"not only does the proposal satisfy the commission's requirement that hector road be established as a formal receipt point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use of the socalgas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas transportation."
cac's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to socal's system.
transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not been fully described in the cac document.
"to this end, transwestern proposes that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions."
transwestern looks forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.

"guys, we have the following un-allocated turbines (approximately $100m in nominal value): a) 2 power barges - brian - $13m b) 2 abb 11n1 - rob- $35m c) 1 501d5a - janet/chris - $25m d) 1 7ea - janet/chris- $20m all other turbines appear to be allocated to high probability projects."
could you please provide me your plan with these units.
i would like to flatten out our book (ie) ensure there are good homes for or divest of all our existing turbines before we look at purchasing additional units for 2002.

it keeps asking me for additional passwords and domain.
what do i need to enter?

i'll cycle on this and get back to you with=   follow up if any.
i'm going to write a $50 check to charity (juvenille diabetes) if that's ok with you.

hi mark...me again.
you really are missing my presence in the controls group aren't you?
"liz, i can't believe it - although he will never show!"
terry glenn and charlie garner for eddie george?
there is sure alot of scheduled activity where there is no revised completion date or a note that it is completed.
can we get an update?
have fun in san antonio.
it is a very popular spring break destination.
enjoy it!
"phillip:  the changes i would like to make are to promote patti to manager whenever you feel the time is right, and then i am going to recommend stacey for promotion to sr. specialist based on her recent performances."

let me know if we have any problems with this.

"i know you are clarifying it's activities but until then, i have instructed my guys to respond to epower when they call and to discuss events (e.g.:  possible lng re-gas plans for epower) but to make sure and discuss all activities with you as well."
let me know if you want something different or want me to email other instructions.
"thanks, mike"
"need your help on the following: each day we are delayed in finalising var, p&l and positions because the uk must wait for a usd  interest rate curves before submitting their data to houston."
i am also told that it is really not necessary to wait for this curve and the data could be submitted close of business london.
even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it would be better than what we have now.
this would greatly improve the efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management.
can you guys initiate this change or get me to the right person there.

this transaction was a hedge for the acquisition of the paper plant we announced recently.

here's the latest version: kay
here you go cynthia.
i feel pretty confident that everything is correct this month.
"however, i'm sure i'm being overly optimistic on that front so call or email me with any changes."
i entered this deal in the system with the wrong term date.
i entered this as a dec-00 deal.
the term is 11/23 - 11/30/2000.
my fault.
i corrected sitara.
i think the easiest way is a power of attorney.
"i've talked to deb korkmas about it (i hear she's the one to handle such things), and i've asked kathleen to identify the most active development entities so that we deal with as many as possible at once."
"as for the expense account, i figure she can just tell ben to sign her name to the reports."
any other ideas?
kay
"john, thanks for the email."

"since the time frame is short, i wanted to give you an outline to mark up/correct."
here's how i understand the deal: people's has the manlove gas storage facility.
"we have presented to people's a nonphysical method to monetize it, similar to what was done with bammel."
"since this is a regulated asset, regulatory approval will be required, and the consumers will receive part of the benefit of the monetization."
"the essence of our deal is that enron will receive 50% of the net earnings, up to $25mm, as our fee."
"in consideration for this fee, enron takes the financial, legal, accounting and engineering lead."
peoples and enron will work together on the regulatory strategy formulation and implementation.
we want to present a draft mou to peoples this week.
"the basic goals are: define scope of the agreement define our lead role in the 4 stated areas create exclusivity for enron define financial arrangements (cost/profit) get an acknowledgement that what was presented to them was proprietary, and covered by our confidentiality agreement."
"define term (5 years) each party bears their own internal costs, and third party costs are split 50/50, with prior approval."
in that regard an immediate concern is getting the engineering work kicked off.
we want the agreement broad enough to cover physical withdrawals.
"we do not want it specific to this field, since we want the benefit of the use of our methodology."
"please correct/supplement, etc. thanks, kay"
"corina, are the times the same for the super saturday on nov.4?"

"despite annual struggles with algebra and geometry, she signed up for both physics and pre-calc!!!"
i don't know what she was thinking!!
"amazingly, for a school as large as klein, i was persuasive enough with the assistant principal that they will ignore the july 22 deadline for changing your schedule and they will let her drop physics and add a study hall."
"she still will take pre-calc, but she is in a regulars class that will be a review of algebra ii during the first semester, which is probably exactly what she needs."
"i was prepared to go all the way to the school board if necessary to get her a schedule that makes sense, but luckily i didn't have to go that far."
hope that you have a good weekend!

jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly.

"todd's tendency (remember this with weather, too) is to think that he has to do all of the work himself."
"he has had enough experience that his organization, guidance and leadership can be very valuable without his doing all of the work himself."
"if james' list looks long and involved, how could todd lead these efforts, what kind of team might he ask james to provide, what additional short-term resources might we be able to tap into in houston, etc.  we have to think a little out of the box to offer a potential solution to james."
"if you are willing, i would be glad to explore this with todd and challenge him to think about how he could provide leadership to the effort, but not do all of the work."

"""dear tom, enron would be interested in getting together with other trading partners to discuss listing other index points at the socal border."
i think the market requires other postings to reflect the fundamental changes in the market with respect to transportation constraints.
the market has clearly seen a divergence in the summer spreads between pg&e and socal interconnects.
"the marginal generation load in sp-15 and southern california this summer has proven that socal gas is short delivered gas and is incapable of meeting daily demand with flowing supplies, and will be incapable of injecting gas during these months."
"because of this, supply being transported from the southwest supply basins can only find a home going into pg&e.  this places downward pressure on pg&e topock gas and upward pressure on socal topock gas."
"remember, socal is an island, not because of the delivered capacity to the border via epng and tw, but because of the limited capacity of socal's interconnects."
demand exceeds the supply interconnect capacity.
there is also a divergence between ehrenberg and topock because of liquidity.
topock is a more liquid market because of the upstream transport contracts on epng and downstream buying patterns of certain socal markets.
the market is more diversified at topock than ehrenberg.
the overwhelming demand pressure on socal gets exposed at topock.
"although ehrenberg is the marginal point for gas into socal, there is more of an imbalance in upstream capacity (epng and tw) to downstream capacity (socal topock 545,000/d) at socal topock than at ehrenberg."
the socal ehrenberg interconnect has 1.1 bcf of capacity and is primarily sourced by one market transporter.
"ehrenberg simply gets placed at """"market prices"""" because of varying objectives."
"one transporter may place gas to larger buyers to ensure flows, while smaller buyers on socal may not approach this transporter for supplies."
this illiquidity has led to a spread existing between topock and ehrenberg.
"picture  the market, san juan gas is trading well below the permian and waha basins, which happen to be the marginal supply points for the west."
"because of the of the limited capacity going into socal topock, every transporter on epng and tw wants to fill their contracts with san juan gas first."
these molecules compete for buyers at a limited delivery interconnect.
"likewise, all buyers reach out for supply coming through a limited delivery interconnect (topock)."
the san juan then trys to find an outlet going east on the sj east leg of epng.
this transport leg simply displaces permian gas going into plains north and allows permian gas to head west to ehrenberg on the epng south mainline.
"while the socal market peaks in the summer, so does the eoc demand."
permian west (keystone west meter)  cannot satisfy both the eoc demand and the socal demand.
"so for the first time ever, we saw epng waha west at maximum capacity to source transport contracts on the epng south mainline."
this tells the entire story.
"when demand exceeds all available historical supply points, and begins to reach to waha to meet ehrenberg demand, you have a paradigm shift."
this eliminates any correlation that may have existed between the supply basins and the market area.
"when keystone west reaches maximum capacity, the rule of market spreads not exceeding the max rate transport rate then dies a fast death."
there is simply no available capacity at the keystone west meter to allow a shipper to buy max rate transport on epng and ship it to socal.
"if you asked the market what the maximum interconnect capacity at keystone west is, 9 out of 10 would not know."
this leads to blaming market participants for wide spreads that are above historical levels.
"it is like al gore blaming """"big oil companies"""" for the high prices of gas, when all refineries are at maximum capacity."
there simply isn't the capacity to meet demand.
"the supply exists, but there isn't enough refining capacity available to meet demand."
fundamentals rule the market in all cases.
i would like to propose the following index points for the southern california border.
the market would  be better served with supply being included in these index points.
"one, socal ca production/socal storage/epng ehrenberg, two, topock tw and epng, three, krs/wheeler ridge."
the market will be experiencing more changes with respect to the socal restructuring in the future.
we will then address the different interconnects and propose an index for the socal citygate as well.

"""guys, i would like your opinion on this potential transaction."
this has been sold through ge for some time and it is reasonably likely that if we employed some additional resources that this could be completed over the next quarter or so.
"ultimately, rodney and his team would like to see ees take control of the deal with eim folks staying involved to ensure continuity and to assist to closure."
"assuming that the sales process is largely completed, i see some value for enron to take this deal including: a) $200 m in tcv for 2000; b) $3 to $5 m in value; c) ge on our ees resume of companies which will help in future sales to the large industrial customers; and d) provides an """"in"""" to the ge family of companies which could result in significant up-sell capability in the future if we provide a quality product."

hickerson always claims that they have var by trader.
"""you had a question about the meaning of section 4.3."
here's a brief explanation.
section 4.2 covers indemnification in case one party gets sued by a third party for damage caused by negligence of the other party.
"i'm ok with eliminating """"stockholders"""" and the """"."
"..judgments of any nature..."""" clause you two spoke about on the phone as long as they come out of both subparagraphs a. and b. section 4.3 needs to stay in because it covers any potential action by epfs against tw for damage to epfs's facilities during the term of the agreement."
"tw is already obligated elsewhere in the agreement to construct and operate the facilities in accordance with industry practice, tariff and dot standards."
"our policy in interconnect agreements is that if tw complies with these standards we should not then somehow be liable for damage to epfs in case of explosion, etc.  in other words, both parties bear the risk attached to something unforeseeable going wrong notwithstanding use of industry and dot standards."
"(by the way, i believe the """"notwithstanding anything in this article 4 to the contrary"""" language should come out; i'm not sure why it's in the draft.) any questions -- please e-mail or call (713-853-0596)."

effective immediately we are changing the way we handle deliveries to oglethorpe on transco.
current process ena sales gas to oglethorpe at st 85 ena buys gas from epmi (deal 318335) at st 85 at gas daily ena sells gas back to epmi at doyle plant at gas daily plus variable cost.
"new process ena sells gas to oglethorpe at st 85 (deal 329314, baseload deal  and deal 318423, gas daily deal) ena does an exchange buy (deal 338732) at st 85."
"curretly, this volume will match the sale to oglethorpe at st 85 ena does an exchange sell (deal 338735), volume on this deal will be the amount on deal 338732 less z4 to z4 fuel."
congrats john

i have 2 storage questions for now.
1
cove point lng - it's my understanding that this is a lng peaking facility.
"the current balance is 1,500,000 dth."
did you have a withdrawal schedule or were you going to use this as peaking gas?
2
"tco contract 63304 - has capacity of 7 bcf, and i think your current storage balance is about 5 bcf."
what is your withdrawal schedule for jan??

"i'm a changed man, after this is all over, jerry and i are going to buy motorcycles and take a bike trip."
"when the commission granted texas eastern authority to hold capacity on another pipeline in texas eastern transmission corporation, 74 ferc p 61,074 (1996), it stated that when a pipeline holds capacity on an upstream pipeline, the downstream pipeline's customers may hold title to the gas transported on the upstream pipeline."
the commission recognized this as one of the limited exceptions to the shipper must have title rule.
"specifically, the commission stated: the downstream pipeline will not hold title to gas shipped on capacity it has acquired on an upstream pipeline."
"rather, shippers on the downstream pipeline will hold title to the gas on the upstream pipeline."
"we will allow a pipeline to hold the upstream capacity; we will not, however, allow the pipeline to hold title to the gas being shipped."
"thus, the downstream pipeline will be the shipper on the upstream pipeline, but will not hold title when the gas is being shipped."
this results in a limited exception to the rule that a shipper must hold title to gas being shipped.
"i believe that if we can address the commission's other concerns about this filing, they will grant a similar waiver for this transaction."
you can feel free to pass this along to your contact at pnm.

"""gore good for health-care, fuel cells by deborah adamson, cbs."
"marketwatch.com last update: 9:36 am et oct 31, 2000 newswatch latest headlines new york (cbs."
"mw) - as election day nears, a key question confronting investors is how each presidential candidate will affect the stock market."
"at no other time in u.s. history is such a question so pertinent, with about half of all households owning equities."
"in this article, cbs."
marketwatch.com identifies sectors that will get a boost under an al gore presidency.
"on wednesday, we'll examine the impact if george w. bush wins."
see our full election coverage.
"today on cbs marketwatch nasdaq stages early rally; dow gains ntt docomo said eyeing at&t wireless stake european bourses bouyed by chemicals, industrial shares calandra: broadband's luster dims stocks in broad advance across asia more top stories... cbs marketwatch columns updated: 10/31/2000 9:37:46 am?"
"et first, a caveat: despite the campaign rhetoric, analysts said, a president has less direct impact on the stock market than do the economic cycle, the stock market cycle, the oil cartel, the global economy, the strength of the u.s. dollar, interest rates and many other influences."
"as such, giving any administration sole or main credit for a bull or bear market would be misleading."
"where the government has greater influence is in such things as military spending and, more critically, the choice of fed chairman, said arnold kaufman, editor of the s&p outlook, an investment publication published by standard & poor's."
investors also should remember that campaign promises don't always work out.
"that said, analysts have identified sectors that either could benefit under gore, or that historically have done well under democrats."
"capital goods if democrats live up to their """"big spender"""" image, kaufman said, expect a rise in infrastructure spending."
"that means an impact on the communications and transportation, among other sectors."
"his favorite stocks here include sanmina corp. (sanm: news, msgs), a maker of electronic components for equipment makers, and tyco (tyc: news, msgs), a diversified electronics and industrial company."
"sanmina makes electronic components and cables for equipment manufacturers in the communications, industrial, medical and high-speed computer markets."
"last week, merrill lynch chose sanmina as one of top 10 tech stocks that are expected to outperform in the next six to 12 months."
"in the fourth quarter, sanmina's earnings before one-time charges more than doubled from the like period in 1999, beating wall street's consensus estimate by 10 cents."
revenue almost doubled to $1.27 billion.
"company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings."
"tyco sells to the telecommunications, electronics, health-care, industrial goods and fire and security services markets."
"tyco recently completed the acquisition of mallinckrodt, a specialty medical products maker, boosting its position in the respiratory care arena."
"fourth-quarter earnings before extraordinary items rose by 40 percent to $1.1 billion, or 64 cents a share, from a year ago."
sales went up by 25 percent to $7.8 billion.
"company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings."
"earlier this month, legg mason raised its rating on tyco to """"buy"""" from """"market performance."""
""" elizabeth mackay, chief investment strategist at bear stearns, includes tyco on her recommended list."
"mortgage lenders a gore presidency could end an action by some lawmakers to sever these lenders' lines of credit from the u.s. treasury, said erik gustafson, senior portfolio manager for liberty growth stock fund."
the argument for severance is that these congressionally chartered lenders have an unfair advantage over other banking and mortgage lenders.
"in addition, the sec's new fair disclosure regulation can be expected to boost companies with reliable earnings growth, according to bear stearns."
"stocks expected to do well in this environment include fannie mae (fnm: news, msgs) and freddie mac (fre: news, msgs), bear stearns said."
"fannie mae, or the federal national mortgage association, and freddie mac, the federal home loan mortgage corp., buy conventional home mortgages from banks and mortgage bankers and sells them as securities."
"fannie mae: company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings."
"freddie mac: company profile, latest financials, and analysts' ratings."
health care providers an increase in government spending on medicare should boost stocks in this sector.
"warren isabelle, president of ironwood capital management, likes nursing home operator beverly enterprises (bev: news, msgs)."
"last week, ing barings raised its rating on beverly enterprises to """"buy"""" from """"hold."""
""" beverly enterprises recently reported a second-quarter profit, reversing a loss from 1999."
the company's business is improving because of increased revenue from medicare and medicaid.
"however, beverly has taken a hit lately because it's adding $50 million to its reserves for patient liability costs for 2000."
"alternative energy sources in his book, """"earth in the balance,"""" gore called for the gradual elimination of the internal combustion engine and espoused other environmental beliefs."
"as such, alternative energy stocks should do well under his presidency, specifically fuel cell companies, said jim lowell, chief portfolio strategist for adviser investments management."
"one stock he likes is fuelcell energy (fcel: news, msgs)."
fuelcell develops electrochemical technologies that generate electricity without combustion.
"last week, friedman billings ramsey raised its rating on fuelcell to """"accumulate,"""" following chase h&q's upgrade to """"buy"""" earlier in the month."
"fuelcell also has allied with enron (ene: news, msgs) to develop and sell fuelcell's direct fuelcel products."
enron has invested $5 million in the company.
"company profile, latest financials, analysts' ratings."
what about tech stocks?
"here, analysts have mixed feelings."
"kaufman believes both candidates would be good for the sector in general, but gustafson disagrees, citing the worsening of the regulatory environment in the last eight years and the antitrust action against microsoft (msft: news, msgs)."
"lowell thinks gore's impact would be neutral to negative, but analyst safa rashtchy of us bancorp piper jaffray said the democrat could be good for net stocks."
"gore vs. bush portfolios thus far, gore is ahead of bush, based on a basket of stocks pegged to each candidate's possible presidency."
"since sept. 1, lisa kammert, an analyst at birinyi associates, has been tracking two portfolios comprising 12 stocks each that would do well under gore or bush."
"as of monday, gore's portfolio has outperformed bush's by 4.43 percent, based on a simple average of each stock's return."
"in 1992, the same model accurately predicted a clinton win."
"in the gore portfolio are amazon.com, yahoo, citigroup, bank of america, disney, time warner, bellsouth, duke energy, tenet healthcare, procter & gamble, coca-cola and waste management."
"in bush's basket are ibm, microsoft, exxon mobil, transocean sedco, merrill lynch, bristol myers, w.r. grace, beazer homes, philip morris and boeing."
"going into the last week before the election, gore has outpaced bush most of the time since sept. 1."
"as for job growth, a study by executive recruiter challenger, gray & christmas indicates that a gore administration would boost employment for the mass transit sector, education, health care, construction (homes and schools), agriculture, lawyers, insurance, law enforcement, commercial banking and forestry.?"

"the most significant change is that it is clear that the option payment is not refundable, and will not be applied against the purchase price."

what do you want for randy moss?
don't forget to chat with vng about nabisco.
vng should have released 700 dth of cgas capacity to nabisco effective 11/1/2000 - 10/31/2001.
nabisco was not set up as a prearranged bidder at the time.
"during nov bidweek for dec, nabisco asked me to release the capacity."
"since the term was less than 1 year, i couldn't release the capacity non-biddable."
i spoke to jeff huston about it early last week and he said he would get back to me.
dick suggested i tell you.
"tagg - you're it, i will await your command."
mr. scott goodell said we could release the capacity for 1 year eff 1/1/2001 and then recall nov and dec.
more questions: we have two different levels of guarantee values.
"we have the specific performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc.  this includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and discharge)."
will all of these have  more stringent guaranteed levels that fce will have to work to try to fix?
i'm assuming there are no sound issues.
"thanks again, kay"

10.2 effect of force majeure.
"in the event of a force majeure event  affecting seller=01,s ability to deliver scheduled energy from the facility= , the  following shall occur:   (a) seller shall as soon as reasonably practicable use commercially  reasonable efforts to fulfill its obligations to deliver scheduled energy=   from market sources until notice is provided pursuant to section 10.2(b)  below.  do we want to delete this?"
gary didn't seem to like it.
"(b) not later than ten (10) days following the onset of the force majeure=   event, seller shall (i) issue a notice to buyer stating whether seller will=   continue to fulfill its obligations to buyer hereunder from market sources=   until the force majeure event is terminated or (ii) declare force majeure a= nd  relieve buyer from its obligation to pay the demand charge during the time=   that seller is unable to meet its obligations hereunder, computed on a dail= y  basis."
"if buyer does not schedule energy during the ten (10) day evaluatio= n  period and seller declares force majuere, then  buyer=01,s relief of the  obligation to pay the demand charge shall commence as of the date of the  force majeure event."
"(c) if, during the ten (10) day evaluation period referenced above, buyer=   schedules energy and seller continues to deliver energy, but then declares=   force majeure, buyer=01,s relief from the obligation to pay the demand char= ge  shall commence on the date of the declaration of force majeure and not on t= he  date of onset of the force majeure event."
"if, during the ten (10) day  evaluation period buyer schedules energy and seller initially delivers ener= gy  but subsequently fails to deliver, buyer shall be relieved of the obligatio= n  to pay the demand charge from the date seller fails to deliver energy, and=   not on the date of onset of the force majeure event."
such relief from the=   demand charge shall be computed on a daily basis.
"in the event of a force majeure affecting buyer=01,s ability to receive ene= rgy  from seller, payment of the demand charge shall continue."
10.3 termination due to force majeure.
"if an event of force majeure continu= es  in effect for twelve (12) consecutive months, then the party not declaring=   force majeure may terminate this agreement upon providing written notice of=   such termination to the other party (but if such event of force  majeure  terminates before any such termination notice is provided, then this  agreement shall continue in full force and effect)."

goal: total foreign exchange exposure quantified and communicated to bod.
performance: project completed with final tranche of results reported to finance committee dec 11.
the notional exposure as well as impact on potential impact on earnings and cta accounts have been quantified and reported to the bod over the past year according to a schedule that has strictly adhered to.
"also, a template and process has been established to be able to easily report changes in the future."
enron has never had a comprehensive review of fx exposure prior to this activity.
"as an aside, there has been a fair amount of hedging activity resulting from this effort."
goal: establish risk and trading control processes for risks unique to ees.
performance: systems have been established and monitoring controls are in place across ees.
a thorough study of the dsm business has been completed and the results presented to the finance committee.
a rac task force has been put in place which has established a work plan consisting of 53 elements that ees has agreed to put in place to get the overall back office and trading and credit control systems where they need to be.
significant progress has been made against these recommendations.
dsm projects have been spot tested with outside measurement firm and the results reported to ees.
these tests have highlighted focus areas to determine where the capital dollars are best employed.
goal: solidify the global risk management policy beyond houston and london.
performance: complete and ongoing.
"during 2000, project doorstep was initiated by rac which inspected every office within enron to determine if trading was taking place and if so whether the enron controls were being adhered to."
a data base system was developed to routinely prompt surprise inspections of these offices and also monitor if the recommendations are being adhered to.
"doorstep was a huge effort involving rac, aa, and operations to really understand where we have risks."
"it also helps in defining where we don't have responsibility such as eott,  azurix  and the new power company."

we don't have a very big opportunity here!
tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.
"not that i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should put as market size?"
"nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?"
what do you think?
i do not think i will be able to do the conference call tomorrow.
there will be a meeting to discuss the plant visits at 1:00 pm today!

"""i'll be needing a """"significant other"""" for the party.  do you have any spares?"

"""hey greg, i enjoyed interviewing with both you and jim last week friday."
i would like to talk to you some more about the opportunities available in enron networks.
"two areas i thought would be interesting would either be helping to structure a market for enron networks to enter, or help develop a market that enron networks is in the process of entering."
"a couple of things that i thought were interesting about your strategy for b2b is that unlike most business plans where the strategy is build the site and the volume will come, enron uses it's own volume to entice other people to participate."
"what most e-commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating process, but in reality this has very little value added unless the market is coupled with a finance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivary system for physical goods."
we addressed some of these issues in the ilogex business plan.
i have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce.
i look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning.

i just received a call from damon sykes at national fuel.
"he said we have positive balance of 797,464 on our fss  contract, and we have a balance of (797,163) on our iss."

i don't even know dave so i wouldn't judge him.
i just worry about you being with someone that has a bad temper like that.
you know eventually that temper might be aimed at you.
i know you can take care of yourself and i am sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't mean i can't worry about ya.
:)
so i didn't go anywhere last night.
i am feeling pretty sick and burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in until about 12 last night.
i haven't talked to him yet today and last time i talked to him i told him i had plans tonight which have been changed.
i would like to go out with him but i don't really feel like drinking and i am really trying to cut back on it.
this thing with my dad has really scared me about drinking and bieng more healthy.
i am not pretending that i am going to stop drinking i just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on it.
there is no need for me to get as drunk as i did last weekend.
boy is that a great story!
if i do go out with burns tonight should i call you?
i would like to thank all of you for the opportunity to discuss the real time position with me today.
i am very excited about the opportuniy and i am looking forward to becoming a valuable asset to real time and enron as a whole.
i am confident the position would be an excellent fit.
if you have any further questions please feel free to contact me.
i am looking forward to your positive response.
thanks again mark a guzman

"abb has not had a good experience with an enron llc arrangement, and the contract allows for them to request payment security."
"unless they are convinced that they aren't at risk, they will want some form of payment security."
the contract does allow for the equipment to be paid off (except retainage) to facilitate the assignment.
"mike is available thursday to discuss these issues, and how to get the break out contracts closed."
i'm available any time.

"donnie, for july, adjust the clinton volume to match the purchases from phillips and power gas marketing - do not send out an invoice adjustment."
i may need to change the price on the sale to clinton so that our receivables are netting to 0.
"for august, september, october, and november, make the clinton volumes match the phillips and power gas marketing supply and do send an invoice adjustment to clinton."
"paul, let me know if you have questions."
"for july, the imbalance is actually in ces's pool and i have no idea how to adjust that."
"for august forward, i believe we should just bill you for the actual metered production volumes since the imbalance will be in clinton's pool."
let me know if you want to make any price adjustments - knock a nickel off the price - i just want these deals to go away.
"oh yeah, and make clinton a lot of money!"
"john, i previously asked you to quantify the global size of your business (in billions) and you sent me a voice mail on it."

"guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ena 2001 expense budget."
please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are appropriate to hit the net ena target.
"in order to stay flat year on year, i split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups."
"as we had discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units and will be tracked on the ena income statement below the line and the accountability managed by each of you."
"all outside variable costs, specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  i look at this cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business and evaluate/manage our risks."
"wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for each group with these changes."

"""drew, i wanted you to be aware of a potential dispute with regard to our consultant, mark baldwin of igs."
"our consulting agreement with igs (which has now terminated) provided for a flat fee, plus an incentive fee calculated using the net present value of any contract """"identified by igs"""" and entered into during the term of the consulting agreement."
"during the term of the agreement, tw entered into its gallup expansion agreement with southern."
igs is now claiming it brought in the deal and so is entitled to an incentive fee.
"while it is undisputed that mark discussed the deal with southern, southern was also on lorraine's list of shippers to contact for gallup expansion capacity."
"also, the capacity was posted for all to see."
"so, while mark can certainly claim he """"identified"""" the deal, he was not alone in doing so."
steve is going to call mark in response to his letter (after he talks to lorraine to verify facts).
our thinking is that if we offer igs some money they will be happy.
we would really like to preserve what has been a good working relationship with this consultant.
"on the other hand, i think we could probably take the position that they are not entitled to any incentive fee."
"however, since the contract is silent as to whether igs has to be the only party bringing in the deal in order to qualify for the incentive fee, this position is not as strong as i'd like it to be, and igs might sue tw."
"the amount in dispute could be as much as $200,000, depending on what rate we use in calculating net present value."
"if you have any problem with our offering to pay part of the incentive fee to igs, let me know."
"i think it will be very important for steve not to admit that mark helped in any way in getting the deal -- just in case they do decide to take us to court."""
the meeting has been switched to 2:00pm over near room 3125 - tba.
let me know if this doesn't work for any of you.
thanks ben

"richardson, bettis, and chrebet for freeman 3 starters for 1"
britt- great memo.
"i'm sure you guys are in the course of discussing these very issues, but here's my two cents worth."
1
"once we decide on an optimal forum, the key step before filing a lawsuit is the assessment of our probability of success--for different reasons than is usually the case."
"we need to weigh the chances of a favorable judgment against el paso against the probability and extent of collateral damage to our defense (not just tw but all of gpg) in quinque, et al. 2."
"i like our case a lot based on what i've seen so far--if i've got it right, our claim is that el paso breached the 1990 measurement agreement by not calibrating the meters as required and therefore by allowing the error to arise and remain uncorrected for so long."
"under the nm statute, we may get 6 years worth of recovery ( or more, i guess, if they did something to toll the sol)."
"under the texas sol, maybe less.  do we have a good argument that the 1% standard in the measurement agreement and the 2% standard in el paso's tariff do not absolve them of conversion or breach liability?"
seems to me that el paso will argue that the ferc tariff preempts our contract rights--but i think the law is on our side there.
3
the tricky issue then becomes whether our prosecution of the claim against el paso plays into the hands of our adversaries on the quinque mess.
"if so, how do we quantify that risk to allow a rational balancing of the pros and cons.  i'm glad smart guys like you two will have to do that thinking."
"as usual, i'll try to stay on the sidelines and nod intelligently when you make a recommendation."
df ps:  i'm ok with the outside counsel recommendation.
update.
spoke with the lawyer yesterday.
we can't buy don out right now.
"we need to turn in the final inventory list, get things resolved with mary (be it good or bad) then we can buy don out."
she still thinks that we won't have any issues with mary.
"after we provide the inventory list, she wants me to meet with her (joal), mary, and mary's lawyer to see what we need to do to get this conflict resolved."
