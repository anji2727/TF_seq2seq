"""we did not answer protests to our order 637 filing."
the gist of pnm's protest in rp00-626 is that we shouldn't be able to charge a transport or fuel fee for our imbalance netting and trading service.
i agree with pnm that our tariff language is vague in this regard.

can someone help me with this?
"since we really did not want to make this compliance filing anyway, i would say we probably wouldn't mind if ferc rejected our tariff sheet outright."
"however, it's more likely that they will just instruct us to clarify our language."
"or they could tell us to remove the """"subject to transportation and fuel"""" provision."
"if we want to preserve our right to charge transport and fuel, it might be worthwhile filing something in the way of an answer."
"however, i am going to need some assistance in understanding what the language means and why we think we can do it, so i can justify it to ferc."

"joe, any interest in speaking?"
i have been working with ramona and lorraine to make system adjustments to tw's lft arising from conclusions made at a northern lft meeting a few weeks ago.
"one change that has been called for is that if a limited day is called (for now let's say a total limited day, without notifying shippers of any percentages), no lft can flow at any time during that day but the lft shipper would have the option to flow it to the extent space is available."
"if a limited day were called notifying shippers that only a certain percentage would flow, lft shippers would be able to flow that percentage, and the rest could be scheduled it."
drew latched onto this when i mentioned it to him and wanted to debate this change with me.
"as currently configured, tw's system would allow lft shippers to put in nominations on a limited day, and if any lft capacity were in fact available that lft would be scheduled."
"similarly, if tw were to notify shippers of a partial limited day (say 50%), and 60% of the capacity in fact became available, tw's system (today) would allow lft shippers to put their nominations in and flow 60%, not limit them to 50%."
"tw's tariff language appears suitably vague to allow this --  a limited day is defined as a day on which tw may choose not to schedule service in whole or in part, and the billing section has a provision for limited days on which any quantity of gas is transported."
"our question was whether, by changing tw's lft system as described in the first paragraph, we wouldn't be leaving some firm transportation revenue on the table (because the it rate is generally lower than our firm rate)."
"if so, is the change necessary for some other reason?"
please let me know what you think.

it's funny the spreads in gas.
"first, in gas, you can play the seasonality game."
does anybody want to buy m/n at 1 back.
"no, of course not."
"but in crude, m/n at ."
10 back is normal.
definitely a game as you try to keep month on month spreads somewhat within reason while preserving year on year spreads and creating equilibrium for where cal 2 on back hedging and spec demand is.
that's why cal 2 is as high as it is.
when was the last time the most bullish part of the nat gas curve was prompt month.
i can't remember w/o looking at charts.
it's always the mentality of:
"quentin, i forwarded your resume to our sydney office with a request to invite you for an introductory interview."

enjoy the trip.
two of our most fun vacations were at south seas planatation on captiva island.
sorry that i didn't have time to respond to your e:mail from last week.
it will be great if you can use some of the baby stuff.
"yes, the bed and changing table match -- maple with a small amount of blue (not bright) trim on the bed and maple only on the changing table."
"our bedding could probably go either way, boy or girl."
"if i remember correctly, the bumpers are red ticking trimmed in blue chambray and the dust skirt is red ticking with blue chambray and red bandana trim."
it's not as loud as it sounds - just take a look when you are here.
we also have a beautiful cradle (with bedding) for you to look at and a great baby swing.
"as the baby gets older, we also have an entertainer - now takes the place of what we used to call walkers."
"i am mailing you a martha stewart magazine on babies (yes, she does those, too!), as well as several cataloges that we get that have cute nursery items in them."
"yes, good news on dad."
i hope that in the next few weeks that his medication will kick in and he will see some improvement.
it is highly likely that the infection could be a cause of many symptoms that he has had.
it is just great to have a good diagnosis and the proper treatment started.
i think that he dodged a bullet on this one.
we will look forward to seeing you and chris for thanksgiving.
no big plans yet.
i assume that everyone will be here by at least wednesday night.
i have ordered a birthday cake from rj goodies to help celebrate all november birthdays that evening.
am hoping that mom and dad may come over on tuesday so that we can do some fun things on wednesday during the day (always a great day to shop while everyone else is home getting ready for thanksgiving!).
i will have the whole week off from work.

i have made continental my airline of choice for as long as i can remember booking my own travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.
"this morning, however, i had a very bad experience."
i booked tickets for a vacation back on september 4th for a trip from houston to new york on december 1.
"since i booked the ticket, i became pregnant and found out from my doctor last week that i will still be unable to travel on december 1st due to complications with my pregnancy."
"my doctor indicated to me that i may not be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in june."
"i spoke to leroy peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on september 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time i book a ticket for me or my husband."
i understand that this is the same policy that you would have given me if i had just decided that i didn't feel like taking a vacation this weekend.
"in my opinion, this is an unacceptable policy in the event of medical complications."
"as you can see with my situation, it is unlikely that my husband and i will be able to plan a vacation by september of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month old child."
i repeatedly asked leroy if there was anyone else who could help me or anyone i could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your policy.
i indicated that i could provide a doctor's note if necessary.
"he was very rude to me, stating """"you don't have to ask me 7 different times for the same thing - i already told you no!""""  i had to cancel a flight for work about a month ago on southwest airlines for the same reason, but i was hoping that i would be able to fly again by now."
"for your information, your competitor was very helpful."
"they accepted my doctor's note, gave me a credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another person's name if i am still unable to use it."
that ticket was also booked as a non-refundable fare.
"although i have always used continental  for my personal travel, the treatment i have had in this difficult time has definitely made me second-guess my future choices."
"if there is anything you can do to help, i would greatly appreciate it."""

08:18 pm<br>to: houston area employees participating in the domestic medical plan benefits you may have recently received communication from united healthcare (uhc) concerning memorial hermann health systems' (mhhs) decision to terminate their contract with uhc  in the houston/beaumont area.
this communication also included the names of physicians who will be dropped from the network due to this action.
it is our intent to help you understand the situation.
it is our understanding that memorial herman health systems asked for a 40% increase in fees - a substantial increase that would have been passed on to you and enron!
"when united healthcare attempted to negotiate with a counter proposal, memorial hermann cancelled their contract."
"while this contractual arrangement was between the hospital system and uhc, enron continues to support uhc in their ongoing contract negotiation efforts."
"at this time, it is only uhc which has been affected, however, it is our understanding that cigna has also been contacted by the hospital group and may be in contract negotiations at this time as well."
"many doctors have obtained admission privileges to other area hospitals within the uhc network or have contracted directly with uhc including those with admission privileges to the woodlands, sugarland and clear lake hospitals, to name a few."
"in a further effort to limit disruption to our affected employees and families who are enrolled in the uhc network or epo options, enron has authorized uhc to process claims incurred between september 28 and december 31, 2000 as if the termination of the memorial hermann health systems from the network had not occurred and in-network benefits applied."
office visits will have a $10 copayment and all other charges will be covered at 90%.
hospital admissions will still need to be pre-certified with uhc.
"these steps have decreased the number of participants' affected by primary care physician disruption from 1,050 to 127."
if you need medical attention:  you or your doctor/hospital must call uhc's customer service number so proper benefits can be verified.
in some cases the hospital or doctor may request payment at the time service is performed.
"if this should happen, please obtain an itemized statement and submit it to uhc with a claim form for prompt reimbursement."
claim forms can be obtained by calling 1-800-332-7979 or in houston at 713-853-7979 ( press 1).
open enrollment materials will be coming soon.
take this opportunity to consider your elections for 2001.
united healthcare and enron hr are committed to assisting enron employees through this transition.
we will communicate any  further developments that may impact you or your family.
i can cancel the other meeting vince

mike mcconnell asked me to contact you to set up a 30 minute appointment with him and jeff shankman for next week..
"please let me know if you will be available at 4:30 p.m. on tuesday, 10/17, or 3:30 p.m. or 4:"
"allyson, will the certification of necessity be specific to ena?"
i ask this because i suspect that at some point we will want a special purpose company to be involved.
this provides us with the option of selling the equity of the entity developing the project.
your advise is appreciated.

i would strongly support his movement into either serc or ecar as per our earlier discussion.
i hope to be moving several experienced dealmakers into the gas and power mid-market groups to increase our deal-making skills and relationships in those markets.
i would also hope to move a reasonable number of new associates (that only rotate within trading and mid-market) to the various desks.
the goal is  to increase the bench strength of the trading and mid-market groups plus support john's iniatives on the fundamental groups.

"""drew -- here is lorraine's update on the val verde situation that i mentioned in my previous e-mail."
recall that we've been unable to accept quantities of gas from burlington because of the high temperatures at the interconnect in recent years.
i've recommended that we seek amendment of the contract as soon as possible to reflect what we can do.
"the proposed amendment lorraine is referring to, which burlington rejected, modified our obligation to provide firm compression sufficient to accept 250,000 mmbtu."
// burlington resources - val verde plant - michelle and i had a follow-up conversation with br thursday.
i faxed the proposed amendment to br monday and we hadn't heard from them yet.
"they claim approximately $135,000/month in lost revenues because we are holding their production down."
michele and darrell will work to pull together the data on exactly which days we have not been able to take br's gas.
"i mentioned to br that we were putting this info together, but they claim since they were told to back off to 180,000 - 190,000 mmbtu from about mid-june through july, our data would not accurately reflect br's inability to schedule in excess of 180/190."
"they will not accept our wording in the interconnect amendment, specifically """"best efforts"""" and """"subject to operating conditions on tw"""", so we will need to revise this further."
we offered alternate receipt point flexibility at ignacio and alternate delivery point flexibility at el paso blanco on their jackrabbit contract but they do not think this is sufficient to agree to amend the interconnect agreement.
"they have suggested we consider giving them a deeper discount on their san juan - waha contract (80,000/d, $0.14, term 11/30/06)."

i just finished having lunch with tobin and he filled me in a bit about this morning's meeting.
"i don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc. but i wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation."
whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in the best and most open manner possible.
in no way can or should your conduct be called into question.
bearing that in mind any criticism that was expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.
i am sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those being criticized.
"furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will inevitably open."
"there isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when they come along (which is exactly what you've done)."
keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.

here is the abb contract you referenced in your email.
i am working on a 97-10 compliant epc contract for nepco/eecc.
"however, i wonder about the challenges presented with the need for nepco to enter into subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all the way down the line."
this is a very tall order given the contracting environment.
"your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion."

"sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but i just checked my email."

it sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and reflecting.
i think it healthy to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.
"this better understanding, i find, typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more happiness in life."
"however, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair."
"we all have regrets, but these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the long run."

"hi guys, in looking at crra's comments to the draft loi."
i have these questions: 1.
i'm not sure what we mean by epc contract.
"is this referring to the fuel cell document we are working now, or is there to be another layer?"
i know this may depend on whether crra or someone else is doing the balance of the construction activities.
2
"he expects one epc contract, and we had tried to leave room for multiple contracts."
does anyone care?
3
does crra get a full refund of the purchase price if the fuel cells fail the performance tests?
"we have discussed with fce the concept of a proportional reduction if the performance is within 10 percent, then a full reduction as to the failing unit(s) only."
"also, are we planning to mark up the fuel cell contract to recover our fee?"
is our fee at risk for the fuel cells failing to perform?
"thanks, kay"

"""this morning i raised a concern regarding tw's sale of excess fuel at downstream points."
here's the problem:  the tariff requires shippers to tender fuel to us at their receipt points.
"with rare exceptions, those receipt points are not at the cal."
border.
order 636 mandates that pipelines unbundle transportation from storage.
it also requires that pipelines that make gas sales do so at the furthest upstream point on their pipeline.
"that latter requirement means that if a pipe buys gas at point """"x"""", it should resell the gas at point """"x"""" and not haul the gas to point """"y"""" and then sell it there as a delivered (i.e., bundled) product."
my concern this morning was that our receipt of fuel gas in the san juan or permian and shipment of that gas to the cal.
border for sale arguably violates the unbundling requirement (because the cal.
"border sale is a bundled combination of the sale and the transportation of the gas to the downstream location) or the """"furthest upstream point"""" requirement or both."
"susan and my recollection was that when ecs wanted to receive the gallup fuel deliveries at  a point other than permian pool, we made them sign a transport contract to move the gas to where they wanted it."
i haven't confirmed that recollection but i am recalling that we told courtney that we couldn't just move our fuel gas around whereever we wanted it--we needed someone to pay us to transport it.
"irrespective of what we did with ecs, i think the following is the correct way to look at this situation:  we receive fuel at the shippers' receipt points."
"once we receive it, however, it is no longer """"fuel."""
"""  it becomes line pack until it is burned."
"line pack moves around based on a lot of reasons, including shipper imbalances, etc.  it also, obviously, has to move to the compressors where it is burned as fuel."
"it is our job to  manage line pack, and that means we buy line pack at locations where we are short, and sell it at locations where we are long."
if we end up long at the cal.
"border from time to time, we should sell excess line pack to get line pack back to optimal levels."
i wouldn't want to get into a pattern where we are consistently buying line pack in the san juan and permian and selling line pack at the cal.
"border, but  thats not what we are talking about here."
i can't think of anything in the tariff or otherwise that is inconsistent with this interpretation of our authority as operator of the pipeline.
mkm--ok with you?

"hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe $145 - can you verify?"

"tim, my understanding is that partnership fee (the $11."
0m) has been amortized for the last several years and expensed to the industrial groups (mcconville and ondarza).
"as you are aware, i sued them for breach."
the settlement involved the elimination of all existing transactions between ft. james and enron including the wauna and halsey power contracts.
it is my understanding that the benefit of the elimination of those shorts resides in the portland shop.
the elimination of the shorts would not have occurred without the lawsuit on the alliance and the settlement i originated.
it seemed logical to charge the portland office with the remaining un-amortized fee of $1.
8m as a cost of eliminating the shorts for no cost and no future contingent liability.
lets discuss.

the meeting is in room 3259 from 3:00 - 4:00.
experience has taught me that someone much more important may bump us.
this meeting will focus on the cgas storage contract.
what we bill ces for storage injections will be different than what we actually inject.
april is a little more difficult because we will be injecting and withdrawing at the same time.
cgas only bills on the net injections or withdrawal amounts.
the deals in sitara are set up as cpr storage for the injections and the withdrawals.
which brings up the following issues; *   how do we bill ces for injections if we don't enter buy/sales with ces at the storage facility.
kate fraser said there were never any bug buy/sale tickets in sitara for storage.
how did that work?
"mark, i'm counting on you for this one."
* how do we track the storage balance in unify?
"* how are the injection/withdrawal cost capture, especially since cgas will bill on the net injections/withdrawals i'm sure there are more issues that will come up during the meeting."

i took a message from pat brown at avista this morning.
she needed to book one more spa reservation for jean gonnella.
the only time jean can do it is between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the thursday they arrive.
she would like a deep cleansing facial and a french manicure.
"if there isn't time for both, she'd just like the facial."
please call pat and confirm the reservation time when you make it.
her number is 509.495.8123.
thanks!
p.s. i don't want you to think i'm passing the buck.
"i would have taken care of this myself, but mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on tuesday morning."
"good luck, and let me know if you need help."

according to mike this is a q1-01 deal i will double check with the broker and get back to you
how about 4:00?
"jeff, we are thinking about how to finish the mid-market iniative and i need to know if you want breslau."

have we scheduled any gas on the following contracts?
come out with a whole bunch of cool new machines and your stock gets whacked.
what a weird deal that is.
"anyway, when do you think the new imacs will be out in stores?"
i still havent' got around to buying sandra her imac and now she thinks she wants the imac notebook so its a good thing i didn't do this last month.  do you concur that the new ones are worth the wait or should we pick up an old one on mega sale once stores start clearing the old ones out?
df
a likely story.
"by the way, what do you think of having rob or someone obs the coyote springs contract so we can use it as a starting point?"
"karen, jeff is traveling today."
is this the type of release that i should try to get to him before it goes out?
i agree that discussing the numbers in person with aa would be the right way to handle this.
"and, i am looking to brent in managing the current reconciliation process so he can best address the timing of the meeting."
my expectation is that the vast majority of the $49mm variance will be explained and finalized by monday at 11:00 am.
this finalization obviously involves both the gas operations group and gas accounting.
"i will be on vacation on monday while my parents are in town for a visit, but i have carved out time during the day at 11:00 to be in the office for an update on the reconciliation, as it is very important to me. --sally"
please do.

i spoke with rich yesterday.
he said it would be ok to net the storage true up invoice from ernie with the sep invoice.
i mailed the invoice via interoffice to jeff.
there are 6 or 7 deals that ena billed ces for september that should probably be billed to new power.
all of the deals in question are on the central desk.
how does the reconciliation look for jan - june?
rich said it was his understanding that these months look good and the adjustments are minimal.
"hey becky, i haven't heard from you in a while."
"i know, i know, you haven't heard from me either."
i wanted to check in and see how you're doing.
i talked to shannon and she filled me in on how megan's doing.
i want you to know my family and i are praying for you guys.
i know everyone says this but if there is anything i can do i'd love to help out.
i'm going christmas shopping this weekend if you need me to pick up anything for you.
i've got to finish all my shopping and buy something for my mom from my dad.
he had a hip replacement in october and is still hobbling around.
he's actually doing really well considering he had major surgery.
i think he expected to be running marathons by now.
"i'd love to tell you at lot of interesting things going on in my life right now, but unfortunately my life can be summed up in one word right now...work."
i think my other group members are trying to kill me this month.
we have a group of three people and at least two have to be here each day.
"well, i have to work a double shift to cover for someone all but one week this month."
so that's pretty much all i have time to do now.
in fact i'm headed home pretty soon to take a nap before my next shift this afternoon.
that is the one bonus of this split shift day.
let me know how you're doing when you get a chance.

"you may notice that 9911 pma's are $(208,881) or approx 10% to the final p&l.  you will also notice that the detail following the majority of the adjustments is unaccounted for gas."
"at the close of business for the 991 p&l, we saw a gain of approx. $250,000 because of a blowout in ua4."
we thought that it would be prudent to top level this amount and use it to offset the pma's we would take as a result of this ua4 blowout.
"therefore, the net impact of 9911 pma's is $41,119 or 2% of last day p&l. i just wanted to congratulate the team on a great p&l for the month of november. -eric"

a w4 calculates how much federal tax is withheld from your paycheck each pay period.
there are two basic drivers:  number of dependents and filing status.
"the higher the number of dependents, the less is withheld."
married and jointly will also have less withheld than married and seperately.
"there is really no right or wrong answer, only opinion."
"if you want more withheld each pay period so that there is less of a chance of actually owing $ on april 15th, then claim fewer dependents and married and seperately."
"if you don't want the government to get your $ interest free, but are aware that you may owe $ later on (april 15th), then claim a higher number of dependents and married and jointly."
i hope that made sense.

i think the safest and most efficient way to comply with this request is to have keith and ray briefed and ready to answer all ferc's questions without deferring any to other people.
"ray and keith, please talk to gary zahn and make sure you are up to speed on everything ferc has asked for and focused on so far."
"you don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more responsive to what they want to ask you about."
"if you do get stumped, try to defer the question by telling ferc you need to check on a fact or two and can answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview."
"by doing that , you should be able to get them the information they need without having them cross examine a bunch of other people."
"inevitably, if you ask enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers."
"lee, i'd like you to be on the phone call with ray, keith and gary to discuss generally what to be ready for and what ferc has already looked at."

"during june, coral transacted on eol."
"however, they selected a july thru october deal by mistake."
"the marketer immediately called the desk and we agreed to let them out of the deal, which resulted in the creation of a second deal in eol."
"coral is not reporting anything on the deal, since it was unwound."
"but, since eol deals are automatically processed and are firm transactions, we cannot kill the deal on our side, even though they net to zero volume and price."
logistics will be brokering the transactions in mops.
please be sure that coral is not invoiced or paid on these deals.

"""i reviewed the latest draft of aa's management rep. letter and caught a few innaccuracies in the way aa described the deal."
"i attach a revised draft of the letter, with a redline version to highlight for you the changes i think we need to make to keep it accurate."
"first, aa only listed two of the four agreements that comprise the deal."
they apparently forgot that we had created a second sba.
"additionally, at transcanada's request, we put the transaction fee into a separate letter agreement this year."
"you will recall that last year, sempra wanted the transaction fee put right in the sba."
"second, aa's bullet no. 4, as originally drafted, states that northern does not intend to enter into an option to purchase any base gas during the term of the agreement."
that statement is confusing given that article vi.
b of the monthly pack agreement includes an account balance cash out mechanism that is a form of purchase option.
"that cash out mechanism was in kent's bullets describing the deal and has been in every draft of the documents that aa looked at, so i assume they are ok with the mechanism and were just inartful in drafting bullet no. 4."
"my simple fix was to leave aa's language alone but to add an """"except for"""" reference at the beginning of bullet no. 4."
"third, aa's draft of bullet nos. 5 and 6 includes the somewhat ambiguous references to """"other agreements"""" and """"additional agreements"""" respectively."
"since aa's list of the agreements in the intro paragraph was incomplete, these references in bullet nos. 5 and 6 were also innacurate."
"now that i have made the list of agreements in the intro paragraph complete, i've clarified the bullets by adding the """"other than those agreements referenced above"""" language to both bullets."
the couple of other changes in bullet 5 simply clarify the meaning.
"finally, i've modified the signature blocks per conversation with bill to delete mkm and myself."
"i am certainly willing and able to sign this letter, but mkm is not up to speed on the deal and has not reviewed the agreements."
getting her up to speed enough to sign the letter would take some time.
"additionally, bill's thought was that mkm and i are his direct reports anyway, so it doesn't serve much purpose to have the subordinates sign if the top guy has signed."
"please give me a call if you have any questions or want to discuss these matters."""

i wanted to make the following points: 1.
brad will not show up on march 15.
he is still working on his dot-com business and wants to pursue this opportunity.
2
my recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand.
either brad or a stipend refund check should show up on march 15. 3.
i told brad that  a failure to show up on march 15 will not imperil his future employment opportunities with enron.
we just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs.

"on 10/27/00, ferc issued two orders that clarify procedures for requesting long term transmission."
(morgan stanley v. ill. powerand tenaska power v. spp).
"in both cases, the customer requested long term (year or greater) transmission service and in both cases, the atc was insufficient to award the entire request."
"transmission providers, ill. power and spp treated partial service differently."
in these orders ferc holds: a transmission provider (tp) is not required to offer short term service in response to a long term request.
section 19.7 of the pro forma oatt only obligates the tp to tell the customer how much partial long term service could be provided.
examples: -- customer requests 300 mw long term transmission service for one year.  tp replies that it can offer 200 mw for the entire year. -- customer requests 2 year service for 300 mw.  tp replies that it can offer 300 mw for one year. -- customer requests 300 mw for one year.  tp can only provide 300 mw for summer months.  tp is not obligated to provide customer the 3 months service.
"furthermore, an annual request for 300 for some months and 0 mw for others is not a valid long term request."
what customer is then doing is really submitting a short term request for 300 for summer only -- a new short term request must be submitted to obtain the summer transmission.
"while the tp is not required to respond with short term availability in response to a long term request, ferc did footnote to ill. power that it thinks it is a helpful idea for the tp to alert the customer to what atc is available so the customer can submit a short term request if it wishes."
"im big on togetherness, but if you'd rather do separate meetings i'm ok with that also."

"the data includes max temp, max temp deviation from normal (ie if max is 88 and normal max is 86 max temp deviation is +2), min temp, min temp deviation from normal and percent of precipitation."
so far things are looking good.
we are getting a cold front this weekend (hitting texas on monday) and looks like things should be beautiful for next weekend.
i wouldn't be that worried about the rain either - the reason the pop is so high right now is tropical moisture in the gulf of mexico and that will blow through this weekend.
after that the tropics settle down and it is much less likely to get tropical  moisture.
there may be a possible bust in 17.4..

her number is 425-462-3844.
"if you need any other information, please don't hesitate to ask. ]"
thanks for the suggestions for richard.
let me know if you think of other ideas - i need b'day and christmas ideas.
probably the easiest thing to bring for thanksgiving could be a dessert -- or something else that is a favorite of your family.
i know that it is really kind of hard to travel with food -- particularly since you will probably be working on wednesday morning.
"i have made thanksgiving dinner for so many years (one of the few times that i really like to cook), that i will be glad to cover it."
your company will be the very best thing that you can bring.
we are looking forward to having you all here.
(the sleeper sofa for the media room will arrive this friday!
i second that--thanks a lot!!
i just don't want you getting me worked up when there is nothing i can do about it now.

oh and the deal number for the second mike s aquilla deal is 418401

"""this transation is for delivery on anr pipeline company's mainline 7 segment, and as such,  all deliveries shall be made utilizing firm transportation to a designated secondary delivery point (buyer's choice"""") on anr's system."

"maria friend when you receive this, say a prayer."
that's all you have to do.
there is nothing attached.
this is powerful.
"just send this to four people and do not break this, please."
prayer is one of the best free gifts we receive.
there is no cost but a lot of rewards.
let's continue praying for one another.
"father, i ask you to bless my friends reading this right now lord, show them a new revelation of your love and power."
"holy spirit, i ask you to minister to their spirit at this very moment."
"where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy."
"where there is self-doubting, release a renewed confidence in your ability to work through them."
"where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, i ask you to give them understanding, patience, and strength as they learn submission to your leading."
"where there is spiritual stagnation, i ask you to renew them by revealing your nearness, and by drawing them into greater intimacy with you."
"where there is fear, reveal your love, and release to them your courage."
"where there is a sin blocking them, reveal it, and break its hold over my friend's life."
"bless their finances, give them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends to support, and encourage them."
"give each of them discernment to recognize the demonic forces around them, and reveal to them the power they have in you to defeat it."
i ask you to do these things in jesus' name.
"in christian love, your friend in jesus."
passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
passing this on to one not considered a friend is something i know christ would do.

i have asked ena's compensation team within hr to conduct a compensation study for me for all positions from manager level through vice president.
"this analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ena, eim and egm."

the quality and timeliness of your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the analysis that i will receive from todd.
i think that you should each have a vested interest in the success of this project!
todd also plans to resurvey market information for senior specialists and below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of energy operations.
"since we recently took action on compensation levels for key players at the senior specialist level and below, i would not anticipate further adjustments for those levels as a result of todd's review."

"""transwestern held its transport options workshop on august 31."
"commercial and regulatory representatives of bp-amoco, burlington, conoco, coral, dynegy, phillips and reliant attended."
"after a brief overview of the proposed filing, tw opened the floor for questions and comments."
here is a summary of the comments.
marketing affiliate concerns.
bp's regulatory representative expressed concern that tw's marketing affiliates would be able to use options to game the system.
"in bp's example, since tw and ena are both enron companies, ena could purchase an """"out of the money"""" call option essentially cost free, since its affiliate (tw) would have the ability to buy the option back."
"proceeds from ena's ability to then """"move the market"""" through the establishment of the long basis position would go directly to enron's bottom line."
"bp suggested that tw's marketing affiliates be banned from purchasing options, or that the marketing affiliate be required to credit 100% of the option proceeds to other shippers."
"although bp admits that transwestern's prior dealings with ena have not been suspect, bp fears that tw's filing will set a precedent for other pipelines to offer a similar service."
"since tw will be the first pipeline to offer such services, bp wants tw's program to be as restricted as possible."
"dynegy echoed bp's concern regarding possible affiliate abuse, but rather than shelve the program entirely, dynegy reiterated an earlier suggestion that transwestern be required to credit back the difference between the option fee paid by an affiliate and the next highest bidder, if the affiliate's bid exceeds the next highest by a certain percentage."
"tw's response was that while actual abuse of an options program by a marketing affiliate may be a legitimate concern, owing to its unassailable record in this area, tw should be entitled to a presumption that it has complied and will continue to comply with commission policy covering the sale of capacity to marketing affiliates, and was not inclined to voluntarily include any limitations on the options program."
"if bp and others have serious concerns regarding the commission's overall policy on marketing affiliates, those issues should be raised in a separate proceeding that applies to all interstate pipelines."
right of first refusal.
burlington asked whether options would replace the right of first refusal.
tw's  response was that rofr will still be available pursuant to the terms and conditions of our tariff.
negotiated rate.
bp's representative claimed that option contracts will constitute a negotiated rate and that each deal will need to be filed as such.
tw did not respond to this or discuss it further.
"however, tw's position at this point is that since the option fee is part of the transportation rate, transportation deals that include the option amendment will only be considered negotiated rate deals if the total rate including the option fee exceeds the maximum transport rate."
hoarding capacity.
"using the recent large block sale of capacity on el paso as an example, several customers expressed concern that the options program would make it easier for a shipper to hoard capacity."
it was not clear why some of the workshop participants thought that the sale of options would create more opportunity for hoarding capacity than already exists.
"perhaps because the option fee is a lesser cost than the transport rate for the underlying capacity, their perception was that options would simply make hoarding cheaper and easier."
tw acknowledged that the potential for withholding capacity from the market is one reason for ferc's current policy against reserving capacity for shippers.
"although tw did not commit to placing any limits on the either the quantity of capacity or options for capacity that any one shipper may own, it is possible that ferc may require tw to do so in a final order."
"our plan is to meet with pg&e and socalgas in california the week of september 11 to go over details of the program, and to finalize the ferc filing by mid-september."""

"""keith, the article i mentioned."
vince *********************************************** rashed by tax selling but are there bargains among the discards?
by michael santoli here it is more than six months since even the most intransigent last-minute filers wrote checks to the irs to render to the government its due for their financial good fortune in 1999.
"by rights, this should be a season relatively free of concerns about taxes, notwithstanding the presidential candidates' parrying over whose tax-cut math features more fuzz."
"and yet, for anyone with a dollar in the stock market (which in recent weeks has likely been reduced to loose change), the looming demands of this year's levies on capital gains have helped to make this month yet another taxing october for investors."
the jump-and-stumble course the major stock indexes have taken this year is being blamed for a particularly intense effort among mutual-fund managers and other big investors to sell their losers.
the steep ramp-up in stocks that persisted from the fall of 1999 through the first quarter of this year -- led by the technology must-haves -- left funds with ripe profit-taking opportunities when the nasdaq surge flagged in april.
this sell-high activity generated heavy capital gains in many portfolios -- tax liabilities that managers have been rushing to offset with realized losses by selling stocks that have cratered.
the fact that so many funds are enduring a flat-to-down year in this difficult market has only added to the urgency.
investors aren't fond of getting stuck with taxable distributions in even the most flush years of a bull market.
"so managers are now trading in fear of how their shareholders will react to funds' kicking off gains distributions in a year when the value of their holdings fails to appreciate or, worse, falls outright."
"with the majority of funds operating on an october 31 fiscal year end, and given a trend toward letting investors know their estimated tax hit well before year's end, much of this selling has been concentrated in a brief period of weeks."
"one fund executive attending a fidelity mutual-fund conference last week reported that, oddly, some managers have resolved to be contrary and """"overdo it"""" in selling even their winners."
"the theory, he reports, is that if they're going to have a capital-gains distribution anyway, the most skittish shareholders will sell the fund to avoid the payout and its tax liability, whether it's, say, either 10% or 12% of net asset value."
"so the idea is to take profits and """"reload"""" for the benefit of those investors who will stick around."
"now, with the nasdaq off 22.7% since labor day and 8% so far in october, much talk is bubbling about suggesting that the assault is ending."
this line of reasoning counsels that it's time to peek out of the foxhole and survey the wreckage for some badly damaged stocks to pick up in expectation of a late-year rally.
not so fast.
"while it's true that in past years, these hard-hit tax-selling victims tend to recover in the early part of november, the move often proves fleeting."
"like a ball being held under water, these stocks jump when the downward pressure is released, but that doesn't mean they escape gravity's pull for long."
"soon enough, they're hit by a secondary wave of selling by investors who tidy up their tax situation closer to the end of the year."
the quantitative equity research team at lehman brothers has studied recent market history in search of patterns in tax-driven selling.
"in the process, the analysts came up with a list of 131 stocks that look vulnerable to persistent weakness through most of the fourth quarter."
"the study scanned the russell 3000 index -- basically the 3,000 largest u.s. stocks -- for those that had fallen at least 40% this year through september, and had lost at least 10% in the prior six months."
they also plucked only those stocks that had seen rising trading volume over that period.
the idea was to find only those names that seem to be in the throes of a selling crescendo.
"in 1997, there were just eight such stocks."
"in 1998, there were 202 and last year 101, on a par with this year's tired crop."
"murali ramaswami of lehman says, """"there's both a tax-loss story and a momentum story."
"losers continue to be losers."""
""" at least through the fourth quarter they do."
the negative momentum of these stocks tends to gather speed from the first week of november to christmas.
"in this period, from 1997 through last year, the losers portfolio dropped an average of 20% more than did the russell 3000 index."
"bottom-fishers, beware."
"the resulting list, which lehman billed to its institutional clients as a menu for hungry short-sellers, features numerous stocks caught in the major downside themes of the year."
"name a major telecom-services provider and the odds are good it's in this bunch, the result of a stampede away from the group. big retailers also dot the down-on-their-luck roster, as the slowing economy has ravaged shares of circuit city, dillards, saks and others."
"and of course there are plenty of dot.com names experiencing the ugly side of a mania undone, in a reversal that has made some mere flyspecks on the market's windshield."
witness barnesandnoble.com and razorfish.
"an intrepid prospector surveying this list in a quest for next year's comeback stock of the year will encounter no shortage of companies that appear, for the moment, broken and in need of an inspired strategic revamping, some slick investor-relations work and plenty of luck."
"former blue chips such as lucent technologies, bausch & lomb and dial seem to fall into that club, where for investors a love of dirt-cheap stocks and a strong backbone is the price of admission."
"dupont, which recently ratcheted down its 2001 growth forecast and is beset by high raw-materials costs, is arguably apt to remain in the investors' time-out chair for a while as well."
that its shares failed to sell off after a limp earnings report last week is perhaps the most hopeful sign one can seize on with regard to the chemicals giant.
"still, for the investor patient enough to endure what could be a stormy november and december, a few sizable companies with temporary problems but solid long-term growth stories are attracting some fund managers looking to buy."
"as detailed in barron's last week (""""retailers on sale,"""" october 23), there is reason to expect better performance from selected retail chains."
"federated department stores, the parent of macy's and bloomingdale's, merits attention both for its buoyant same-store sales growth in a retail headwind and for its repair of the addled fingerhut catalogue division, which suffered a spike in delinquencies."
"the shares are off their trough levels in the low 20s, but a recent quote of 28 still seems a better-than-fair price for a company that some pros believe could earn more than $5 a share next year."
the advertising business this year is being given the cold shoulder by investors after a torrid love affair through 1999.
"fearing that the dot.com washout and resultant cash drought would wither the bottom line of ad firms, investors abandoned interpublic, the third-largest owner of ad agencies after wpp and omnicom."
"but mark greenberg, manager of the invesco leisure fund, saw a chance to pick up a """"good, solid company"""" inexpensively when interpublic hit the low 30s."
"now at 39, interpublic is still fetching just 22 times forecast 2001 earnings, which are expected to grow 15%, faster than profits for the overall market. """
"""i bought some early this year and added to it just recently."
"the bad news is probably priced into the stock, and then some,"""" he says."
"madison avenue markdown interpublic, parent of mccann erickson, among other firms, has always suffered a bit in comparison with omnicom, a market darling considered the class operator in the industry."
"but interpublic now trades at a discounted valuation, and is briskly expanding its direct-marketing and public-relations business, which are growing faster than the traditional madison avenue game."
add in the fact that only a sliver of its business comes from dot.
"coms and that half its revenues are collected overseas, and interpublic appears well insulated from crippling economic forces."
"in a more prosaic corner of the ad business sits valassis communications, a big coupon distributor, which produces the colorful inserts that fall out of your sunday paper."
"a well-loved growth stock that pleased many a small and mid-cap fund manager in 1999, valassis this year ran into a nettlesome combination of higher paper prices and stiffer price competition in one of its insert categories."
"investors bailed out in droves, halving the stock from a high above 44 to just north of 20."
"now at 25, the shares are """"absurdly cheap,"""" says greenberg, who also owns valassis."
"another fund manager points out that the company has taken control of its troubles, with hedged paper prices and a move to cut supply in products where pricing declined."
"even with its growth forecast revised downward, valassis is still expected to increase profits at a 10%-15% long-term rate, and earnings next year should rise close to 12%, to $2.50 a share."
that leaves the stock at a mere 10 times next year's profits.
"and it's worth noting that in times of slower economic growth, coupons are among the things that companies continue to offer to bargain-hunters."
"with a new wave of tax selling due to bear down on haggard stocks any week now, it might feel as if the typical first-quarter rebound in the year's losers that's been documented by lehman brothers is hopelessly distant."
"if you're tempted nonetheless to plunge ahead and buy a beaten-down mutual fund, check first to see if it will be among those making a capital-gains distribution later this year."
"in that case, you'll be on the hook for the tax even though you didn't participate in the gain."
"(you can take the plunge without worrying about payouts if you're buying the fund for a tax-deferred account such as a 401(k) or an ira.) but at least in selected stocks, it seems the machinations of tax-fearing investors have created the stock market equivalent of a 25%-off sale, and you don't need to redeem a manufacturer's coupon to take advantage."""
"guys, wes is going to come talk to you about booking more value in mariner in order to meet global finance and ena targets."
i want a view from you guys of what is the prudent carry value for mariner assuming current gas prices and the reserve increases assumed to coming.
keep in mind what would be a reasonble sale value for the asset mid-next year as per our plan.

"great--steve, what's your phone no. ?"
we will change it so that they can't buy any equipment without further written authorization from enron.
"rose, i suggest putting [brackets] around commercial operation as the date we can assign without consent."
"as of now commercial operation is not a defined term (i hope it will become a defined term), so we may want to agree to a different milestone."
"thanks, kay"
carol: thank you for the prompt.
the only times stan has available for this conference call would be at 8:00am tomorrow morning or 8:

based on our discussion and after further consideration i feel that it would be an excellent fit for both the real time group and myself.
"with my prior and current work experience and knowledge of the enpower system,    i am confident that i will be a valuable asset to your team."
i look forward to the opportunity and eagerly await your positive response.
please feel free to contact me with any questions or concerns you may have.

go into some detail and speak to a couple of specific opportunities.
it may also be interesting for you to give an initial cut on the economics of coal generation (including emissions control) given current power and gas markets and a quick view of the development process.
how should we participate in this market?
gasification technology?
"jeff, in your talk, can you focus on the emerging distributed generation sector ie) the technologies, the users, the vc's, etc.  specifically, how will these technologies change our business model and the overall power business model?"
how are we positioning ourselves in this market?
what is the pi strategy with this regard?
"dorie hitchcock and tammy sheppard can do a lot of the heavy lifting; however, we need a first cut by december 8th."

i think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.
i talked to patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users perspective.
"my thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over different scenarios within each region, such as opal plant, socal, etc.  we can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with."
"i also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and i did not want to forget them."
1
"when we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred."
2
should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes at a late time?
we could do the rest over the phone.
3
"on edi pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30."
i thought these were just questions we might want to think about.
i'm sure there are a lot of others.
thanks.

"http://www.cme.com/fe50 ______________________________________________________________________ herb on thestreet: taking a closer look at the honey well by herb greenberg senior columnist 9/11/00 6:30 am et an item in one of last week's hotlines questioned whether a key """"tell"""" toward a possible preannouncement from honeywell (hon:nyse) was an earnings warning from invensys, a british controls and automation company."
"invensys is a honeywell competitor, and honeywell fans had been looking at the company's controls group for signs of strength this quarter."
"got a bunch of angry email, in response, telling me i must be a kook (or actually, something much worse ) because just a few weeks ago honeywell said it was comfortable with earnings estimates of 76 cents per share, which would be a pleasant 10% gain."
"true, but this is, after all, the same honeywell that in june gave expectations of one thing for second-quarter revenues, only to amend that a few weeks later with a lower number."
"and this is, after all, the same honeywell that several quarters ago said it would take no more big charges, and then turned around and took a whole bunch of new charges."
will the same thing happen this time round?
"hard to say, and as of friday all a honeywell spokesman would say to me was: """"we're sticking with our guidance."""
""" on earnings, that is."
"interestingly (and subtly) honeywell didn't say anything about revenues in its recent update, and the spokesman said there will be no revenue guidance now, either."
"stung once, too smart to be stung twice, i guess."
"but that also highlights that honeywell has entered the quarter with negative revenue momentum, which is not what wall street wants to see."
earnings can meet estimates lots of different ways (an item here back in march showed how half of honeywell's 20% earnings gain came from pension income) but revenue represents business in the raw.
"so, why worry now?"
"according to one longtime honeywell watcher, who prefers to go incognito (so he can protect his relationship with the company, in which he still holds a small stake), events that could further effect this quarter's earnings and revenues include the sharp rise in oil prices -- the same rise in oil prices that last week helped clobber dupont (dd:nyse), which warned of lower earnings (thanks, in part, to oil)."
honeywell also disclosed that problems with brakes it makes for buses will shave 2 cents per share off earnings.
"the warning came after the earnings reassurance a couple of weeks ago, but was included in the recent forecast."
"it's unclear, however, how the problems will affect brake sales (and therefore revenues), going forward."
"oh, and honeywell is laying off 5% of its workforce."
"(a supposed growth company firing people?!) then there are more charges, lots of charges -- but the 76 cent per share number excludes them."
"what's more, analysts are just starting to take a close look at the company now that they're back from summer vacation."
"at least one analyst who has tried to get some sign of how things are going was told the company hasn't seen the august numbers yet, which means there still could be reasons for concern."
"all of that said, honeywell has been doing loads to improve itself, but our longtime honeywell watcher, who is looking for the right time to hop back in, doesn't think there'll be signs of a solid rebound until next summer."
at the earliest.
"short positions o from reader john lee: """"how's this for an inflation indicator?"
"down here in our cafeteria today we were confronted by a sign that indicated the cafeteria was raising prices """"to cover rising food and labor costs..."""" but inflation is nearly nonexistent, right?"
"right (he said, sarcastically)."
"wouldn't be surprised to see a few fast-food chains that missed earnings last quarter, because of rising costs, bite the bullet and raise prices, too."
(a dime or a quarter isn't going to drive customers away; but a dime here at one place and a quarter there at another would certainly lead to higher prices across the board.
or so you'd think!) o stupid poll?!
": that's what some folks thought of friday's poll which asked whether you should pay more attention to a company, friendly analysts or unfriendly analysts."
"(unfriendly won by a landslide.) several readers, however, wish i'd had a fourth alternative: all of the above."
"says reader bridget magnus: """"i think that if a person is going to make a realistic, informed decision about a company it is a good idea to listen to all three of those sources (the company, friendly analysts, and unfriendly analysts)."
"putting them together will give a potential investor a much clearer picture of what is (or isn't) going on."""
""" great point!"

"george wrote the textbook on how to be a hard-working, daily, news-oriented columnist."
"you could see just how hard he worked when he walked through the office at the end of every day, looking exhausted, as he handed the finished copy into his editor."

i would expect that sarah tomalty will attend anyway to make sure we make good on our promise.
deal # q52317 - the counterparty is nylon de mexico and the contact is alberto diosdado.
the originator on the deal is agustin perez.
howard can you remove me from this distribution list - my life is a little complicated.
"my phone's not working(no signal in the woods), but i'll call you when i go to ruston tomorrow afternoon."
fyi.
can you make a call tomorrow at 100?
have you decided?
i am not trying to rush you - but i am leaving early today for austin - so i need to set my lineup before i leave!
"we will be meeting with gil muhl, janet dietrich and others to discuss customer coverage, deal flow, strategic deals/customers etc.  i think the meeting is going to held offsite  at either the doubletree or hyatt."
i know that you are disappointed about his move.
"rick:  sorry, i should have sent this to you several days ago."
is the level of detail correct on these goals as you look to assimilate these with others?
"i have stated the goals, but not the action plan to achieve the goals."
i am working on those in some detail right now.   --sally goals for 2000 global risk management operations i.  build/enhance operational and controls infrastructure to support: a.  merchant activities japan southern cone continental europe other regions as identified b.  emerging businesses/products enron broadband services credit trading other products as identified c.  joint ventures ii.
"strengthen mid and back office talent and controls for global risk management operations a.  establish common operational standards,with effective exception reporting b.   strengthen and support the controls mindset in key operational personnel c.  develop a plan to identify, develop and provide rotational opportunities to key operations employees d.  continue to coordinate with it to develop mid and back office systems that allow for timely and accurate compilation of data across  systems for risk and business reporting"
supposedly my phone is going to be switched over the weekend so i should be back in the world of reachable individuals next week.
i'm glad you appreciated my observation rather than taking offence.
"i was afraid after two weeks of silence i may have pissed you off somehow, in which case that last email would have probably been the final nail in the coffin."
as far as the new job goes it is looking very promising.
"turns out my trader went to college with my brother-in-law, sister, and brother so we have too many mutual connections for him to be mean or rude to me."
even without the connections he seems like a pretty cool guy and is very supportive of my learning all i can about his book.
"hopefully, after i get the daily routine down he'll let me sit with him during the down times and watch him work."
"you should definitely try and see the film saturday and even if you can't pull yourself out of bed you should rent it, i really think you would enjoy/be inspired by it (at least i am every time i watch it)."
i hope things are well with you although i am sensing some disenchantment.
if that is the case i can give you a few tips on how to overcome and once again appreciate your current position in life.
believe me over the last two months i have had ample opportunity to do just that.
just let me know if i can return the favour you once did for me.
have fun at y'alls happy hour tonight.

i heard through the grapevine you went the other weekend.

"danny clark, who used to work in deal clearing & documentation for ect a couple of years ago, is in ees as far as i know."

"on the effective termination date of the oba, terminate the interconnect agreement by giving 30 days notice to burlington."
"the 12/31/92 interconnect point operating agreement, paragraph 6, provides that either party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary term."
this is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire until 12/31/02.
"however, the paragraph also provides that the agreement """"may be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in the event the oba between the parties is terminated."""

i forwarded your request to luchas johnson.
he runs the g-daily-est book.
dg    3-9573<br>enron north america corp.
in his letter he also proposed monthly fees for regulatory services ($5000/mo.) and market development services (including socal oir related services -- $3000/mo.).
this e-mail addresses the project development fee structure only.
"the recently expired market development agreement with igs provided for a one-time retainer of $15,000 and a monthly retainer of $5000, plus expenses, and an incentive fee structure for any agreement between transwestern and third party """"identified by igs under this agreement."""
"""  as you know, the """"identified by"""" language presented us with some ambiguity in the case of the southern energy gallup expansion contract, in which both igs and the tw commercial group worked on the deal."
"fortunately, the ambiguity worked to transwestern's advantage in that case, but my understanding is that in ongoing dealings with igs both parties would prefer more specificity in any future consulting agreement."
mark's proposal represents a step in the right direction because it provides for payment on a per-project basis.
"this immediately eliminates the """"identified by"""" problem because we won't be obligated to pay him unless and until he identifies a project we're interested in him working on."
i propose that we define some general terms and conditions in an enabling agreement.
"if mark brings us a project we want to pursue, we will pay him according to these terms (and any other terms and conditions tailored to the specific project, as needed)."
"for each project, we would simply enter into a short letter agreement referencing the enabling agreement."
i've outlined the agreement below as a starting point for discussion.
the numbers are mark's; we'll have to discuss whether they are appropriate.
"i've omitted any payment for a letter of intent because since they are nonbinding, letters of intent are of little value to transwestern."
call me after you've reviewed this and let's discuss how you want to proceed.
"from time to time during the term of the enabling agreement, igs may present brief, preliminary project proposals to transwestern."
"if transwestern desires igs's assistance in developing a particular project, it will so notify igs in writing and shall execute an agreement with igs adopting the following terms and conditions: 1."
retainer for project development:  $1000/month plus expenses.
"project development shall include but not be limited to:  research, due diligence, market analysis, negotiation with counterparties (to the extent specifically authorized by transwestern), reporting to marketing representatives of transwestern as requested by transwestern, and preparing a detailed written proposal."
transwestern and igs may agree in writing to other project-specific requirements.
transwestern shall continue to pay the retainer each month until a definitive agreement is signed with the counterparty or transwestern notifies igs in writing that it has decided to terminate the project.
2
"if transwestern accepts the project described in igs's written proposal (or with modifications after reviewing the written proposal), it shall pay igs a fee of [the lesser of] $5000 [or ___% of the net present value of the project]."
"""""accepting the project"""" means that the project meets transwestern's financial, regulatory and other criteria and the transwestern commercial group has obtained the necessary officer approval to pursue the project to completion."
accepting the project and paying igs pursuant to this paragraph in no way obligates transwestern to pursue the project to completion.
3
"if transwestern signs a definitive agreement with a counterparty for the project, it shall pay igs $10,000."
"additionally, the parties may negotiate an additional incentive fee (to be agreed upon and documented at the outset of the project)."
"(i will also include provisions on termination, confidentiality, etc.)."

i just had to rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!
lavo seemed happy with everything this morning.

"and no i didn't get much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault."
even after i went to bed i just kept waking up.
it was one of those nights where you wake up and look at the clock at least once every hour.
i feel a little dazed but other than that i'm okay.
and no i'm not glad to be back at work.

when's the big ski trip?
hey kiddo.
i didn't get in until last night.
my weekend went allright.
most of it was filled with family stuff.
saturday night i just hung out with my dad and watched the beavs game on tv.
i did go out to hollywood with some friends on sunday night however.
it was a friend of mines birthday so we went over to his house and then to this club in hollywood.
"it  was  a good time however, pretty mellow."
i went with my friends chrissy and allison and they both had to work on monday so we left at around midnight.
"it was okay with me however, as i really wasnt that into partying anyway."
"oh yeah, i got that job."
"i think i start tommorow night which means i will be working this weekend which really sucks as there is a beavs game, but i am really looking forward to this new position."
how did your weekend go?

i certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update gcp.
i assume that you have talked with both mary solmonson and james scribner about this process to understand the details.
they are the logical experts for that discussion.
"your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, i would suggest spending time with james and mary so that you and they are appropriately informed."
absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to gcp.
"i believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from entelligence into gcp."
james and mary (i refer to both because james has only recently assumed mary's duties within global databases) can best discuss how this process works.
"if you are aware of specific concerns around this, i know that james and mary will want to hear that from you."
"as is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do."
your input will help james in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have.
i recognize the challenge that credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today.
"with your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible."
"hey, what's up?"
are you having a good week?
"ina, i scheduled a meeting with jean mrha tomorrow at 3:30"
i think we are pretty well covered on this issue--thanks for checking!
congratulations!
that's fantastic.

"""to all of you who are without the luxury of a dial tone this morning: qwest communications is working on the malfunctioning phone circuit."
we don't know when the service will be reinstated; but in the meantime you can reflect on what life was like before the darn thing was invented.
"bell, alexander graham b. , march 3, 1847, edinburgh d. aug. 2, 1922, beinn bhreagh, cape breton island, nova scotia, can. scottish-born american audiologist best known as the inventor of the telephone (1876)."
"for two generations his family had been recognized as leading authorities in elocution and speech correction, with alexander melville bell's standard elocutionist passing through nearly 200 editions in english."
young bell and his two brothers were trained to continue the family profession.
his early achievements on behalf of the deaf and his invention of the telephone before his 30th birthday bear testimony to the thoroughness of his training.
"alexander (""""graham"""" was not added until he was 11) was the second of the three sons of alexander melville bell and eliza grace symonds bell."
"apart from one year at a private school, two years at edinburgh's royal high school (from which he was graduated at 14), and attendance at a few lectures at edinburgh university and at university college in london, bell was largely family trained and self-taught."
"his first professional post was at mr. skinner's school in elgin, county moray, where he instructed the children in both music and elocution."
"in 1864 he became a resident master in elgin's weston house academy, where he conducted his first studies in sound."
"appropriately, bell had begun professionally as he would continue through life--as a teacher-scientist."
in 1868 he became his father's assistant in london and assumed full charge while the senior bell lectured in america.
"the shock of the sudden death of his older brother from tuberculosis, which had also struck down his younger brother, and the strain of his professional duties soon took their toll on young bell."
"concern for their only surviving son prompted the family's move to canada in august 1870, where, after settling near brantford, ont., bell's health rapidly improved."
"in 1871 bell spent several weeks in boston, lecturing and demonstrating the system of his father's visible speech, published in 1866, as a means of teaching speech to the deaf."
"each phonetic symbol indicated a definite position of the organs of speech such as lips, tongue, and soft palate and could be used by the deaf to imitate the sounds of speech in the usual way."
"young a. graham bell, as he now preferred to be known, showed, using his father's system, that speech could be taught to the deaf."
his astounding results soon led to further invitations to lecture.
even while vacationing at his parents' home bell continued his experiments with sound.
"in 1872 he opened his own school in boston for training teachers of the deaf, edited his pamphlet visible speech pioneer, and continued to study and tutor; in 1873 he became professor of vocal physiology at boston university."
"never adept with his hands, bell had the good fortune to discover and inspire thomas watson, a young repair mechanic and model maker, who assisted him enthusiastically in devising an apparatus for transmitting sound by electricity."
their long nightly sessions began to produce tangible results.
"the fathers of george sanders and mabel hubbard, two deaf students whom he helped, were sufficiently impressed with the young teacher to assist him financially in his scientific pursuits."
"nevertheless, during normal working hours bell and watson were still obliged to fulfill a busy schedule of professional demands."
it is scarcely surprising that bell's health again suffered.
"on april 6, 1875, he was granted the patent for his multiple telegraph; but after another exhausting six months of long nightly sessions in the workshop, while maintaining his daily professional schedule, bell had to return to his parents' home in canada to recuperate."
in september 1875 he began to write the specifications for the telephone.
"on march 7, 1876, the united states patent office granted to bell patent number 174,465 covering """"the method of, and apparatus for, transmitting vocal or other sounds telegraphically . . . by causing electrical undulations, similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds."""
""" within a year followed the commercial application and, a few months later, the first of hundreds of legal suits."
"ironically, the telephone--until then all too often regarded as a joke and its creator-prophet as, at best, an eccentric--was the subject of the most involved patent litigation in history."
the two most celebrated of the early actions were the dowd and drawbaugh cases wherein the fledgling bell telephone company successfully challenged two subsidiaries of the giant western union telegraph company for patent infringement.
"the charges and accusations were especially painful to bell's scottish integrity, but the outcome of all the litigation, which persisted throughout the life of his patents, was that bell's claims were upheld as the first to conceive and apply the undulatory current."
"in 1877 bell married mabel hubbard, 10 years his junior."
"the bell story does not end with the invention of the telephone; indeed, in many ways it was a beginning."
"a resident of washington, d.c., bell continued his experiments in communication, which culminated in the invention of the photophone--transmission of sound on a beam of light; in medical research; and in techniques for teaching speech to the deaf."
"in 1880 france honoured bell with the volta prize; and the 50,000 francs (roughly equivalent to u.s. $10,000) financed the volta laboratory, where, in association with charles sumner tainter and his cousin, chichester a. bell, bell invented the graphophone."
"employing an engraving stylus, controllable speeds, and wax cylinders and disks, the graphophone presented a practical approach to sound recording."
bell's share of the royalties financed the volta bureau and the american association to promote the teaching of speech to the deaf (since 1956 the alexander graham bell association for the deaf ).
"may 8, 1893, was one of bell's happiest days; his 13-year-old prodigy, helen keller, participated in the ground-breaking ceremonies for the new volta bureau building--today an international information centre relating to the oral education of the deaf."
in 1885 bell acquired land on cape breton island in nova scotia.
"there, in surroundings reminiscent of his early years in scotland, he established a summer home, beinn bhreagh, complete with research laboratories."
in 1898 bell succeeded his father-in-law as president of the national geographic society.
"convinced that geography could be taught through pictures, he sought to promote an understanding of life in distant lands in an age when travel was limited to a privileged few."
"again he found the proper hands, gilbert grosvenor, his future son-in-law, who transformed a modest pamphlet into a unique educational journal reaching millions throughout the world."
"as interest in the possibility of flight increased after the turn of the century, he experimented with giant man-carrying kites."
"characteristically, bell again found a group of four willing young enthusiasts to execute his theories."
"always an inspiration, mabel hubbard bell, wishing to maintain the stimulating influence of the group, soon founded the aerial experiment association, the first research organization established and endowed by a woman."
deafness was no handicap to the wife of professor bell.
"at beinn bhreagh, bell entered new subjects of investigation, such as sonar detection, solar distillation, the tetrahedron as a structural unit, and hydrofoil craft, one of which weighed more than 10,000 pounds and attained a speed record of 70 miles per hour in 1919."
"apart from his lifelong association with the cause of the deaf, bell never lingered on one project."
his research interests centred on basic principles rather than on refinements.
"the most cursory examination of his many notebooks shows marginal memos and jottings, often totally unrelated to the subject at hand--reminders of questions and ideas he wanted to investigate."
it was impossible for him to carry each of his creative ideas through to a practical end.
"many of his conceptions are only today seeing fruition; indeed, some undoubtedly have yet to be developed."
the range of his inventive genius is represented only in part by the 18 patents granted in his name alone and the 12 he shared with his collaborators.
"these included 14 for the telephone and telegraph, 4 for the photophone, 1 for the phonograph, 5 for aerial vehicles, 4 for hydroairplanes, and 2 for a selenium cell."
until a few days before his death bell continued to make entries in his journal.
"during his last dictation he was reassured with """"don't hurry,"""" to which he replied, """"i have to."""
""""""
that is fine

"the goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve greater efficiency and consistency across the organization."
"to this end, a legal policy group will be formed for ews legal, which will include lance schuler, enron americas; mark evans, enron europe; mark taylor, enron net works; alan aronowitz, enron global markets; julia murray, enron industrial markets; and bruce lundstrom, enron global assets."
the organization chart for the ews legal department is attached.
more comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

"""maybe we should add another section to mr. scott's worksheet for """"third party""""  buy's and sells (like the aquilla deal #452810) and the deal we did on the 7th where ena bought the gas back from new power."
"not a big deal for october, but we will probably start doing our maunal billing process again for the winter months."
"i could see you guys buying incremental third party gas that we may need to schedule, especially during high pipeline constraints."
example:  you might buy gas from sempra at eagle into cgas and we use your transport to get it to a citygate.
ena would buy it from new power at eagel and sell it back to new power at the citygate.
we should let you know what the deal ticket number is via email or phone call and scott could put it on the worksheet.
"so if we had this tab for october, it would just have 2 deals on it so far."

stan
"""stuck on the phone so i thought i'd email you."
"stan has asked mike moran if tw has any potential exposure on the high value transport deals under """"anti gouging"""" statutes or common law."
"you know, the laws that say you can't charge $100 per sheet of plywood during a hurricane or $50 for a bucket of water during a drought."
i think we need to research two things: 1.
are there any such laws applicable to our business?
(cal.
state law would probably be the best place to start) 2.
could the political/regulatory fight in cal about power and gas prices ever expand all the way to our transport pricing?
"i.e., if the cpuc whacks the power sellers for taking unfair advantage of their monopoly power, its not a big leap for the cpuc or ferc or even u.s. congress to whack gas sellers for jacking prices up to $14/mmbtu, as happened on friday."
"if that happens, its just another small jump to whack us for charging $1 for transport, or so the logic goes."
i'd like to hear preliminary views by 8:30 monday am so i can talk to mike before stan's staff meeting (no written memo necessary).
based on that prelim.
"research, we can decide what else need s to be done."
"thanks df"""

looks ok to me.
"kevin, i am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the increased mw's given well known industry issues with the 501f technology."
"further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower than 90 degrees at site."
likely the buyer will run any spread option value or multiple value based on 90 degree output.
i may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the mw's at any time but we would likely run into warranty issues with westinghouse.
"given that the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really get."
would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.
the thought process on the eecc side is for them to find overhead and cost savings to fund their fee ($9.
0m) rather than further increase to the capital cost of the facilities.
"as well, given current accounting language, any fee we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized so i would like to find ways for this to be self financing."
my knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and adjust tactics with eecc as necessary.

this issue would impact section 20.1(a).

article 20 regarding indemnification is included in attachment 8.
"as we discussed, west lb has some concerns regarding including language in article 20 which geii requested by which west lb would indemnify geii for enron's acts (in its capacity as agent)."
west lb has suggested they would be willing to undertake this obligation if they are reimbursed by enron through the acquisition and development agreement.
"today, for the first time, west lb indicated that they may require a cap on this liability for agent's acts in the purchase agreement."
geii has requested that west lb undertake this obligation and enron has agreed to pursue it with west lb.
"in light of this, the language which would establish west lb's indemnity obligation for the agent's acts is not included in the current draft of attachment 8."

christine and i seem to have gotten phillips interested in a right to terminate if tw's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.
"they said they would mull it over, at least."
but what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would get the contract rate no matter what.
"since this would make it a negotiated rate deal from day 1, i feel like i need to get your buy-in before we agree to it."
steve has already told me it is ok with him.
please advise.

i do not understand what is holding up completing this transaction other than a complete re-trade on the original transaction.

"in fact, we were originally solicited by enron wind to help build the merchant wind market and we had to coax enron wind to do this transaction with ena versus txu."

"""as to your question about what's going on in california, i've done some reading and here are my thoughts."
"the nov. 1 ferc order in docket no. el00-95-000, in which the commission ordered a $150/mwh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the commission's authority under section 206 of the federal power act."
"specifically, the fpa provides that if the commission finds that """"any rate, charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule, regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or classification"""" is unjust or unreasonable, the commission shall determine the just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice, or contract that should be in effect."
"the commission recognized that certain areas of the flawed california market are not within its jurisdiction, but """"fixed"""" the areas within its jurisdiction."
"apparently the california governor agrees with me that the commission's jurisdiction in the area of wholesale electricity prices is questionable... in any event, if the commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its authority to do so would be much clearer."
"the natural gas act expressly authorizes ferc to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just and reasonable.  """
"""just and reasonable"""" has been interpreted in many different contexts and the commission has significant discretion over what it means."
"as we all know too well, the commission sometimes acts unpredictably."
"however, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3 above-max-rate contracts to motivate the ferc to act to declare a negotiated rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and unreasonable."
the california proceeding was initiated after entire communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their electricity bills.
the prices for electricity in california were outrageous across the board and affected everyone in the state.
"by contrast, tw's transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not widespread enough for anyone to notice."
"it is far from being a consumer issue, and besides, the elections are over."
"however, as you and i have already discussed, we must be wary of parties like dynegy that do notice just about everything and who might try to draw it to ferc's attention."
we do need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving california are doing the same types of deals.
"kathy, why don't you and i discuss a system of monitoring the contract information postings of el paso, kern, pgt/nw."
"drew, obviously i've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a more in-depth report."""
"bob, please activate some new henry hub gas daily swaps that i created this morning."

"rob, i got your name from doug leach."
he  thought that you would be the person to talk to about this.
i got a call last night from rudolph maldonado.
(the operator forwarded him our way.)  he stated that he has some natural gas to sell in saudi arabia.
his number is 562-866-1755.
could you give him a call and check this out?
i told him that i would find someone that he could discuss this with.
i can be reached at 3-6905 if you have any questions.

"""given the numbers we got from mark baldwin, is this where we are?"
: 1.
the overall economics of the pipeline project have to be supported almost entirely by the new power plant.
"at most, we could assume maybe 5,000-10,000/day of gas load from industrials near the airport, and another x,000 from kirtland's gas load."
this assumed load will ramp up over several years (or longer depending on how long these folks existing contracts are) and not be available immediately.
2
we know the bogey for pricing the electric contract for doe.
"its probably $0.042/kwh, less 15-20% to make it attractive, or maybe $0.056, less 15-20%."
"either way, a low rate."
3
"we now know the best case scenario for cost on the pipeline--about $17 mm in the 16"""" configuration, without the isleta lateral or the lateral over to the power plant."
maybe about $20mm total?
4
"we don't have absolutely reliable info on electric transmission constraints from the proposed plant to palo verde, so i'd suggest that for now we just assume that we would be unconstrained on power sales at palo verde."
are there alternative liquid markets available that might have better pricing?
ercot?  pub.
serv.
colorado?
5
"i'm not entirely sure how you guys are looking at the overall economics, but to my non-business guy mind, the following scenarios (or something similar) stick out as the key benchmarks that will decide whether the project makes sense: a.  worst case: assume we build a 75 mw power plant (i.e., assume no extra power to sell in spot market) and assume we get the kirtland gas load but no additional gas load from the customers baldwin talked to ."
if the rate for the gas line is the minimum rate that enron could live with (based on our internal hurdle rates) can we hit the doe target power price and have any $$$ left over?
i suspect this scenario is upside down.
should we look at two alternative configurations for the power plant--combined cycle and simple cycle?
b.  mid case: assume we size the power plant at 150mw (or some similar size based on a turbine configuration that makes sense) and that we sell the surplus power at palo verde prices less albequerque-palo verde transmission costs.
"again, assume no incremental gas load except kirtland."
"if the gas pipeline rate is set at the minimum rate enron can live with, does the power plant make enough $$$ to make the project work?"
"c.  wildly optimistic case: same as mid-case, except add baldwin's gas load and start ramping in some estimated amount of additional gas load when nm gas restructuring kicks in in 2003 (did i get the year right?)."
"also, start ramping in some estimated amount of high priced retail power sales to back out the palo verde spot sales at whatever year nm retail electric restructuring is expected to kick in."
"(also 2003, i think)."
"with optimistic assumptions like this, does it make sense?"
"tino suggested a meeting to talk economics in detail around the first of may.  ideally, we'll have a feel for the above relationships, and the transmission constraint situation, by then."
thanks.

i am trying to pull together a report on the future of the gas market in texas.
i was wondering if you have a report that shows new generation coming on in the next 3-4 years as well as a report that shows current generation.
the names of the companies building/owning the facilities is not important.
"the most important data is mw capacity as well as type of generation (i.e., natural gas, coal, etc.) do you have this information?"
"thanks, eric x3-0977"
please note that your employees have suggested the following people to complete a feedback form on their behalf.
you will need to access the performance management system (pep) to either approve or decline these suggested reviewers.
once you have approved the suggested reviewers they will be notified and can begin completing the feedback form.

"for friday soco, opc and sceg will be on the bid."
serc    16 hour average:  bid  $ 42.7  offer $ 72.5 frcc importing power into florida was again a problem up until off-peak.
for the evening peak fpl and fpc were bidding in the mid 40's.

"""fuel cells kindle investor energy by beverly goodman redherring.com, november 27, 2000 companies with no earnings."
market capitalizations in the billions even though revenue hovers in the tens of millions.
analyst optimism bordering on the feverish.
we know -- this probably sounds all too familiar.
but this time we're not talking about some pie-in-the-sky dot-com stock valuations.
"we're talking about companies with new technologies, tangible assets, and a clear source of future revenue."
"we're talking about makers of fuel cells, a highly efficient and environmentally sound means of generating electricity."
"and while we won't deny that the recent run-up in their stocks befits the pattern of investor enthusiasm for the latest fad, we at red herring expect that alternative energy will be in fashion for quite some time."
investors more interested in companies that sell dog food over the internet can stop reading here.
"there's no mystery why fuel cells are an appealing source of energy: they provide more reliable and efficient power with lower emissions and noise than traditional generating sources (see trend no. 9: energy, december 4)."
"most only require the simplest of gases and throw off only water and heat as by-products, both of which are reusable."
"simply put, fuel cells consist of hydrogen and oxygen, separated by a catalyst."
"typically, the fuel cell is heated, causing a chemical reaction that generates electricity."
"since nothing is burned, no pollutants are created."
"in time, proponents say, fuel cells will power everything from your cell phone to your car to the factories that manufacture them."
"during this era of greater environmental awareness and rising fuel prices, fuel cell technology is increasingly looking like an appealing investment."
stocks powered by fuel cell technology are up an average of 139 percent in the last 12 months.
that's despite a slow recovery from the 40 percent hit they took in the spring.
"the nasdaq, by comparison, has fallen 15 percent since last november."
"investor interest has also prompted a recent spate of ipos. h power (nasdaq: hpow), millennium cell (nasdaq: mcel), and proton energy systems (nasdaq: prtn) all went public within the past few months."
"while those ipos may seem to coincide neatly with the rising cost of fuel, that's not the whole picture. """
"""we're seeing a convergence of factors never seen before,"""" says william fogel, a power technology analyst for first albany. """
"""the deregulation in the utility industry has increased innovation; the transportation grid is in jeopardy thanks to an increase in electrical demand from an internet-based economy; there's a growing need for increased reliability; and there's an increasing recognition of the environmental degradation caused by the combustion engine."""
""" admittedly, truly widespread applications remain more than a decade away, so profits are similarly distant for fuel cell companies."
"but investors have proven themselves willing to invest in technologies long before they become mainstream, buying stocks that often defy traditional valuations."
(still holding jds uniphase (nasdaq: jdsu)?
") with early-stage fuel cell technology due out of the labs and available to individual and corporate consumers within the year, this is still the early part of the adoption (and investing) curve."
"cell division the fuel cell market is generally divided into four segments: stationary, portable, residential, and automotive."
"fuel cells will likely hit the large stationary market first, powering strip malls and factories, according to david redstone, editor of the hydrogen and fuel cell investor newsletter. """
"""we're talking about unprecedented efficiency,"""" he says, noting that fuel cells approach 60 percent efficiency (that is, 60 percent of the potential energy in fuel entering the cell actually results in energy coming out)."
"fuel cells can also be coupled with turbines to get their efficiency up to 80 percent, whereas traditional combustion engines only run at 35 percent efficiency."
"the leading developer of these stationary cells is fuelcell energy (nasdaq: fcel) (fce), which is poised to be the first to commercialize them in 2001."
"at first blush, fce's 442 percent run-up in the last 12 months and the fact that it won't be profitable until 2006 doesn't make its $59.50 stock price and price/sales ratio of 58 seem cheap."
"but using a variety of metrics, including discounted cash flow, discounted 2006 net income, and discounted 2006 revenue, lehman brothers analyst maureen murphy considers fce undervalued by 40 percent."
"using a projected market value of five times estimated 2006 revenue of $1 billion, she applies a discount rate of 17.5 percent annually to arrive at a 12-month price target of $124."
"portable applications for fuel cells, like generators and boat engines, are also expected to be commercialized soon."
"ballard power systems (nasdaq: bldp ), with more than 370 patents issued or pending, has proven itself in nearly all fuel cell applications and has promised to bring a small fuel cell-powered generator to market in 2001. """
"""they don't make promises they're not able to keep,"""" says christine farkas, a senior specialist and director at merrill lynch. """
"""they've never disappointed."""
""" ballard has also made significant strides in the automotive market and owns 27 percent of xcellsis, a fuel cell engine maker that is a joint venture with daimlerchrysler (nyse: dcx) and ford motor (nyse: f)."
"analysts expect ballard to continue to post losses until sometime in 2004, and its current price-to-sales ratio is a whopping 265."
"still, ballard's involvement in all aspects of fuel cell applications leads ms. farkas to expect the company to earn $24.22 per share by 2013 -- which works out to approximately $2.2 billion in net income."
"applying a multiple of 25 to those earnings, and a 15 percent discount rate, she comes up with a projected stock price of $150 a year from today, or 93 percent above recent prices."
"industry revolution even though powering cars with fuel cells is still some years off, the notion has found allies in some unlikely industries -- the major oil and automotive sectors."
"ford chairman william clay ford jr. declared at the 2000 detroit auto show, """"longer term, the fuel cell will end the 100-year reign of the internal combustion engine."""
""" legislation such as california's mandate that by 2003 fully 10 percent of cars sold (an estimated 22,000) must run on alternative energy will also help speed industry and public acceptance."
"while not a pure-play on fuel cells, impco technologies is well positioned to see its fuel cell business grow along with its other alternative fuel delivery, storage, and power electronics systems."
"mr. fogel expects impco's products to compete for 40 percent, or $5 billion of the forecasted $12.5 billion automotive fuel cell market in 2010."
"(its much more down-to-earth p/s ratio of 1.6 is an added attraction for investors -- any risk involved in impco's fuel cell development is hedged by its full involvement in the alternative fuel industry.) """"they're involved with almost every aspect of general motors's global alternative fuel production, design, and implementation efforts,"""" mr. fogel says."
"impco was hit particularly hard this spring, and is still, at $18, 65 percent off its march 6 high of $52."
"but by using a 45 multiple on projected 2006 earnings per share of $2.86 and applying a 20 percent discount, mr. fogel arrives at a price-to-earnings-to-growth ratio of less than one -- a conservative multiple for stocks with similar growth prospects."
"mr. fogel sees more than a 100 percent upside for the company's stock, expecting it to return to its high in the coming 12 months."
"despite the industry hype and science fiction scenarios, there will inevitably be setbacks."
"take, for example, plug power (nasdaq: plug), which ran out of gas when general electric (nyse: ge), which owns one-third of a joint venture with detroit edison (nyse: dta) and plug, decided to change course."
"plug's trailing 12-month revenue of $13 million (giving it a price-to-sales ratio of 64) hinged on the venture, in which a fuel cell powered a house, independent of the local electrical grid."
"instead, ge now wants to develop a """"grid parallel"""" system, which would work in tandem with the existing system."
"that news, coupled with management woes and nasdaq turbulence, sent plug's share price falling 80 percent, from $140 on march 13 to $16.50 on november 24."
it will take all the energy fuel cells can generate to get that stock back on track.
"discuss energy trends in the new economy in the ongoing energy industry moves forward discussion forum, or check out forums, video, and events at the discussions home page."""
"cherly, i have been promoted out of the associate program last prc."

"julie, sorry for the delayed response."
i can't express to you how excited i am to be coming out there this weekend.
after the last week and a half of work i am in desperate need of rest and relaxation (that of course means lots of shopping).
"as far as activities go, i'm pretty much up for anything."
"my guess is i'm probably going to want to take a quick nap when i get in saturday morning before starting the weekend's activities, but after that i say we just get going."
the symphony sounds incredible as do the races or the polo match so i'll just leave the final choices to your discretion.
"i would definitely be up for a trip to the zoo if you want to go, but considering i go there every time i'm in san diego i could miss it in order to do/see some other things."
the only things i insist upon are ample time outdoors and good seafood.
"anyway,  i arrive in san diego on america west flight 2180 at about 9:00 a.m. and leave monday at 6:10 p.m. so we've almost got three full days to work with."
"love, susan -- also, if you could give me an idea of what kind of items i need to pack depending on our activities it might prevent me from committing gross overpacking...thanks."

"""didn't know if you saw this... pompano refuses $10,000 `gift' from texas firm that wants power-plant ok by lisa j. huriash sun-sentinel??????"
"web-posted: 11:43 p.m. dec. 7, 2000 ???"
"pompano beach -- the city has returned a $10,000 check to a powerful texas-based company that wants to build a controversial power plant here. ???"
"enron north america, one of the world's largest energy conglomerates, has proposed a 510-megawatt plant for a 30-acre site south of sample road and east of florida's turnpike. ???"
"company officials hand-delivered the check last friday, requesting that the money be used for cultural arts programs."
the city manager returned it on tuesday. ???
"""""while your donation is believed to be a genuine and unrelated corporate support of the community, the timing of your donation has the potential of creating a false impression and perception of its intent and purpose,"""" city manager c. william hargett jr. wrote in a letter to steve krimsky, director of enron. ???"
"""""therefore, i am returning your check."""
""" ???"
the company is planning to pitch its development project to the city's planning and zoning board later this month.
eventually the issue will come before the city commission. ???
"the company hopes to start construction in april and begin operating the plant on may 1, 2002."
"it would be the fifth power plant in broward county, and the third largest. ???"
city officials applauded returning the check to enron. ???
"""""i think their intentions were very questionable,"""" said commissioner kay mcginn. """
"""the city did the honorable thing in returning the check."""
""" ???"
"""""we have been talking about cultural arts."
but did they do it for something in return?
""""" asked mayor bill griffin. """
"""the best thing we did was to return the check."""
""" ???"
"there wasn't anything improper about the gift, said eric thode, spokesman for enron. ???"
"""""the city has a right to its opinion."
i would say enron nationwide has been recognized for its philanthropic activities.
we want to be a good corporate citizen and support the community.
these are not political contributions.
"supporting cultural activities, children's activities, these are things we have typically supported in various areas where we do business,"""" he said. ???"
"when the company built a plant in illinois, for example, it also built a playground in that city, thode said. ???"
"two cities near the pompano site, margate and coconut creek, have expressed concern about the plant and air-quality regulators, worry it would rely too heavily on diesel fuel."
"diesel fuel releases nitrogen oxide, a leading cause of smog, which can worsen asthma, bronchitis and other breathing problems. ???"
"the plant would burn diesel fuel up to 1,500 hours a year, according to its permit application to the state department of environmental protection. ???"
"hargett said in his letter that he hopes when the plant controversy is over, and the timing is better, enron will come through financially. ???"
"""""hopefully, enron will continue its support of the community and consider a future donation following completion of the various matters pending before the city,"""" he wrote in his letter to krimsky. ???"
thode noted that the check was not written to the city. ???
"""""we would not cut a check directly to a city government,"""" he said. """
"""our budget has standards."""
""" ???"
"the check was made payable to the non-profit pompano beach cultural arts foundation, which raises money for city-sponsored cultural programs."
"the five city commissioners, who will vote on the power plant, act as the foundation's directors. ???"
enron officials met with coconut creek city manager john kelly and his staff thursday to discuss their concerns about the plant's impact.
"because of the area's wind conditions, the gases from the plant's 80-foot stacks would blow in the general direction of margate, coconut creek, coral springs and parkland. ???"
"kelly said it was a """"good exchange of information"""" and he expects future meetings. ???"
"""""they're trying to be the good neighbor and get into the community,"""" kelly said, referring to the returned check. """
"""it probably came off the wrong way."""
""" ???"
he added that he was relieved pompano beach returned the money. ???
"""""it gives us all a comfort level we're going to deal with it objectively,"""" he said. """
"""checks don't make the air better."""

a shepherd was herding his flocks in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand new jeep cherokee advanced out of a dust cloud towards him.

i thought that you might want to know that randy gay's wife passed away on friday evening.
randy is the manager of the west desk gas logistics group.
his wife had been on a liver transplant list for some time and had been moved up on the list several weeks ago as her condition became more severe.
"unfortunately, she developed complications during the last two weeks which resulted in her being removed from the transplant list."
randy has a four year-old daughter.
several of us will be attending the funeral today.
"over the past several weeks within ena, we have raised funds for playground equipment to complete a fund raising effort that randy's wife had headed for their civic association."
"through donations from ena employees, the original goal for the playground equipment was far exceeded."

"half-awake, and nearly paralyzed with fear, you hear muffled whispers."
at least two people have broken into your house and are moving your way.
"with your heart pumping, you reach down beside your bed and pick up your shotgun."
"you rack a shell into the chamber, then inch toward the door and open it."
"in the darkness, you make out two shadows."
one holds a weapon--it looks like a crowbar.
"when the intruder brandishes it as if to strike, you raise the shotgun and fire."
the blast knocks both thugs to the floor.
one writhes and screams while the second man crawls to the front door and lurches outside.
"as you pick up the telephone to call police, you know you're in trouble."
"in your country, most guns were outlawed years before, and the few that are privately owned are so stringently regulated as to make them useless."
yours was never registered.
police arrive and inform you that the second burglar has died.
they arrest you for first degree murder and illegal possession of a firearm.
"when you talk to your attorney, he tells you not to worry: authorities will probably plea the case down to manslaughter. """
"""what kind of sentence will i get?"
""""" you ask. """
"""only ten-to-twelve years,"""" he replies, as if that's nothing. """
"""behave yourself, and you'll be out in seven."""
""" the next day, the shooting is the lead story in the local newspaper."
"somehow, you're portrayed as an eccentric vigilante while the two men you shot are represented as choir boys."
their friends and relatives can't find an unkind word to say about them.
"buried deep down in the article, authorities acknowledge that both """"victims"""" have been arrested numerous times."
"but the next day's headline says it all: """"lovable rogue son didn't deserve to die."""
""" the thieves have been transformed from career criminals into robin hood-type pranksters."
"as the days wear on, the story takes wings."
"the national media picks it up, then the international media."
the surviving burglar has become a folk hero.
"your attorney says the thief is preparing to sue you, and he'll probably win."
the media publishes reports that your home has been burglarized several times in the past and that you've been critical of local police for their lack of effort in apprehending the suspects.
"after the last break-in, you told your neighbor that you would be prepared next time."
the district attorney uses this to allege that you were lying in wait for the burglars.
"a few months later, you go to trial."
"the charges haven't been reduced, as your lawyer had so confidently predicted."
"when you take the stand, your anger at the injustice of it all works against you."
"prosecutors paint a picture of you as a mean, vengeful man."
it doesn't take long for the jury to convict you of all charges.
the judge sentences you to life in prison.
__________________________________________ this case really happened.
"*********************************** on august 22, 1999, tony martin of emneth, norfolk, england, killed one burglar and wounded a second."
"in april, 2000, he was convicted and is now serving a life term."
how did it become a crime to defend one's own life in the once-great british empire?
it started with the pistols act of 1903.
this seemingly reasonable law forbade selling pistols to minors or felons and established that handgun sales were to be made only to those who had a license.
the firearms act of 1920 expanded licensing to include not only handguns but all firearms except shotguns.
later laws passed in 1953 and 1967 outlawed the carrying of any weapon by private citizens and mandated the registration of all shotguns.
momentum for total handgun confiscation began in earnest after the hungerford mass shooting in 1987.
"michael ryan, a mentally disturbed man with a kalashnikov rifle, walked down the streets shooting everyone he saw."
"when the smoke cleared, 17 people were dead."
"the british public, already de-sensitized by eighty years of """"gun control"""", demanded even tougher restrictions."
"(the seizure of all privately owned handguns was the objective even though ryan used a rifle.) nine years later, at dunblane, scotland, thomas hamilton used a semi-automatic weapon to murder 16 children and a teacher at a public school."
"for many years, the media had portrayed all gun owners as mentally unstable, or worse, criminals."
now the press had a real kook with which to beat up law-abiding gun owners.
"day after day, week after week, the media gave up all pretense of objectivity and demanded a total ban on all handguns."
"the dunblane inquiry, a few months later, sealed the fate of the few sidearms still owned by private citizens."
"during the years in which the british government incrementally took away most gun rights, the notion that a citizen had the right to armed self-defense came to be seen as vigilantism."
"authorities refused to grant gun licenses to people who were threatened, claiming that self-defense was no longer considered a reason to own a gun."
citizens who shot burglars or robbers or rapists were charged while the real criminals were released.
"indeed, after the martin shooting, a police spokesman was quoted as saying, """"we cannot have people take the law into their own hands."""
""" all of martin's neighbors had been robbed numerous times, and several elderly people were severely injured in beatings by young thugs who had no fear of the consequences."
"martin himself, a collector of antiques, had seen most of his collection trashed or stolen by burglars."
"when the dunblane inquiry ended, citizens who owned handguns were given three months to turn them over to local authorities."
"being good british subjects, most people obeyed the law."
the few who didn't were visited by police and threatened with ten-year prison sentences if they didn't comply.
"police later bragged that they'd taken nearly 200,000 handguns from private citizens."
how did the authorities know who had handguns?
the guns had been registered and licensed.
kinda like cars.
sound familiar?

"he informs me that he is going to be trading corn (yes, you heard me corn) for enron."
while he is very excited about trading i get the impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his vacation time.
he said that he and darren (the guy he works with) had been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week had pretty much just been one long meeting.
"it is around this time that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed."
"as a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home asap, i.e. """"i'm leaving tomorrow (friday) to go to california for a week."""

barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within ebs.
"since scott pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him in ebs that are in trading operations, i would suggest that the memo contain a mention of the transition: example: scott pleus is currently director of trading operations for ebs."
he will be transitioning to an origination role within ebs in mid may as barry pearce assumes his responsibilities for ebs.
the current trading staff for ebs will report to barry effective with his start date in may. i also heard from barry today that todd lindholm let him know that he is out of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading operations and that barry will report to john echols.
so sounds as if that is clarified.

well i bet your family just feels like i was saying the other night.
that you are to close with them to actually move.
"i wish you luck and hopefully you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just $35,000 to live in la."
"i would think the absolute minimum you should take would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus."
he has been persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you services.
in la to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.
you have got to realize it s really expensive to live there.
especially if your office is in beverly hills.
you kind of have two options.
you could live in the valley for cheaper.
but in my opinion the valley sucks.
i would never ever ever live in the valley.
or you could find somewhere in like north hollywood or maybe redondo beach.
lisa lives there (north hollywood)  and pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.
which is very reasonable for la.
maybe danny has some connections.

:
"john, i think the crucial distinction is between recognition of risks and elimination of risks through hedges (as correctly pointed out  in other messages)."
being aware of risk does not mean that one does not want to be compensated for it.
now a few more detailed comments.
1
i think that illiquidity discount represents double counting when combined with a project finance discount rate.
"illiquidity discount, in my view, should be applied to financial options that trade in a market without sufficient depth."
one should apply a haircut if liquidating  a position takes a long time.
"the approach used in valuation of the turkish transaction is the same as approach used in valuation of investments in physical assets, which are by definition illiquid."
this illiquidity  is recognized through other aspects of valuation technology used in raroc.
"if we apply an illiquidity correction in this case, we should be consistent and use this approach  across the board for all project finance type cases (not that i recommend this course of action)."
2
valuation of an unheadgable options.
let's look at it from the position of a seller of the option.
he cannot hedge a short call or put and black-scholes valuation becomes the floor for the valuation: the seller has to be compensated for taking a price risk (as opposed to taking a vol risk when he hedges).
the issue of the compensation he will require becomes fuzzy.
the option really becomes an insurance type product and pricing depends on two factors: 1.
risk preference 2.
existing portfolio positions risk preference.
insurance companies typically require a payment that consists of two parts: expected loss + unexpected loss.
the latter is typically defined as 1 to 2 standard deviations.
the number of  standard deviations depends on risk appetite and the ability to absorb the loss.
"i admit that it is a bit fuzzy, but this is the way the world works."
we looked into insurance pricing at the request of jere overdyke.
you can talk to vasant shanbhogue to find out more about it.
existing portfolio positions.
an additional contract may increase or decrease the risk of the overall portfolio.
"i would expect the deal to provide some risk diversification, but it does not look to me as a deal that reduces risk (given all our positions in this region)."
what are the practical implications?
pricing depends on risk appetite (the utility function of a decision maker in technical jargon) and becomes to some degree arbitrary.
"if we are short an option embedded in a deal and the option cannot be hedged, we should subtract from the value of the contract the value of the option (that is greater than the black - scholes value)."
"if we don't price this option explicitly, the valuation of a contract will be based on a discount rate with a risk premium."
"in the case of an option buyer, the situation is reversed."
"if he cannot hedge, he should recognize the risk of losing the value of his investment and apply a discount to the value of the option."
how big is the discount?
see the comments above.
"in the special case, where hedging is possible and the black-scholes-merton paradigm applies, both values will become equal (ignoring transaction costs)."
the values of an option form the point of view of a seller and a buyer will converge.
3
what happens in case we use simulation technology?
we can discount at the risk free rate along each scenario (each scenario will recognize the downside and/or upside at different points in time in different states of the world).
"if we run a sufficient number of scenarios, we shall get a distribution of npv as of today."
"knowing this distribution means that we can estimate risk, but in most cases we are still holding it."
"the expected value should be, therefore, adjusted for risk."
this is equivalent to using a discount rate with a risk premium.
i hope this helps.
"please, call me with additional questions."
sorry for a delay in responding to this question.
"i ran my response by stinson and vasant, to make sure we all agree."
it's a very complicated technical problem and the financial theory does not have good answers.
vince

"although we don't talk about this, i have heard (not first hand) that there will not be an opportunity for people transfer because of the deal."
i don't want to waste anyone's time if this is just an exercise  what is the scoop?

it sounds like i need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of power in ontario.
1
garrett is in toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to understand all the ins and outs of the ontario power market including building forward curves.
he has dual reporting to paul devries (head of the enron's toronto operation) and dana davies (head of ena power trading for the northeast u.s.).
dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for ontario.
2
my current opinion is that we should trade ontario out of the toronto office with risk management responsibilities rolling into dana.
this could always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.
3
"john mckay, although he has been helping bill out, will ultimately have no power trading responsibilities."
4
tom may is the cash trader in n.y. reporting to dana.
"i expect us to use tom's expertise with respect to ontario to build up our competency there, however, toms' main role will be n.y. 5."
garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in houston getting to know the people and the technical resources available to him.
if anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

frcc for the evening peak prices remained strong.
tlr's prevented any movement of power into florida during the evening peak.
tva was the culprit in calling for tlr's.
tlr's were not called off until he  22.
for he 23 and he 24 we sold 100mw's  to fpl at $41 and $36.
for he 1 they bought directly from their neighbors at $18.
"fpc, jea and teco were flat for these hours."
for hours 2-6 fpl was a  $15 bid.
due to limited hourly trans. available and the likelihood of tlr's a short schedule sale to florida was not possible.
serc tlr's were still in place for the evening peak thus limiting the import of power into serc from the north.
the eveving peak saw all of soco interfaces showing -0-.
starting he 23  the ees side of soco opened up with 150 mw's.
we were able to move cajn power into florida staring he 23.
we offered soco $45 for this hour and they passed on it.
off-peak offers were in the low 20's.
soco was a $16 bid.
no one would show a decent  bid for a 16-hr preschedule.
the guys on shift would not show a bid or offer for a 16-hr preschedule.
they will wait until the afternoon to start buying.
most of the night guys in serc believe that tlr's will once again be called by tva starting in the afternoon.

"""well, given the impressive results of friday's game, i suppose i should've taken the bet...i mean i knew we were good, but i didn't realize we were that good."
watching the game i couldn't help but remember some comments made not too long ago about this being a building season and that the horns would be a force to be reckoned with come the next two seasons - - i love it when i'm right.
"with an increasingly more confident sophomore quarterback leading the charge and three (count them three) very mature freshman receivers all eager to make big plays, not to mention last year's top quarterback recruit chance mock serving as a back-up, next season promises to be something to watch."

latest tino-gram:  apparently high power prices at 4 corners have doe excited about the project all of a sudden.
the latest configuration is in the 300-380 mw range.
tino needs us to check if the ena guys would be interested in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (i think these are basically tolling agreements--ena would pay a monthly capacity reservation charge per kw of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or $10/kw if combined cycle.
variable cost would be $.
005/kwh and fuel is whatever it is--ena's problem.
"i'm trying to get ahold of tino to confirm, but i think these are prices at the plant, not fob 4 corners."
please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ena guys.
thanks.

"sally, thanks for the email and update."
i agree that we must do something quickly to resolve this.
i believe that you should interview for summer interns as an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.
i know you were very happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at ou that you got last year ( i was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).
we cant lose that momentum.
"i am sure that each school's program is different and that most don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what i have learned about the ou schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we wait."
i am sure that is not what charlene and celeste were trying to accomplish with their guidelines.
please keep me up informed on this matter.
thanks and good luck with the students.

"""the only problem i can see with this is that paragraph 4 could be construed to encourage nmng to request amendment not only to increase the maxdtq but also to decrease it (if the maxdtq has been increased by a previous amendment)."
i worry that this might mislead nmng that the parties can decrease the maxdtq by agreement rather than nmng using capacity release procedures.
"however, the paragraph does not obligate tw to do anything & doesn't give nmng any rights, since any change in the maxdtq must be by mutual agreement (and it's subject to available capacity)."
"since it does not seem to give either party anything they do not already get under the tariff, i think i would recommend we omit it."
"however, nmng might insist on this or similar language to reflect the """"deal"""" --- or at least the conversations of the parties."
"if that's the case, i suppose i would advise the marketing folks to limit the language of paragraph 4 to an increase in maxdtq and explain that any decrease would have to be thru capacity release."

"""now that the celebrating has died down, lets decide whether to seek rehearing or clarification of the order."
"if there is anything in it that disadvantages us, we should consider rehearing, particularly since it is a nearly certain that our friends at socal will file a nasty one."
(it might be good for steve h. or bill or whoever has the best relationship with socal to make a high level courtesy call to extend the olive branch and tell them that we'll work with them to minimize their concerns blah blah blah.
"at minimum, we'll probably learn if they do intend to seek rehearing) i see two things that may be worth seeking rehearing on: 1."
the requirement that we disclose our discount agreements in 15 days.
ferc really punted this issue.
"they say that """"since the expansion capacity is fully subscribed we see no reason why transwestern should not publicly disclose the agreements. . . . """"  this is the first time i've heard of any rule that if your project is fully subscribed you therefore lose your right to confidential treatment of sensitive pricing info."
"at minimum, we could argue that the requirement is arbitrary and capricious because ferc didn't even mention its normal regulations and procedures governing filing of discount reports."
"it just cited the certificate regulation that requires an applicant to """"file"""" its rate information with the commission (which we did) and ignores the regulation (sec. 284.7(c)(6)) that doesn't require a pipeline to publicly disclose its discounts until 15 days  after the close of the billing period to which the discount pertained."
"the commercial people need to decide if we care about this issue--i.e., how upset will the customers with the high rates be when they learn about the low rates?"
"also, frank and steve and susan--since the order imposes a 15 day deadline on this issue, do we need to file for a stay first and then rehearing?"

the ecs issue.
"i think we can work around this for the gallup project, by filing a report describing the operational control tw has under the o & m agreement."
i've talked to mark knippa of ecs and he is running the idea by courtney and will get back to me today.
"my real worry is what the """"operational control"""" requirement does to our future outsourcing/ monetization projects."
"i think ecs and hanover need to have operational control over the assets in our other deals (i.e., tw compressor monetization) in order for both of us to get the accounting treatment we need to monetize the forward revenue streams."
"if we agree that tw will keep absolute operational control on this deal, ferc will use it as precedent when we come in with the tw compression deal."
"arthur anderson will crap on the monetization part of that deal (which is, after all, the whole point of doing it) if tw retains too much control over the asset."
"i'm not sure how to solve this yet, but lets all put some thought into it."

"jeff, i am sending you a recommendation regarding our cooperation with the wharton school, following my visit with tom piazze in may. tom is a corporate relations officer at wharton."
recommendation.
i am writing to you to recommend joining the wharton partnership.
the partnership is an umbrella program established to coordinate wharton school initiatives for industry-academic cooperation.
"currently, the partnership supports alliances with approximately  200 companies worldwide."
"the recommended annual contribution by enron is between $100k-150k, that puts us in the top bracket of contributing companies, such as ge, citigroup, goldman, sachs & co., intel, and many others."
the contribution is executed through grants to different research projects that would directly benefit enron.
the choice of the projects is at our discretion and can be changed over time depending on the business needs.
benefits to enron.
"enron can benefit from the partnership by: - gaining advance access to current academic research - significantly increasing our presence  and visibility on the campus, enhancing   our recruiting efforts - taking our message directly to influential academics who have significant influence on public opinion - gaining access to high quality executive education programs specific programs."
the partnership functions through involvement in different research projects.
i have identified a few projects that will maximize the benefit to enron.
1
webi (wharton e-business initiative).
"this programs provides an umbrella for different initiatives in the area of curriculum development, research and corporate engagement related to e-commerce."
main benefits: access to e-commerce research and enhanced recruitment opportunities.
2
emerging technologies management research program.
"interdisciplinary program addressing issues facing companies in new markets: managing intellectual property, participating in emerging technologies, selecting the optimal organizational structures."
benefits to enron: access to financial technology in the area of valuation of intangible assets and new forms of business organizations.
3
risk management and decision process center.
development of techniques for assessment and management of non-traditional risks (risks outside the scope of traditional insurance contracts and capital markets instruments).
"benefits to enron: access to new risk management tools, dissemination of information about our capabilities in this area."
potential users of the program at enron.
my group could coordinate the cooperation with the risk management and decision process center.
greg whalley is a potential customer for webi.
several different units of enron can be involved with  emerging technologies management research program.

"the project will apparently be 100%debt financed, with doe agreeing to pay a firm demand charge rate of between 8 and 9 cents/kwh."
that rate is supposedly high enough to service the debt on a 10 year amort.
"basis (remember, doe can only sign 10 year contracts)."
"doe is interested, says tino, because of the redundant, dedicated facilities and enhanced reliability, and because dennis and tino pitched doe on all the $$$$ doe will make from the surplus power sales."
"dennis apparently pitched them a """"share the upside"""" deal under which doe keeps most of the revenue from surplus sales."
"tino showed doe the july spot prices at 4 corners, which tino said included many days over $200/mwh and they got all excited."
doe has done a similar share the upside deal at one of its facilities in calif. tino says and they have occasionally come out net positive on elec. costs in some months so they like the approach.
tino had two questions: 1.
"does tw have 30-40,000/d of permian capacity available starting sometime in 2001 or 2002?"
"(i realize we have probably answered this question about 5 times, but lets do it again for him)."

thanks man!
"""so haskell is trying to play good guy with us on kansas ad valorem while he's trashing us at feeble."
"ena is not one of the """"largest single shippers"""" on northern, at least in the market area."
"they did that big negotiated rate deal with us, however for 300,000dth, so i expect that is what haskell is talking about."
they may in fact be the single biggest firm customer among the producer/marketer segment.
"mkm and i ought to whup up on him down in kc next week on this issue."""
"lou: i received a call from aquila this morning for a site visit, so their all set."
thanks!

"what about toomer, garner , prentice and either wesley walls or tony gonzalez for taylor and watters?"
"john, this is a skilling issue - charlene and myself are going to talk to him about several changes in the next couple of weeks."
regards delainey
the two canadian points (dawn and niagara) are quoted in us dollars so a basis can be calculated.
we also need to add nit (aeco).
john mckay manages this product.
he should know the hours of trading and which day should be selected for index calculation.

"guys, just wanted to see if you had any of these reports or knew of their where abouts: emmission profiles for the westinghouse units; application for permit to construct; and sediment samples/radioactive analysis or metal analysis."
thanks for your assistance with these documents.

"glen, i'm faxing you transwestern's signature page and declaration."
an electronic version of the declaration is attached.
"jeff, i like the memo and i'll keep my ears open for feedback."
your presence is needed more than i thought.
my gut told me that they really needed your help but its more than that.
"taking contol of that p&l is the highest return of your time and talent for egm and for enron, atleast for this quarter."
they will learn or they will be out.

"hey, do you want to go to the brown bag tomorrow?"
rr
i am troubled by your report.
perhaps we need to threaten to revoke the anmesty and impose sanctions for noncompliance?
or deputize someone mean to search file cabinets?
yikes.
would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon tomorrow?

i just looked at myu schedule and i have to work neew years eve during the day and i don't know yet about new years day..
it really isn't that big of a deal to me.
the important thing for me right now is spending my free time to go down and spend time with my sister so i could kind of care less about going to the beavers bowl game when i can just watch it on tv.
i mean it would be nice to go but it is not the slightest bit a priority for me right now.
so are you and dave seeing each other exclusively or are you dating other people?
"gentlemen, we have revised the option agreement to reflect most of your suggested changes."
please advise if the attached is acceptable.
"thank you, kay"
"steve, thanx."

thanks for including me.
sorry i was unable to attend.

what about john hopley's group?
i'll  bring em and i'll call you guys in a week or so to get the details nailed down.
"please, read."

this day is good for me.
i need your dues by cob today!
"mark, as discussed this morning."
when does cedric get back?
i can go  through them in more detail but i thought these would help.
mike
i would like to add electronic index descriptions to the database.
"please refernece gas daily publication, page three for the location of these indices."
we can simply insert the location of the electronic index where we currenly have the gas daily index survey language in the gd swaps in the database.
i would like to have electronic gd swaps for the following points.
"el paso permian, el paso , non-bondad, kern river/opal plant, socal gas, large packages."
we will need to add electronic to the product title to differentiate between the two gd swaps.
"thanks, mike grigsby"
"i'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week, as i have strep throat (michael and i got a group rate at the peditricians' office.) who should i contact?"

"saw a lot of the bulls sell summer against length in front to mitigate margins/absolute position limits/var.  as these guys are taking off the front, they are also buying back summer."
el paso large buyer of next winter today taking off spreads.
certainly a reason why the spreads were so strong on the way up and such a piece now.
really the only one left with any risk premium built in is h/j now.
"it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning."
"certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked."
"certainly understand the arguments for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $"
"""what did you think of the debate?"
"i thought, all in all, bush did a good job - mainly because he got his points and proposals across without making a fool of himself."
"gore looked awfully fake and rehearsed on stage.  do you think that the american public notices that the only issue he makes is with bush's tax cuts going to the """"wealthiest one percent""""."
"that is the biggest load of garbage i have ever heard-   i know bush can't say this but, if you do the math, the wealthiest 1% pay the most taxes notionally and proportionately to the rest of the country."
"so, if there is an across the board tax cut, obviously the wealthiest one percent will get the most notional dollars back. -e"""
"hi ben, janet has requested that we set you up with signature authority for development documents."
how do you want you name to read on the corporate documents?
"thanks, kay"
sounds good - lets see if we can start marketing the product and the capability.

this weekend i will mark up the lease and rules.
"hey allison, not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend."
"it seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it?"
how are things in your world?
you can come by whenever you want to get the check.
how much do i owe you again?
here is a presentation don and i have been working on.
"i have sent a copy to tom zenner, but please keep this very confidential."
thank you.
ben rogers
i'll let you know when i hear from him.
"here's how it is shaping up: we have a fence appointment for noon, the wednesday before thanksgiving."
"that is the first opening, but there is always a chance of a cancellation."
"just in case there is an earlier opening, the utility people will be out tomorrow."
"therefore, we need to have both dogs put up tomorrow, and the gate open."
we have a noon appointment with john foster this wednesday.
there is a $20 consulting fee.
"this is the same day michael's class sings in chapel at 115, so this isn't too bad."
"i have a 130 staff meeting, but maybe i can miss it."
"the work will not be done that day, as far as i know."
"if we have  a hope of leaving town the week of thanksgiving, we need a reservation at the kennel.  do we have one yet?"
i would say we might want one fri and sat night.
"also, we might want to consider boarding jack this week for a couple of days, so we don't have to do the crate trip."
"we should be ok saturday-wednesday, since i'm planning on being home, and paige will be home on tuesday."
kay
"yes, such as the side letter, assignments, etc.  that may be about it, but i don't trust my memory."
"since there is so much to do in such a short time, lists help!"
i am sorry that you won't be here to join us for the lunch for kristin.
it was a trick getting a date that worked for her schedule and mine.
"since this is her last official week with ena, i did want to do this before she starts her new assignment.  --sally"
"""jay, howdy from houston."
i bet it is cooler in ny.
"i don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except i changed the word """"his"""" to """"the"""" investment group."
"as far as other clarification of duties, i don't have any issue with it, but every ceo will call me and ask if this is a change in how they deal with alan or investments."
what is the status with steve and how the group is organized?
did you talk with him and let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration?
is that your official assigned work number?
"if not, we need to get one assigned before the email goes out."
"also, i am assuming that this is in the mg office not the small enron office, is that accurate?"
""""
market deals are only captured in accrual value calculations if they are in the wellhead portfolio.
i do not recall any sales currently in the wellhead portfolio.
"however, i do not see a problem with the market deals unless they were marked improperly (e.g. accrual adders)."
#name?
please take a minute and select your reviewers for the prc process.
"thanks, kay"
"david is doing well, too."
"he is working contract, having quit burlington resources about a year ago so that his work schedule could be more flexible."
"yes, tammy is still with us."
"we marked our 10 year anniversary with her in march, except for that six month period when she was with her dad in kentucky."
i truly am blessed.  --sally
cera is publishing some reports on their website that we should pay for and post on our website.
enron may already have an account.
here is an example that i scanned<br>enron north america corp.
"well, i personally would like your input, although i'm not clear who will end up with it."
kay
"chuck, thank you for the information."
"i have marked the dates on jeff's calendar, and he plans to be there."
i guess he'll get more information as the date draws closer?
we shall invite her for an interview.
"jay, have you initiated the purchases in my roth ira?"
i don't see the pending purchases online.
thanks.
dg
i disagree.
none of the problems i've had in the last 2 weeks can be attributed to changes.
there was no explanation given as to why they booked me to return a day early on the first trip to dc.
what was up with that?
"last week, i wrote down exactly the flights i wanted didn't change my plans."
"in fact, i've spent more time investigating my options by myself than i ever had before."
a travel agent ought to be able to deal with changes anyway.
"that is what business travel is all about, and has been for the 16 years i've been flying around north america, south america and europe."
i've had good agents and bad ones.
the good ones can deal with the changes and never miss a beat.
"please have my flight changed as follows: wednesday, august 2nd, change to continental flight no. 1882, departing iah at 122pm and arriving rdu at 510pm."
the remainder of the travel plans stay the same.
"thanks, kay"
brent:  unfortunately no one from my group will be able to participate in the kipp academy events this weekend.
there was some interest though in future events.
thanks.
was that your harse realities of life speech.
i thought you were aa optimist just like myself.
i belive i actually should get a lot of credit and not just contribution for this deal.
it's not often an associate helps crate $200 mm of value.
have you checked out how much snow b.c. has gotten recently and how much there about to get - its incredible.
this is going to be a great ski season.
ben
well you cant just take away the dinner offer.
i just don't want to get you in trouble with dave.
"i know stacey has softball games tonight, i could possibly meet you depending on the time."
what time were you thinking?

"i talked with choby and ob yesterday and it looks like our old apartment (q42) as well as john, alan and jimmy's old apt (q44) will be attending their wedding."
i can already begin to see the craziness.
see ya ben
southwest gas currently views enron online but is afraid to transact physical volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on enron online are different than non-eol trades.
they stated that they reveiwed the eol contract and that it does not address payment.
i told them that the payment terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.
can you send them something.
"jeff, the meeting is scheduled  for  wednesday afternoon."
